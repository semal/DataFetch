27722794,27722794,Gene-gene interaction between CD40 and CD226 gene on systemic lupus erythematosus in the Chinese Han population.,"The aim of the study is to investigate the impact of CD40 and CD226 gene single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and additional gene-gene interaction on systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) risk in Chinese Han populations. Three SNPs were selected for genotyping in the case-control study: rs4810485, rs763361, and rs3765456. Logistic regression was performed to investigate association between SNP within CD40 and CD226 and SLE. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) was used to analyze the interaction among three SNPs. Logistic regression analysis showed that SLE risk was significantly higher in carriers of T allele of rs4810485 in CD40 gene than those with GG genotype (GT+ TT vs GG), adjusted OR (95 % CI) 1.84 (1.40-2.29). In addition, we also found SLE risk was also significantly higher in carriers of rs763361 T allele within CD226 gene than those with CC genotype (CT+ TT vs CC), adjusted OR (95 % CI) 1.89 (1.38-2.13). GMDR analysis suggested a potential gene-gene interaction between rs4810485 and rs763361. Overall, cross-validation consistency of the two-locus model was 10/10, and the testing accuracy was 62.17 %. We also found that subjects with GT or TT of rs4810485 and CT or TT of rs763361 genotype have the highest SLE risk, compared with subjects with GG of rs4810485 and CC of rs763361 genotype, and OR (95 % CI) was 2.14 (1.67-3.08), after covariates adjustment. Our results support an important association of rs4810485 in CD40 gene and rs763361 in CD226 gene polymorphism, combined effect of rs4810485 and rs763361 with increased risk of SLE."
27712136,27712136,Association between the variability of ABCA13 gene and the risk of major depressive disorder and schizophrenia in Han Chinese population.,"The ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily is one of the largest membrane protein families which is responsible for transportation of substances across the membranes by utilizing energy.

27690381,27690381,Association of Apolipoprotein C3 Genetic Polymorphisms with the Risk of Ischemic Stroke in the Northern Chinese Han Population.,"The apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3) gene, which is a member of the APOA1/C3/A4/A5 gene cluster, plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism. Dyslipidemia is an important risk factor for ischemic stroke. In the present study, we performed a hospital-based case-control study of 895 ischemic stroke patients and 883 control subjects to examine the effects of four APOC3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs2854116, rs2854117, rs4520 and rs5128) on the risk of ischemic stroke in a northern Chinese Han population. The SNaPshot Multiplex sequencing assay was used for SNP genotyping, and the potential association of genotype distributions and allele frequencies with ischemic stroke was analyzed statistically. Compared with the GG genotype, the CC+GC genotype of rs5128 was significantly associated with an increased risk in females (adjusted OR = 3.38, 95% CI = 1.82-6.28, P <0.01) after all of the risk factors were adjusted for with logistic regression analyses. A similar relationship was found between the rs4520 polymorphism and ischemic stroke risk in Han Chinese women. Under a recessive genetic model, the TT+TC genotypes of this variant increased ischemic stroke risk (adjusted OR = 2.05; 95% CI = 1.28-3.29; P <0.01). Haplotype analysis revealed that in males, the T-C-T-C haplotype of rs2854116-rs2854117-rs4520-rs5128 was significantly more frequent in the ischemic stroke group than in the control group (OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.18-1.87, P<0.01). The results of our study indicate that the APOC3 polymorphisms contribute to ischemic stroke susceptibility in females in the northern Chinese Han population."

However, the genetic association between TLR3 and asthma remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of polymorphisms within TLR3 on asthma risk and asthma-related phenotypes in the Chinese Han population. A total number of 462 unrelated adult patients with asthma and 398 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. The genotypes of tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR3 gene were determined using multiplex SNaPshot SNP genotyping assays. Case-control and case-only studies were used to assess any links with asthma and asthma-related phenotypes. The results showed that the genetic variants in TLR3 were associated with asthma-related phenotypes, including eosinophil counts, serum immunoglobulin E levels and lung function. However, there was no obvious association between the TLR3 SNPs and asthma susceptibility or asthma severity. TLR3 polymorphisms may play a considerable role in the pathogenesis of asthma. It will help in better understanding the pathogenesis of asthma and development of more effective strategies for the prevention, prediction and treatment of asthma."

To determine whether eight novel Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) have associations with breast cancer risk in women from southeast China, we conducted a case-control study of 1,156 breast cancer patients and 1,256 healthy controls. We first validated that the SNPs rs12922061, rs2290203, and rs2981578 were associated with overall breast cancer risk in southeast Chinese women, with the per-allele OR of 1.209 (95%CI: 1.064-1.372), 1.176 (95%CI: 1.048-1.320), and 0.852 (95%CI: 0.759-0.956), respectively. Rs12922061 and rs2290203 even passed the threshold for Bonferroni correction (P value: 0.00625). In stratified analysis, we found another three SNPs were significantly associated within different subgroups. However, after Bonferroni correction (P value: 0.000446), there were no statistically significant was observed. In gene-environment interaction analysis, we observed gene-environment interactions played a potential role of in the risk of breast cancer. These findings provide new insight into the associations between the genetic susceptibility and fine classifications of breast cancer. Based on these results, we encourage further large series studies and functional research to confirm these finding."
27669275,27669275,Polymorphisms in GEMIN4 and AGO1 Genes Are Associated with the Risk of Lung Cancer: A Case-Control Study in Chinese Female Non-Smokers.,"MicroRNA biosynthesis genes can affect the regulatory effect of global microRNAs to target mRNA and hence influence the genesis and development of human cancer. Here, we selected five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs7813, rs2740349, rs2291778, rs910924, rs595961) in two key microRNA biosynthesis genes (GEMIN4 and AGO1) and systematically evaluated the association between these SNPs, the gene-environment interaction and lung cancer risk. To control the impact of cigarette smoking on lung cancer, we recruited Chinese female non-smokers for the study. The total number of lung cancer cases and cancer-free controls were 473 and 395 in the case-control study. Four SNPs showed statistically significant associations with lung cancer risk. After Bonferroni correction, rs7813 and rs595961 were evidently still associated with lung cancer risk. In the stratified analysis, our results revealed that all five SNPs were associated with the risk of lung adenocarcinoma; after Bonferroni correction, significant association was maintained for rs7813, rs910924 and rs595961. Haplotype analysis showed GEMIN4 haplotype C-A-G-T was a protective haplotype for lung cancer. In the combined unfavorable genotype analysis, with the increasing number of unfavorable genotypes, a progressively increased gene-dose effect was observed in lung adenocarcinoma. We also found that individuals exposed to cooking oil fumes showed a relatively high risk of lung cancer, but no interactions were found between cooking oil fume exposure or passive smoking exposure with these SNPs, either on an additive scale or a multiplicative scale. Overall, this is the first study showing that rs7813 and rs595961 could be meaningful as genetic markers for lung cancer risk."
27660057,27660057,Associations of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase genetic polymorphisms with smoking cessation in a Chinese population.,"Recently, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) A503V (rs1057868) in cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) gene was reported to influence nicotine metabolism. Considering the importance of nicotine metabolism to smoking cessation, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between POR gene polymorphisms and smoking cessation in a Chinese population. A case-control study was conducted with 363 successful smoking quitters as the cases, and 345 failed smoking quitters as the controls. Eight tagSNPs which cover the entire gene and four functional SNPs were selected and genotyped. Logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between POR SNPs and smoking cessation in codominant, additive, dominant and recessive models. After adjustment for potential confounders, multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that POR rs3823884 and rs3898649 were associated with increased possibility of smoking cessation. Meanwhile, POR rs17685 and rs239953 were shown to have negative effect on successful smoking cessation. No significant differences in the distribution of haplotypes between cases and controls were detected. In conclusion, this study reveals that four SNPs in the POR gene (rs3823884, rs3898649, rs239953 and rs17685) may affect the susceptibility of smoking cessation in a Chinese Han population."
27650191,27650191,The seed dormancy allele TaSdr-A1a associated with pre-harvest sprouting tolerance is mainly present in Chinese wheat landraces.,"We cloned TaSdr - A1 gene, and developed a gene-specific marker for TaSdr - A1 . A QTL for germination index at the TaSdr - A1 locus was identified in the Yangxiaomai/Zhongyou 9507 RIL population. Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) affects yield and end-use quality in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). In the present study we found an association between the TaSdr-A1 gene and PHS tolerance in bread wheat. TaSdr-A1 on chromosome 2A was cloned using a homologous cloning approach. Sequence analysis of TaSdr-A1 revealed an SNP at position 643, with the G allele being present in genotypes with lower germination index (GI) values and A in those with higher GI. These alleles were designated as TaSdr-A1a and TaSdr-A1b, respectively. A cleaved amplified polymorphism sequence (CAPS) marker Sdr2A based on the SNP was developed, and linkage mapping and QTL analysis were conducted to confirm the association between TaSdr-A1 and seed dormancy. Sdr2A was located in a 2.9 cM interval between SSR markers Xgwm95 and Xgwm372. A QTL for GI at the TaSdr-A1 locus explained 6.6, 7.3, and 8.2 % of the phenotypic variances in a Yangxiaomai/Zhongyou 9507 RIL population grown at Beijing, Shijiazhuang, and the averaged data from the two environments, respectively. Two sets of Chinese wheat cultivars used for validating the TaSdr-A1 polymorphism and the corresponding gene-specific marker Sdr2A showed that TaSdr-A1 was significantly associated with GI. Among 29 accessions with TaSdr-A1a, 24 (82.8 %) were landraces, indicating the importance of Chinese wheat landraces as sources of PHS tolerance. This study identified a novel PHS resistance allele TaSdr-A1a mainly presented in Chinese landraces and it is likely to be the causal gene for QPhs.ccsu-2A.3, providing new information for an understanding of seed dormancy."
27650867,27650867,MicroRNA-137 Inhibits EFNB2 Expression Affected by a Genetic Variant and Is Expressed Aberrantly in Peripheral Blood of Schizophrenia Patients.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous and non-coding single-stranded RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides, many of which are evolutionarily conserved. Genome-wide association studies have identified a robust statistical association between the MIR137 gene and schizophrenia in Europeans, which was replicated in the Han Chinese population in a case-control study. In the previous study, we provided evidence for a significant association between the EFNB2 gene and schizophrenia in Han Chinese subjects. In the current study, we utilized computational analysis, vector construction of point mutations, luciferase reporter assays and gene expression assays including RT-qPCR and western blotting methods to investigate miR-137 directly targeting EFNB2 gene and explore the reversal effect of a genetic variant of SNP rs550067317 in the putative seed-pair region of EFNB2 3'-UTR. We also found that miR-137 could be detected in the peripheral blood of a cohort of first-onset schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, and the area under curve was 0.795 (95% confidence interval 0.700-0.890), which is a middle diagnostic value for disease, suggesting that it might be valuable for diagnosing schizophrenia. In summary, this study would improve our understanding of the role of miR-137 in schizophrenia-associated signaling pathways and identify the genetic basis of rs550067317 for schizophrenia. Furthermore, we provided new evidence for the involvement of miR-137 in the etiology and diagnosis of schizophrenia, which might contribute to the discovery of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the disease."
27665685,27665685,Association of HMGB1 Gene Polymorphisms with Risk of Colorectal Cancer in a Chinese Population.,"BACKGROUND Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. More advanced work is required in the detection of biomarkers for CRC susceptibility and prognosis. High-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is an angiogenesis-related gene reported to be associated with the development of CRC. The direct evidence of HMGB1 gene polymorphisms as biomarkers for CRC has not been reported previously. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 240 CRC patients and 480 healthy controls were periodically enrolled. DNA was extracted from blood specimens. The distributions of SNPs of HMGB1 were determined by using the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. RESULTS In this case-control study, we observed a significant association between overall CRC risk and SNP rs2249825 (CG vs. CC and GG vs. CC). Participants carrying both rs2249825 CG (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.89 to 3.78) and rs2249825 GG genotypes (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.13 to 4.73) had a significantly increased risk of developing CRC compared to those carrying GG genotype. rs2249825 was associated with the risk of CRC in the dominant model but not in the recessive model. However, we found no significant differences in the rs1412125 or rs1045411 polymorphisms in the HMGB1. Advanced analyses showed that the number of rs2249825 G alleles showed a significant relationship with risk of CRC. CONCLUSIONS Our results show an association between HMGB1 rs2249825 SNP and CRC incidence in the Chinese Han population. However, population-based studies with more subjects and prognostic effects are needed to verify the association of HMGB1 SNPs with CRC susceptibility, severity, and long-term prognosis."

We examined 467 patients with active PTB and 504 healthy controls living in Xi'an and the surrounding area. Eight P2X7R SNPs were genotyped, and association analysis was performed. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were tested by unconditional logistic regression analysis to evaluate the effects of the polymorphisms on PTB risk. P2X7R SNP association analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 statistical packages and Microsoft Excel, SNP stats software, Haploview software package (version 4.2), and SHEsis software platform. The results show that the ""C"" allele of rs656612 in the P2X7R gene was associated with an increased PTB risk by the additive model (OR = 1.307, 95% CI = 1.088-1.570, P = 0.004) and dominant model (rs656612, OR = 1.490, 95% CI = 1.153-1.926, P = 0.002). The ""A"" allele of rs208290 showed an increased PTB risk by the additive model (OR = 1.418, 95% CI = 1.179-1.706, P < 0.001) and dominant model (OR = 1.680, 95% CI = 1.297-2.177, P < 0.001), whereas the ""A"" allele of rs7958311 showed an increased risk by the additive model (rs7958311, OR = 1.260, 95% CI = 1.055-1.505, P = 0.011) and recessive model (OR = 1.609, 95% CI = 1.200-2.158, P = 0.001). After Bonferroni correction, rs208290 was found to be associated with PTB in the allele, dominant, and genotype models. In conclusion, our study revealed a significant association between three P2X7R gene polymorphisms (rs656612, rs208290, and rs7958311) and PTB in a Tibetan Chinese population."
27637086,27637086,A single-nucleotide polymorphism in MMP9 is associated with decreased risk of steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head.,"Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common hip joint disease, and steroid-induced ONFH accounts for a large number of cases. Here, we examined eight previously-identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MPP2 and MPP9 genes of 285 steroid-induced ONFH patients and 507 healthy controls from northern China to determine whether these SNPs were associated with the risk of developing steroid-induced ONFH. Chi-squared tests and genetic model and haplotype analyses were used to evaluate associations. The rs2274755 SNP in MMP9 was associated with a decreased risk of steroid-induced ONFH in the allele, dominant, and additive models. Additionally, the ""CGC"" MMP9 haplotype was associated with a 0.69-fold decrease in the risk of steroid-induced ONFH. Although additional, larger population-based studies are needed to confirm these findings, our results reveal for the first time an association between a MMP9 SNP at the rs2274755 locus and a decreased risk of steroid-induced ONFH in a northern Chinese population."
27629107,27629107,Age at menarche and age at natural menopause in East Asian women: a genome-wide association study.,"Age at menarche (AM) and age at natural menopause (ANM) are complex traits with a high heritability. Abnormal timing of menarche or menopause is associated with a reduced span of fertility and risk for several age-related diseases including breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis. To identify novel genetic loci for AM or ANM in East Asian women and to replicate previously identified loci primarily in women of European ancestry by genome-wide association studies (GWASs), we conducted a two-stage GWAS. Stage I aimed to discover promising novel AM and ANM loci using GWAS data of 8073 women from Shanghai, China. The Stage II replication study used the data from another Chinese GWAS (n = 1230 for AM and n = 1458 for ANM), a Korean GWAS (n = 4215 for AM and n = 1739 for ANM), and de novo genotyping of 2877 additional Chinese women. Previous GWAS-identified loci for AM and ANM were also evaluated. We identified two suggestive menarcheal age loci tagged by rs79195475 at 10q21.3 (beta = -0.118 years, P = 3.4 × 10"

The purpose of this study was to explore the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms of METTL21C and peak bone mineral density (BMD), body mass index, total fat mass (TFM), and total lean mass (TLM) in Chinese young men. Fifteen tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped, and haplotype blocks were derived in 400 Chinese male nuclear families. The peak BMD of the lumbar and hip, TFM, and TLM were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The association analyses were performed by a quantitative transmission disequilibrium test. Both TLM and TFM had a significant positive effect on peak BMD, but the positive regulation of TLM was stronger than that of TFM. After 1000 permutations, significant within-family associations were found between rs9585961 and lumbar spine BMD and femoral neck BMD, rs9518810 and femoral neck BMD, and rs599976 and body mass index, TFM, and percentage fat mass (all P < 0.05). The association analyses with haplotypes showed that haplotype AG in block 1 was significantly associated with TFM (P = 0.031) and haplotype CAG in block 2 was significantly associated with lumbar spine BMD (P = 0.020). Our study, for the first time, demonstrates that the polymorphisms and haplotypes of METTL21C contribute to the peak BMD and TFM in Chinese males, which suggests that as a quantitative trait locus with potential pleiotropy it may have an influence on osteoporosis and obesity."

27623071,27623071,SP110 and PMP22 polymorphisms are associated with tuberculosis risk in a Chinese-Tibetan population.,"Susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB) is partially dependent on host genetic variability. SP110 and PMP22 are candidate genes identified in this study as associated with human susceptibility to TB. Here we performed an association analysis in a case-control study of a Tibetan population (217 cases and 383 controls). Using bioinformatics methods, we identified two SNPs in SP110 that may decrease susceptibility to TB (rs4327230, p<0.001, OR: 0.37, 95%CI: 0.25-0.55; rs2114591, p<0.001, OR: 0.59, 95%CI: 0.45-0.78), whereas one SNP in PMP22 appeared to increase TB risk (rs13422, p=0.003, OR: 1.45, 95%CI: 1.14-1.84). SNPs rs4327230 and rs2114591 remained significant after Bonferroni correction (p<0.00178). We found that the ""GC"" haplotype in SP110 was protective against TB, with a 64% reduction in disease risk. ""CA"" and ""CG"" in PMP22 were also associated with a protective effect. Our study indicates there is an association between specific gene polymorphisms and TB risk in a Tibetan population, and may help to identify those TB-affected individuals most susceptible to disease."

We performed a case-control study to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of hOGG1 are associated with GC risk in a Chinese population. Two potential functional tagSNPs (rs159153 and rs1052133) and a previously reported risk SNP (rs125701) were genotyped in 1,275 GC patients and 1,436 controls. We found that SNP rs125701 G > A was significantly associated with the increased GC risk [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05-1.79 in additive model]. Besides, the functional studies demonstrated that the minor A allele of rs125701 significantly reduced the transcriptional activity of hOGG1 promoter and enhanced the methylation level of CpG site of cg15357639. In conclusion, our results suggested that the SNP rs125701 in hOGG1 promoter was associated with the elevated GC risk, which could act as a new potential biomarker for GC susceptibility. Further functional verification of rs125701 in GC pathogenesis is warranted."

27610941,27610941,Genome-wide association study for semen traits of the bulls in Chinese Holstein.,"A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed to identify markers and candidate genes for five semen traits in the Holstein bull population in China. The analyzed dataset consisted of records from 692 bulls from eight bull stations; each bull was genotyped using the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip. Association tests between each trait and the 41 188 informative high-quality SNPs were achieved with gapit software. In total, 19 suggestive significant SNPs, partly located within the reported QTL regions or within or close to the reported candidate genes, associated with five semen traits were detected. By combining our GWAS results with the biological functions of these genes, eight novel promising candidate genes, including ETNK1, PDE3A, PDGFRB, CSF1R, WT1, DSCAML1, SOD1 and RUNX2, were identified that potentially relate to semen traits. Our findings may provide a basis for further research on the genetic mechanism of semen traits and marker-assisted selection of such traits in Holstein bulls."
27622501,27622501,A Functional Polymorphism (rs10817938) in the XPA Promoter Region Is Associated with Poor Prognosis of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma in a Chinese Han Population.,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms of XPA gene have been studied in several cancers such as rs10817938, rs2808668. However, the role of XPA polymorphisms in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear. Thus, we analyzed the association of XPA polymorphisms with OSCC risk, clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis in the present study. TaqMan genotyping was used to evaluate the frequency of rs10817938, rs2808668 polymorphisms in OSCC patients. The prognostic significance of these polymorphisms was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves, Log-Rank analyses, and the Cox proportional hazard model. Luciferase reporter assay, RT-PCR and western blot were used to determine whether rs10817938 could influence transcription activity and XPA expression. The results showed that individuals carrying TC and CC genotypes had significantly greater risk of developing OSCC (OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.04-1.93; OR = 2.75, 95% CI 1.32-5.71, respectively) when compared with wild-type TT genotype at rs10817938. OSCC patients with C allele at rs10817938 were more susceptible to lymph metastases, poor pathological differentiation and late TNM stage (OR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.17-2.37; OR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.18-2.28; OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.11-2.14; respectively). A significant gene-environment interaction between smoking and CC genotype at rs10817938 was observed (COR = 3.60, 95% CI 1.20-10.9) and data also showed that OSCC patients with CC genotype and C allele had worse survival (p<0.001 for both). The T to C substitution at rs10817938 significantly decreased transcription activity of XPA gene, XPA mRNA and protein were also decreased in individuals with C allele at rs10817938. In addition, no significant association of rs2808668 polymorphism with OSCC risk, prognosis could be observed. In conclusion, the present study showed that XPA rs10817938 polymorphism is a functional SNP in vitro and in vivo and a biomarker for poor prognosis in OSCC patients."
27577070,27577070,A single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3'-UTR of STAT3 regulates its expression and reduces risk of pancreatic cancer in a Chinese population.,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the deadliest solid malignancies carrying a gloomy 5-year survival rate less than 5%. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a common transcriptional regulator, whose aberrant expression has been widely found in human cancers, including PC. Our current study aimed to illustrate the roles of common variants, in the three prime untranslated region (3'UTR) of STAT3, in modifying the risk of PC through two-stage case-control studies integrating biological experiments. We first explored the associations between two common variants (rs1053004 and rs1053005) and PC risk in 774 PC cases and 777 controls. Only rs1053004 T > C showed a significant association with a reduced risk of PC with an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.85 (0.74-0.98). Then we attempted to validate the association in another 940 cases and 1398 controls, and the significant association persisted with OR (95%CI) of 0.86 (0.76-0.97). Dual luciferase reporter gene assays indicated that C allele conferred a higher expression of STAT3 in three PC cell lines including Panc-1 (P = 3.0 × 10-3), BxPC-3 (P = 6.7 × 10-5) and SW1990 (P = 4.0 × 10-3). In conclusion, the current study provided evidence that rs1053004 T > C in 3'UTR of STAT3 may decrease the risk of PC through up-regulating the gene expression."
27567908,27567908,Association Between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in NFATC1 Signaling Pathway Genes and Susceptibility to Congenital Heart Disease in the Chinese Population.,"The nuclear factor of activated T lymphocytes (NFATC1) signaling has been demonstrated to play important roles in cardiac valve and septal development. Genetic variants in genes involved in NFATC1 signaling may affect their expression and promote the formation of congenital heart disease (CHD). The goal of this study was to investigate the associations of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in seven genes (NFATC1, VEGFR, VEGF, RANKL, FGFR1, BCL-6 and ZNRD1) with the risk of CHD. Twenty-nine polymorphisms were genotyped by using MassARRAY RS1000 platform in 277 CHD child patients and 293 controls from the Henan Province in China. Fours SNPs were excluded for the association analysis because of deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Of the 25 SNPs, only two were found to be significantly associated with increased CHD risk after Bonferroni correction (RANKL, rs4531631: homozygous, AA vs. GG; OR 2.38, 95 % CI 1.40-4.07, p = 0.001; recessive, AA vs. AG + GG; OR 2.54, 95 % CI 1.53-4.22, p = 0.0003; FGFR1, rs13317: recessive, CC vs. CT + TT; OR 2.06, 95 % CI 1.30-3.25, p = 0.00196). Our findings suggest rs4531631 and rs13317 may be potential biomarkers for genetic diagnosis and treatment of CHD."
27565872,27565872,Effect of Genetic Variations within the I-mfa Gene on the Growth Traits of Chinese Cattle.,"I-mfa (inhibitor of the MyoD family a) is a transcription modulator that binds to MyoD family members and inhibits their transcriptional activities. It is highly expressed in the sclerotome and plays an important role in the patterning of the somite early in development. In this study, the polymorphisms of the bovine I-mfa gene were detected by polymerase chain reaction-single stranded conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and DNA pool sequencing methods in 541 individuals from three Chinese cattle breeds. The results showed that P3 locus had two novel complete linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (NC_007324.4:g.12284A>G and g.12331T>C), resulting in a missense mutation p.S(AGC)113G(GGC) and a synonymous mutation p.H(CAT)128H(CAC), respectively. P4 locus had a novel SNP (NC_007324.4: g.16432C>A), which resulted in a nonsense mutation p.C(TGC)241X(TGA). The statistical analyses indicated that the three SNPs, are associated with the phenotypic traits in Luxi (LX), Qinchuan (QC), and Jiaxian (JX) cattle population (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The mutant-type variants were superior for growth traits; the heterozygote diplotype was associated with higher growth traits compared to wild-type homozygote. Our results provide evidence that polymorphisms in the I-mfa gene are associated with growth traits and may be used for marker-assisted selection in beef cattle breeding program."
27567922,27567922,Association of GWAS-Supported Variants rs556621 on Chromosome 6p21.1 with Large Artery Atherosclerotic Stroke in a Southern Chinese Han Population.,"Recent genome-wide association study associated rs556621 on chromosome 6p21.1 with the risk of large artery atherosclerotic (LAA) stroke in Caucasians. However, subsequent replicate studies showed conflict results in different ethnicities. This study aimed to evaluate whether rs556621 was associated with LAA stroke in Chinese Han population. In this case-control study, 659 patients with LAA stroke and 650 healthy controls were enrolled. Associations between rs556621 genotypes and LAA stroke were analyzed with logistic regression model. Rs556621 variants were associated with increased risks of LAA stroke (codominant model: OR 1.42; 95 % CI 1.01-1.99; P = 0.010; recessive model: OR 1.40; 95 % CI 1.05-1.86; P = 0.003). When subjects were stratified by sex, TT genotype of SNP rs556621 was associated with an increased risk of LAA stroke in female when tested with recessive model (OR 2.36; 95 % CI 1.28-4.36, P = 0.006). In male subjects, however, no significant association was detected. Smoking status, sex did not significantly influence the relationship between genotypes of rs556621 and risk of LAA stroke (P"

A total of four tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TNFSF4 region, including rs7514229, rs1234313, rs16845607 and rs3850641, were genotyped using the method of ligase detection reaction. An association between GG genotype of rs3850641 in TNFSF4 gene and AITDs was found (p = 0.046). Additionally, the clinical sub-phenotype analysis revealed a significant association between GG genotype in rs7514229 and AITDs patients who were ≤18 years of age. Furthermore, rs3850641 variant allele G was in strong association with hypothyroidism in Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) (p = 0.018). The polymorphisms of the TNFSF4 gene may contribute to the susceptibility to AITDs pathogenesis."
27546826,27546826,Association of DYRK1A polymorphisms with sporadic Parkinson's disease in Chinese Han population.,"α-Synuclein plays important roles in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) pathologies. The dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) has a wide range of phosphorylation targets including α-synuclein. Posphorylated α-synuclein is more neurotoxic to dopamine (DA) neurons, but little is known about the genetic variation of DYRK1A in patients with PD. The present investigation aimed to explore the possible association of DYRK1A gene with PD in Chinese Han population. A total of 268 PD patients and 268 healthy-matched individuals in Chinese Han population were enrolled. Genotyping of rs8126696, rs2835740, and rs1137600 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were performed on the Sequenom MassARRAY platform. Results revealed TT genotype in SNP rs8126696 denoted a significant difference between PD patients and controls (OR=1.710, 95% CI=1.116-2.619, P=0.014), and the frequency of rs8126696 TT genotype was significantly higher in male PD patients than male controls (OR=2.012, 95%CI: 1.125-3.599, p=0.018). The genotypes in rs2835740 and rs1137600 showed no significant difference between PD patients and controls. These results suggest that TT genotype derived from SNP rs8126696 of DYRK1A gene is a possible risk factor for sporadic PD, especially for males in this Chinese Han population."
27586871,27586871,Functional SNP in 3'-UTR MicroRNA-Binding Site of ZNF350 Confers Risk for Age-Related Cataract.,"Many studies have suggested that individual susceptibility to age-related cataract (ARC) may be associated with DNA sequence polymorphisms affecting gene regulation. As DNA repair is implicated in ARC pathogenesis and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 3'-terminal untranslated region (3'-UTR) targeted by microRNAs (miRNAs) can alter the gene function, we hypothesize that the miRNA-binding SNPs (miRSNPs) in DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathways might associate with ARC risk. We genotyped nine miRSNPs of eight genes in DSBR and NER pathways in Chinese population and found that ZNF350- rs2278414:G>A was significantly associated with ARC risk. Even though the Comet assay of cellular DNA damage indicated that all the subtypes of ARC patients had more DNA breaks in peripheral lymphocytes than the controls independent of rs2278414 genotypes, individuals carrying the variant A allele (AA and AG) had lower ZNF350 mRNA levels compared with individuals with GG genotype. Moreover, the in vitro experiment indicated that miR-21-3p and miR-150-5p specifically downregulated luciferase reporter expression in the cell lines transfected with rs2278414 A allele compared with rs2278414 G. These results suggested that the association of SNP rs2278414 with ARC might involve an altered miRNA regulation of ZNF350."
27542340,27542340,Association between genetic variations of NMDA receptor NR3 subfamily genes and heroin addiction in male Han Chinese.,"Growing amounts of evidence suggest that N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor mediated glutamate neurotransmission may be involved in the pathophysiology of drug dependence. The NMDA receptor consists of three subfamilies (NR1, NR2, and NR3). The ability of subunit NR3 to negatively modulate the NMDA receptor function makes it an attractive candidate gene of heroin addiction. The purpose of this study is to explore the association between four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NR3 gene and heroin addiction. Genotyping of two SNPs (rs3739722 and rs17189632) in GRIN3A and two SNPs (rs4807399 and rs2240158) in GRIN3B was performed using TaqMan SNP genotyping method. The association between heroin addiction and these SNPs was assessed among 332 male heroin dependent patients and 400 male normal control subjects. The results showed the genotype and allele frequencies of rs17189632 and rs2240158 were significantly different between the cases and the controls (nominal P values were 0.0284, 0.0136 for rs17189632; 0.0048, 0.0013 for rs2240158, respectively). After Bonferroni correction, rs2240158 of GRIN3B was still found to be associated with heroin addiction. The frequencies of haplotype C-A at GRIN3A (rs3739722-rs17189632) and of C-C and C-T at GRIN3B (rs4807399-rs2240158) differed significantly between the cases and the controls. The genotype and allele distributions of rs3739722 and rs4807399 were not significantly different between in the cases and in the controls (P>0.05). These results suggest that GRIN3A rs17189632 and GRIN3B rs2240158 may contribute to the susceptibility of heroin addiction."

27533457,27533457,Impacts of the mTOR gene polymorphisms rs2536 and rs2295080 on breast cancer risk in the chinese population.,"Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) gene polymorphisms exert the major effects on the regulation of transcriptional activity and miRNA binding or splicing, which may be associated with cancer risk by affecting mTOR gene expression. However, inconsistent results have been previously reported. The present study evaluated the correlation between mTOR rs2536/rs2295080 polymorphisms and breast cancer risk. This case-control study was performed with 560 breast cancer patients and 583 healthy controls from the northwest of China. mTOR polymorphisms (rs2536 and rs2295080) were genotyped by Sequenom MassARRAY. We assessed the associations with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). The association between mTOR rs2536 polymorphism and breast cancer risk was undetectable in our study (P > 0.05). In parallel, the significant effects were observed between mTOR rs2295080 polymorphism and breast cancer risk in the allele, codominant, and recessive models (P < 0.05). We detected no significant correlations between rs2536 polymorphism and the clinical parameters of breast cancer patients, while rs2295080 polymorphism was associated with lymph node (LN) metastasis. The Crs2536Grs2295080 haplotype was correlated with a significantly decreased risk of breast cancer (P < 0.05). In sum, the findings suggested that mTOR rs2295080 had a protective role on breast cancer susceptibility among Chinese population, while rs2536 polymorphism had no association with breast cancer risk."

27530449,27530449,Interaction Between Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor δ and Epithelial Membrane Protein 2 Polymorphisms Influences HDL-C Levels in the Chinese Population.,"Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) are transcription factors involved in the regulation of key metabolic pathways. Numerous in vivo and in vitro studies have established their important roles in lipid metabolism. A few SNPs in PPAR genes have been reported to be associated with lipid levels. In this study, we aimed to investigate the interactive effects between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three PPAR isoforms α/δ/γ and other genetic variants across the genome on plasma high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. Study subjects (N = 2003) were genotyped using Illumina HumanOmniZhongHua-8 Beadchip. Fifty-three tag SNPs ± 100 kb of PPAR α, δ, and γ (r(2) < 0.2) were selected. The effect of interactions between PPAR SNPs and those across the genome on HDL-C was tested using linear regression models. One statistically significant interaction influencing HDL-C was detected between PPARδ SNP rs2267668 and epithelial membrane protein 2 (EMP2) downstream SNP rs7191411 (N = 1993, β = 0.74, adjusted P = 0.022). This interaction was successfully replicated in the meta-analysis of two additional Chinese cohorts (N = 3948, P = 0.01). The present study showed a novel SNP × SNP interaction between rs2267668 in PPARδ and rs7191411 in EMP2 that has significant impact on circulating HDL-C levels in the Singaporean Chinese population."
27686078,27686078,Association of ACYP2 and TSPYL6 Genetic Polymorphisms with Risk of Ischemic Stroke in Han Chinese Population.,"The development of ischemic stroke is associated with advanced age. Telomere length, as a marker of biological aging, has been reported to influence the risk of several age-related diseases, including ischemic stroke. Recent studies have identified the genetic variant within ACYP2 and TSPYL6 associated with shorter telomere length. The objective of this study is to investigate the putative association of ischemic stroke with common polymorphisms in ACYP2 and TSPYL6 genes in a Chinese Han population. We found that the risk alleles of six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs11125529, rs12615793, rs843711, rs11896604, and rs843706 within both ACYP2 and TSPYL6, and rs17045754 in ACYP2 gene, were related with increased risk of ischemic stroke according to both allelic and genotype association analyses. The significant correlations between ACYP2 and TSPYL6 SNPs and ischemic stroke risk were also observed in dominant, recessive, and additive models, respectively. Two blocks in high linkage disequilibrium were identified in this study, and two haplotypes were associated with higher ischemic stroke susceptibility. In conclusion, the genetic polymorphisms of ACYP2 and TSPYL6 are associated with increased risk of developing ischemic stroke. Further studies with larger sample sizes are required to validate our findings."
27525877,27525877,Association of NF-κB1 gene polymorphisms with coronary artery disease in a Han Chinese population.,"Nuclear factor (NF)-κB is a transcription factor that controls cell proliferation, differentiation, and immunity. Activated NF-κB1 is associated with the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD) and genetic polymorphisms in NF-κB1 have a plausible role in modulating the risk of CAD. To identify markers that contribute to the genetic susceptibility to CAD, we examined the potential association between CAD and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs28362491, rs230531, rs230528, rs1005819, rs4648055, rs3774964, and rs3774968) in the NF-κB1 gene using SNaPshot SNP genotyping assay. Participants included 361 patients with CAD and 385 healthy controls. The genotype and allele frequencies of the rs28362491 (promoter region) polymorphism in the CAD patients were significantly different from those in the healthy controls. The frequency of the D allele was significantly higher in CAD patients than in the healthy controls (P = 0.005 after Bonferroni correction). Strong linkage disequilibrium was observed in one block (D' > 0.9). Haplotype analysis revealed that haplotypes in block 1 of the NF-κB1 gene did not display a risk or protective effect (P > 0.05). These data suggest that NF-κB1 gene polymorphisms confer susceptibility to CAD and also support the notion that dysfunction of NF-κB1 is involved in the pathophysiological process of CAD."
27525837,27525837,Validation of associations between ESR1 variants and breast cancer risk in Chinese cohorts.,"Estrogen receptor-a (ER) protein plays a key role in breast carcinogenesis, and common genetic variants in the corresponding gene locus have been associated with breast cancer risk in different populations. Here, we analyzed estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) associations in two hospital-based studies of patients from the south of China. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs3757318, rs2046210, and rs3734805) in ESR1 were selected from previous genome-wide association study results and were genotyped using the Sequenom MassARRAY® iPLEX System in 845 breast cancer patients and 882 healthy controls. Association analysis based on unconditional logistic regression was carried out to determine the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) for each SNP. Stratified analyses according to the status of ER and progesterone receptor (PR) were also performed. Of the three SNPs, rs3757318 did not pass the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test and was excluded from the subsequent analysis. The other two SNPs (rs2046210 and rs3734805) were strongly associated with susceptibility to breast cancer. Allele T of rs2046210 and allele C of rs3734805 were risk alleles and the adjusted ORs were 1.348 (95%CI = 1.172-1.550, P = 0.0001) and 1.319 (95%CI = 1.144-1.522, P = 0.0001), respectively. Furthermore, the risk allele of rs2046210 gave negative results for ER and PR expression in an immunohistochemical test, with ORs of 0.602 (95%CI = 0.384-0.944, P = 0.027) and 0.532 (95%CI = 0.338-0.837, P = 0.006), respectively. Our study further supports associations between rs2046210 and rs3734805 and breast cancer risk in Chinese women."
27525948,27525948,Gly71Arg UGT1A1 polymorphism is associated with breast cancer susceptibility in Han Chinese women.,"Breast cancer is among the most common causes of cancer-related death in women worldwide. Previous studies have demonstrated an association between prolonged estrogen exposure and increased risk of breast cancer. Uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1 (UGT1A1) plays a significant role in the detoxification of estrogens. Two major genetic polymorphisms have been identified in the UGT1A1 locus. UGT1A1*28 has been previously linked to increased risk of breast cancer. The aim of this study was to elucidate the possible correlation between UGT1A1*6, a single nucleotide polymorphism causing a Gly71Arg substitution, and breast cancer susceptibility. Forty-six women diagnosed with breast cancer, 15 patients with gastrointestinal cancer, and 13 healthy women were recruited to this study. The genotype in the polymorphic UGT1A1 locus was determined by DNA sequencing. The frequency of each genotype was compared among the three groups. The frequency of the UGT1A1*6 allele was significantly higher in breast cancer and gastrointestinal cancer patients than that in healthy females (both P < 0.05). No significant associations were observed between the UGT1A1*6 polymorphism and estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER-2 expression status, menstrual status, or metastasis (all P > 0.05). Therefore, the UGT1A1*6 polymorphism was deduced to be a risk factor for breast cancer in women of Han Chinese ethnicity. UGT1A1 may serve as a therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer and other estrogen-related diseases."
27511600,27511600,The Associations of HLA-A*02:01 and DRB1*11:01 with Hepatitis C Virus Spontaneous Clearance Are Independent of IL28B in the Chinese Population.,"Spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) occurs in 10-40% of the infections. Specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles have been identified in associating with HCV clearance. However, data on the association of HLA with the spontaneous clearance of HCV are scarce in the Chinese population. In the current study we studied the HLA class I and class II genes in 231 Chinese voluntary blood donors who had cleared HCV infection spontaneously compared to 429 subjects with chronic HCV infections. We also studied their IL28B SNP (rs8099917) genotype, since a number of investigators have found a strong association of IL28B with spontaneous or treatment induced HCV clearance. We found that HLA-A*02:01 and DQB1*05:02 distributed differently between the two groups after Bonferroni correction (odds ratio [OR] = 1.839, Pc = 0.024 and OR = 0.547, Pc = 0.016, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested that A*02:01 and DRB1*11:01 (OR = 1.798, P = 0.008 and OR = 1.921, P = 0.005, respectively) were associated with HCV spontaneous clearance, independent of age, gender and IL28B polymorphism. We concluded that in the Chinese population, HLA-A*02:01 and DRB1*11:01 might be associated with the host capacity to clear HCV independent of IL28B, which suggesting that the innate and adaptive immune responses both play an important role in the control of HCV."

This population contains 476 inbred lines representing the major Chinese rapeseed genepool and 44 lines from other countries. The 60K Brassica Infinium® SNP array was utilized to genotype the association panel. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed via three methods, including a robust, novel, nonparametric Anderson-Darling (A-D) test. Consequently, 68 loci were identified as significantly associated with plant height (P < 5.22 × 10(-5)), and more than 70% of the loci (48) overlapped the confidence intervals of reported QTLs from nine mapping populations. Moreover, 24 GWAS loci were detected with selective sweep signals, which reflected the signatures of historical semi-dwarf breeding. In the linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay range up-and downstream of 65 loci (r (2) > 0.1), we found plausible candidates orthologous to the documented Arabidopsis genes involved in height regulation. One significant association found by GWAS colocalized with the established height locus BnRGA in rapeseed. Our results provide insights into the genetic basis of plant height in rapeseed and may facilitate marker-based breeding."
27507698,27507698,Association between MKL1 rs6001946 and schizophrenia in a Han Chinese population.,"Megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1) is highly expressed in the nervous system and plays a potentially principal role in neuronal migration and morphology. A recent study showed that some genetic loci within the MKL1 gene, especially single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6001946, may increase schizophrenia susceptibility. Here, we sought to determine whether the polymorphism rs6001946 was associated with schizophrenia in a Han Chinese population using the ligase detection reaction-polymerase chain reaction method to genotype SNP rs6001946 in the MKL1 gene. We observed that there was a marginally significant association between SNP rs6001946 and the risk of schizophrenia (P=0.077). Our results indicated that SNP rs6001946 of the MKL1 gene is likely a risk factor for schizophrenia, but the role of SNP rs6001946 in the development of schizophrenia in Han Chinese should be interpreted cautiously. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to determine the involvement of the MKL1 polymorphism in schizophrenia susceptibility."

Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the potential association between rs10811656 and the risk of CAD in a Chinese population."
27519474,27519474,TNFSF4 polymorphisms are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus in the Malaysian population.,"Tumour necrosis factor superfamily 4 (TNFSF4) gene has been reported to be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) susceptibility due to its encoding for OX40L protein that can increase autoantibody production and cause imbalance of T-cell proliferation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of TNFSF4 rs2205960, rs1234315, rs8446748 and rs704840 with SLE in the Malaysian population. A total of 476 patients with SLE and 509 healthy controls were recruited. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was applied to genotype the selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Allelic and genotypic frequencies of each SNP were calculated for each ethnic group, and association test was performed using logistic regression. The overall association of each SNP in Malaysian patients with SLE was determined with meta-analysis. The frequency of minor T allele of TNFSF4 rs2205960 was significant in Chinese and Indian patients with SLE, with P values of 0.05 (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.00-1.61) and 0.004 (OR = 3.16, 95% CI: 1.41-7.05), respectively. Significant association of minor G allele of rs704840 with SLE was also observed in Chinese (P = 0.03, OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.02-1.56). However, after Bonferroni correction, only T allele of rs2205960 remained significantly associated with Indian cohort. Overall, minor G allele of rs704840 showed significant association with SLE in the Malaysian population with P values of 0.05 (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.00-1.43). We suggested TNFSF4 rs704840 could be the potential SLE risk factors in the Malaysian population."
27506295,27506295,Epidermal growth factor gene is a newly identified candidate gene for gout.,"Chromosome 4q25 has been identified as a genomic region associated with gout. However, the associations of gout with the genes in this region have not yet been confirmed. Here, we performed two-stage analysis to determine whether variations in candidate genes in the 4q25 region are associated with gout in a male Chinese Han population. We first evaluated 96 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight inflammatory/immune pathway- or glucose/lipid metabolism-related genes in the 4q25 region in 480 male gout patients and 480 controls. The SNP rs12504538, located in the elongation of very-long-chain-fatty-acid-like family member 6 gene (Elovl6), was found to be associated with gout susceptibility (Padjusted = 0.00595). In the second stage of analysis, we performed fine mapping analysis of 93 tag SNPs in Elovl6 and in the epidermal growth factor gene (EGF) and its flanking regions in 1017 male patients gout and 1897 healthy male controls. We observed a significant association between the T allele of EGF rs2298999 and gout (odds ratio = 0.77, 95% confidence interval = 0.67-0.88, Padjusted = 6.42 × 10(-3)). These results provide the first evidence for an association between the EGF rs2298999 C/T polymorphism and gout. Our findings should be validated in additional populations."

It ten times more dominantly affects women than men with an onset peak at menopause. The genetic factor predisposing women to PSS remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to identify susceptibility loci for PSS in women. We performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 242 female PSS patients and 1444 female control in Han Chinese population residing in Taiwan. Replication was conducted in an independent cohort of 178 female PSS and 14,432 control subjects. We identified rs117026326 on GTF2I with GWAS significance (P = 1.10 × 10"
27506219,27506219,Pooling-Based Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Risk Loci in the Pathogenesis of Ovarian Endometrioma in Chinese Han Women.,"Endometriosis, regarded as a complex disease, is influenced by multiple genetic factors. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in endometriosis have identified several susceptibility loci in Caucasian and Japanese populations. However, the overlapped susceptible loci were few. This case-control study tried to identify risk loci-related genes for ovarian endometrioma in Chinese Han women from central China using DNA pooling-based GWAS. Genome DNA samples were extracted from 3038 participants in central China. Pooling-based genome-wide scan and individual genotyping were performed using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 and IPLEX Gold system, which demonstrated 10 ovarian endometrioma-related novel risk loci. There were 3 of them with P value < 5 × 10"
27489354,27489354,Association of the GLB1 rs4678680 genetic variant with risk of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Accumulated evidences demonstrated that GLB1 is involved in cell senescence and cancer development. The GLB1 rs4678680 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been identified as a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) susceptibility polymorphism by a genome-wide association study in Korean population previously. However, little or nothing was known about its involvement and functional significance in hepatitis B viruses (HBV)-related HCC in Chinese. Therefore, we investigated the association between the GLB1 rs4678680 SNP and HBV-related HCC risk as well as its biological function in vivo. Genotypes were determined in two independent case-control sets from two medical centers of China. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by logistic regression. The potential regulation role the rs4678680 genetic variant on GLB1 expression was examined with HCC and normal liver tissues. We found that The rs4678680 G allele was showed to be risk allele; individuals with the TG genotype had an OR of 1.51 (95% CI = 1.10-2.07, P = 0.010, Shandong set) or 1.49 (95% CI = 1.11-1.99, P = 0.008, Jiangsu set) for developing HBV-related HCC, respectively, compared with individuals with the TT genotype. This association was more pronounced in males, individuals aged older than 57 years and drinkers (all P < 0.05). In the genotype-phenotype correlation analyses of fifty-six human liver tissue samples, rs4678680 TG or GG was associated with a statistically significant increase of GLB1 mRNA expression (P < 0.05). Our data indicated that the GLB1 rs4678680 SNP contributes to susceptibility to develop HBV-related HCC, highlighting the involvement of GLB1 and cell senescence in etiology of HCC."
27494404,27494404,HDAC9 Variant Rs2107595 Modifies Susceptibility to Coronary Artery Disease and the Severity of Coronary Atherosclerosis in a Chinese Han Population.,"A previous genome-wide association study showed that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2107595 in histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) gene was associated with large artery stroke (LAS) in Caucasians. Based on the similar atherosclerotic pathogenesis between LAS and coronary artery disease (CAD), we aimed to evaluate the associations of SNP rs2107595 with CAD risk and the severity of coronary atherosclerosis in a Chinese Han population, and explore the potential gene-environment interactions among SNP rs2107595 and conventional CAD risk factors. In a two-stage case-control study with a total of 2317 CAD patients and 2404 controls, the AG + AA genotypes of SNP rs2107595 were significantly associated with increased CAD risk (Adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.23, Padj = 0.001) and higher modified Gensini scores (Adjusted OR = 1.38, Padj < 0.001). These associations remained significant in subtype analyses for unstable angina pectoris (UAP), non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Subgroup and multifactor dimensionality reduction analyses (MDR) further found the gene-environment interactions among SNP rs2107595, body mass index, type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia in CAD risk and the severity of coronary atherosclerosis. Moreover, patients with CAD had higher levels of HDAC9 mRNA expression and plasma HDAC9 than controls. Subsequent genotype-phenotype analyses observed the significant correlations of SNP rs2107595 with HDAC9 mRNA expression and plasma HDAC9 levels in controls and patients with NSTEMI and STEMI. Taken together, our data suggest that SNP rs2107595 may contribute to coronary atherosclerosis and CAD risk through a possible mechanism of regulating HDAC9 expression and gene-environment interactions."
27488260,27488260,"Dietary choline and betaine intake, choline-metabolising genetic polymorphisms and breast cancer risk: a case-control study in China.","Choline and betaine are essential nutrients involved in one-carbon metabolism and have been hypothesised to affect breast cancer risk. Functional polymorphisms in genes encoding choline-related one-carbon metabolism enzymes, including phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT), choline dehydrogenase (CHDH) and betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), have important roles in choline metabolism and may thus interact with dietary choline and betaine intake to modify breast cancer risk. This study aimed to investigate the interactive effect of polymorphisms in PEMT, BHMT and CHDH genes with choline/betaine intake on breast cancer risk among Chinese women. This hospital-based case-control study consecutively recruited 570 cases with histologically confirmed breast cancer and 576 age-matched (5-year interval) controls. Choline and betaine intakes were assessed by a validated FFQ, and genotyping was conducted for PEMT rs7946, CHDH rs9001 and BHMT rs3733890. OR and 95 % CI were estimated using unconditional logistic regression. Compared with the highest quartile of choline intake, the lowest intake quartile showed a significant increased risk of breast cancer. The SNP PEMT rs7946, CHDH rs9001 and BHMT rs3733890 had no overall association with breast cancer, but a significant risk reduction was observed among postmenopausal women with AA genotype of BHMT rs3733890 (OR 0·49; 95 % CI 0·25, 0·98). Significant interactions were observed between choline intake and SNP PEMT rs7946 (P interaction=0·029) and BHMT rs3733890 (P interaction=0·006) in relation to breast cancer risk. Our results suggest that SNP PEMT rs7946 and BHMT rs3733890 may interact with choline intake on breast cancer risk."

Genome-wide association studies have linked the PR interval with several common variants in the TBX5 gene. Several variants in the TBX5 gene, including rs7312625 and rs883079, have been associated with AF. The purpose of this study was to determine the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TBX5 gene, rs7312625 and rs883079, with AF in Chinese Han patients."
27506496,27506496,A Functional Polymorphism (rs937283) in the MDM2 Promoter Region is Associated with Poor Prognosis of Retinoblastoma in Chinese Han Population.,"The effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at MDM2 has been investigated in several cancer types. Three MDM2 SNPs(rs937283, rs2270744 and rs769412) have previously been suggested to be positively correlated with cancer. In this study, we aimed to explore the association of rs937283, rs2270744 and rs769412 polymorphisms with retinoblastoma (RB) risk, clinicopathological characteristics, and prognosis. Compared with wild-type genotype AA at rs937283, individuals carrying AG and GG genotype had a significantly increased risk for developing RB (OR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.13-3.08; OR = 2.48, 95% CI 1.10-5.62, respectively). RB patients with allele G at rs937283 were more susceptible to invasion and high tumor aggression (OR = 2.42, 95% CI 1.43-4.11; OR = 2.15, 95% CI 1.27-3.64, respectively). Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank results revealed that RB patients harboring genotype GG and G allele at rs937283 had worse survival (P < 0.02 and P < 0.01, respectively). In addition, the A to G substitution at rs937283 significantly enhanced the transcription activity of the MDM2 gene in vitro. In vivo, we found that MDM2 mRNA and protein were overexpressed in individuals who carried the G allele at rs937283. This study suggested that the MDM2 rs937283 polymorphism is a novel functional SNP both in vitro and in vivo as well as a biomarker for poor prognosis in RB."
27488752,27488752,The rs6817105 polymorphism on chromosome 4q25 is associated with the risk of atrial fibrillation in the Chinese Han population.,Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified rs6817105-a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on chromosome 4q25-to be associated with the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) in a European-descent population.

27561898,27561898,TERT rs2736100 genotypes are associated with differential risk of myeloproliferative neoplasms in Swedish and Chinese male patient populations.,"The telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene rs2736100_C allele has recently been shown to be associated with an increased risk for myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) among Caucasians. However, it is unknown if this association is present in other ethnical populations and whether rs2736100 allele frequencies mirror the incidence of MPNs in a population. Here we genotyped TERT rs2736100 variants in 126 Swedish and 101 Chinese MPN patients and their age-, sex-, and ethnically-matched healthy controls. Healthy Chinese adults had a higher frequency of the A allele and lower frequencies of the C allele compared to Swedish counterparts (57.4 vs 47.0 % for A, 42.6 vs 53.0 % for C, P = 0.006). Both Swedish and Chinese patients harbored significantly higher C allele frequency than their controls (62.7 vs 53.0 % and 57.4 vs 42.6 % for Swedish and Chinese, respectively, P = 0.004). Swedes and Chinese bearing the CC genotype had a significantly increased risk of MPN compared to AA carriers (OR = 2.47; 95 % CI: 1.33-4.57, P = 0.003, for Swedes, and OR = 3.45; 95 % CI: 1.52-7.85, P = 0.005, for Chinese). Further analyses showed that rs2736100_CC was associated with robustly enhanced risk in males only (CC vs AA, OR = 5.11; 95 % CI: 2.19-11.92, P < 0.0001). The CC-carrying MPN patients exhibited significantly higher TERT expression than patients with the AC genotype. Collectively, the rs2736100_C is a risk allele for MPNs in Swedish and Chinese males, and the lower incidence of MPNs in the Chinese population is correlated with a lower rs2736100_C risk allele frequency."
27473603,27473603,A GWA study reveals genetic loci for body conformation traits in Chinese Laiwu pigs and its implications for human BMI.,"Pigs share numerous physiological and phenotypic similarities with human and thus have been considered as a good model in nonrodent mammals for the study of genetic basis of human obesity. Researches on candidate genes for obesity traits have successfully identified some common genes between humans and pigs. However, few studies have assessed how many similarities exist between the genetic architecture of obesity in pigs and humans by large-scale comparative genomics. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the porcine 60 K SNP Beadchip for BMI and other four conformation traits at three different ages in a Chinese Laiwu pig population, which shows a large variability in fat deposition. In total, 35 SNPs were found to be significant at Bonferroni-corrected 5 % chromosome-wise level (P = 2.13 × 10"
27462996,27462996,An efficient method to genotype the polymorphisms of cholinergic nicotinic receptor subunit genes and their associations with COPD onset risk.,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the cholinergic nicotinic receptor subunit genes on chromosome 15q25.1, including CHRNA3, CHRNB4 and CHRNA5, are well-established biomarkers of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer.

27467165,27467165,Association of Long Non-Coding RNA HOTAIR Polymorphisms with Cervical Cancer Risk in a Chinese Population.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), HOTAIR has been reported to be upregulated in cervical cancer development and progression. However, SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in the lncRNAs and their associations with cervical cancer susceptibility have not been reported. In the current study, we hypothesized that SNPs within the lncRNA HOTAIR may influence the risk of cervical cancer. We performed a case-control study including 510 cervical cancer patients (cases) and 713 cancer-free individuals (controls) to investigate the association between three haplotype-tagging SNPs (rs920778, rs1899663 and rs4759314) in the lncRNA HOTAIR and the risk of cervical cancer. We found a strong association between the SNP rs920778 in the intronic enhancer of the HOTAIR and cervical cancer (P<10-4). Moreover, the cervical cancer patients with homozygous TT genotype were significantly associated with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. In vitro assays with allele-specific reporter constructs indicated that the reporter constructs bearing rs920778T allele conferred elevated reporter gene transcriptional activity when compared to the reporter constructs containing rs920778C allele. Furthermore, HOTAIR expression was higher in cervical cancer tissues than that in corresponding normal tissues, and the high expression was associated with the risk-associated allele T. In summary, our studies provide strong functional evidence that functional SNP rs920778 regulates HOTAIR expression, and may ultimately influence the predisposition for cervical cancer."
27461153,27461153,Variants in 9p21 Predicts Severity of Coronary Artery Disease in a Chinese Han Population.,"Recent genome-wide association studies identified the common genetic variants in 9p21 were associated with the coronary artery disease (CAD). However, whether this locus could predict the severity of CAD in Chinese Han population is unclear. 499 CAD patients who underwent coronary angiography (CAG) have been enrolled for this study. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs2383207 and rs2383206 in 9p21 were genotyped in 499 CAG cases and 1519 controls in Chinese Han population. The gene dosage of 9p21 was stratified by the degree of vascular lesions and tested for association with the severity of CAD. Rs2383207 and rs2383206 demonstrated significant associations with 2-vessel and 3-vessel disease (P = 2.0×10(-3) and 1.9×10(-4) , respectively). GG genotypes of rs2383206 occurred higher proportion of left main trunk (LM) disease (P = 6.0×10(-3) ). GG genotypes of rs2383207 occurred higher proportion of left anterior descending artery disease (LAD) and right CAD (RCA) (P = 2.7×10(-6) and 1.6×10(-4) , respectively). The risk allele G of rs2383207 was associated with severity of CAD estimated by the Gensini score (P = 3.6×10(-5) ). Rs2383207 may strongly influence the development of CAD in Chinese Han population. The gene dosage in 9p21 could predict the severity of CAD."
27466295,27466295,High-resolution Melting PCR Analysis for Genotyping Lys109Arg and Gln223Arg in Patients with Renal Cell Carcinoma.,"Although several studies have documented the role of leptin receptor gene polymorphisms in cancers, the association between leptin receptor gene polymorphisms and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains unknown. The aim of this study was to develop a high-resolution melting (HRM) approach for genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms of leptin receptor gene on the LightCycler 480, and to explore the relation between polymorphisms of the leptin receptor gene and RCC. The study population consisted of 83 patients with renal cell carcinoma and 161 healthy control subjects. The Lys109Arg (A/G) and Gln223Arg (A/G) polymorphisms of leptin receptor gene were examined with HRM assay. Direct DNA sequencing and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphisms were used as a reference method for genotyping Lys109Arg and Gln223Arg, respectively. Three genotypes of Lys109Arg or Gln223Arg were clearly distinguishable from the melting curve shapes with HRM assay. The data also showed the results of the direct DNA sequencing or PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphisms analysis were in complete concordance to genotyping results obtained by HRM (kappa=1.0). In addition, the data showed the G-G haplotype frequency was higher (p<0.05), and that the A-G (p<0.001) and G-A (p<0.01) haplotypes frequencies were lower in the RCC than controls. We developed a rapid, low cost, high-throughput and reliable single-tube technology for genotyping Lys109Arg and Gln223Arg polymorphisms. In addition, our data suggest that Lys109Arg and Gln223Arg gene polymorphisms are associated with RCC in Chinese Han studied population."
27460564,27460564,Association study of C-reactive protein associated gene HNF1A with ischemic stroke in Chinese population.,"Ischemic stroke is a life-threatening condition due to obstructed blood supply of the brain. Elevation of plasma C-reactive protein, an important inflammatory marker, was known to associate with increased risk of ischemic stroke. Previous studies reported association between genetic variants of HNF1A and plasma level of C-reactive protein. The HNF1A gene encodes a hepatocyte transcription factor which might have regulatory effects on C-reactive protein synthesis in liver. Therefore, the C-reactive protein associated gene HNF1A seems to be a promising candidate gene for ischemic stroke."
27458158,27458158,Association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in the TSPYL6 gene and breast cancer susceptibility in the Han Chinese population.,"We investigated the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the testis-specific Y-encoded-like protein 6 (TSPYL6) gene and breast cancer (BC) susceptibility in the Han Chinese population. A total of 183 BC patients and 195 healthy women were included in the study. Six SNPs in TSPYL6 were genotyped and the association with BC risk analyzed. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify SNPs that correlated with BC susceptibility. Rs11896604 was associated with a decreased risk of BC based on dominant and genotype models. Rs843706 was associated with an increased risk of BC based on a recessive model. Rs11125529 was associated with decreased BC susceptibility based on a genotype model. Finally, rs843711 inversely correlated with clinical stage III/IV BC. Our findings reveal a significant association between SNPs in the TSPYL6 gene and BC risk in a Han Chinese population."

27449905,27449905,The association of novel IL-33 polymorphisms with sIL-33 and risk of systemic lupus erythematosus.,"The serum level of IL-33 was upregulated in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which may be used as biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets for SLE. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of four novel polymorphisms of IL-33 with risk of SLE. The study population comprised 540 Chinese individuals, including 257subjects with SLE and 283 healthy controls. The gene polymorphism was measured using Snapshot SNP genotyping assays and confirmed by sequencing. Serum IL-33 (sIL-33) levels were measured by ELISA. The serum SLE levels were significantly higher in the group of patients with SLE than those in the control group (P<0.001). The rs1891385C allele was associated with a significantly increased risk of SLE as compared with the rs1891385 A allele (OR=1.405, 95% CI, 1.052-1.875, P=0.021). The C-T-T-G haplotype was significantly increased the risk of SLE (OR=1.411; 95% CI, 1.021-1.948; P=0.036). IL-33 gene rs1891385 polymorphism was significantly associated with the expression of sIL-33 in the SLE patients. Besides, in our study, we found that the unregulated sIL-33 level was significantly associated with the abnormal changed CRP and ESR. This is the first study reporting the IL-33 gene polymorphisms and SLE, which may help refine the SLE risk profile."

The delta-like 3 (DLL3) gene, a member of the Notch signaling pathway, was implicated to contribute to human CS. In this study, a case-control association study was conducted to determine the association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the DLL3 gene with CS in a Chinese Han Population. Five known tagging SNPs of the DLL3 gene were genotyped among 270 Chinese Han subjects (128 nonsyndromic CS patients and 142 matched controls). CS patients were divided into 3 types: type I-failure of formation (29 cases), type II-failure of segmentation (50 cases), and type III-mixed defects (49 cases). The 5 SNPs were analyzed by the allelic and genotypic association analysis, genotype-phenotype association analysis, and haplotype analysis. Allele frequencies of 5 tagging SNPs (SNP1: rs1110627, SNP2: rs3212276, SNP3: rs2304223, SNP4: rs2304222, and SNP5: rs2304214) in CS cases and controls were comparable and there were no available inheritance models. The SNPs were not associated with clinical phenotypes. Moreover, the 5 makers in the DLL3 gene were found to be in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD). Both global haplotype and individual haplotype analyses showed that the haplotypes of SNP1/SNP2/SNP3/SNP4/SNP5 did not correlate with the disease (P >0.05). Together, these data suggest that genetic variants of the DLL3 gene are not associated with CS in the Chinese Han population."

We aimed to examine the roles of STAT4 polymorphisms on HBV-related liver diseases in a Chinese Han population. We selected 13 SNPs in STAT4 based on the HapMap database to investigate their associations in 3,033 participants. SNP rs7574865 was significantly associated with HBV infection [odds ratio (OR) 1.15; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.00, 1.31; P = 0.046] and clearance (OR 1.17; 95 % CI 1.02, 1.33; P = 0.028). Further, haplotype-based association analysis indicated that the haplotype CTCTT, formed by SNPs rs8179673, rs7574865, rs4274624, rs11889341, and rs10168266, was significantly associated with HBV infection (OR 0.87; 95 % CI 0.76, 0.99; P = 0.022) and clearance (OR 0.86; 95 % CI 0.75, 0.99; P = 0.018).

27437086,27437086,Allele Frequencies of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms Related to the Body Burden of Heavy Metals in the Korean Population and Their Ethnic Differences.,"This study was performed to select single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to the body burden of heavy metals in Koreans, to provide Korean allele frequencies of selected SNPs, and to assess the difference in allele frequencies with other ethnicities. The candidate-gene approach method and genome-wide association screening were used to select SNPs related to the body burden of heavy metals. Genotyping analysis of the final 192 SNPs selected was performed on 1,483 subjects using the VeraCode Goldengate assay. Allele frequencies differences and genetic differentiations between the Korean population and Chinese (CHB), Japanese (JPT), Caucasian (CEU), and African (YIR) populations were tested by Fisher's exact test and fixation index (F ST), respectively. The Korean population was genetically similar to the CHB and JPT populations (F ST < 0.05, for all SNPs in both populations). However, a significant difference in the allele frequencies between the Korean and CEU and YIR populations were observed in 99 SNPs (60.7%) and 120 SNPs (73.6%), respectively. Ten (6.1%) and 26 (16.0%) SNPs had genetic differentiation (F ST > 0.05) among the Korean-CEU and Korean-YIR comparisons, respectively. The SNP with the largest F ST value between the Korean and African populations was cystathionine-β-synthase rs234709 (F ST: KOR-YIR, 0.309; KOR-CEU, 0.064). Our study suggests that interethnic differences exist in SNPs associated with heavy metals of Koreans, and it should be considered in future studies that address ethnic differences in heavy-metal concentrations in the body and genetic susceptibility to the body burden of heavy metals."

The rs11473 polymorphism was genotyped in 624 esophageal cancer patients and 636 cancer-free age- and gender-matched controls using polymerase chain reaction restriction and direct sequencing. The functional variants resulting from the BSG rs11473 SNP were investigated using a luciferase activity assay and validated by immunoblotting. We discovered that ESCC patients carrying the rs11473 AA genotype or A allele were at a significantly higher risk of esophageal cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 1.560, 95% confidence interval  (CI) = 1.031-2.358, P = 0.037; OR = 1.231, 95%CI = 1.038-1.459, P = 0.017, respectively] than those carrying the GG genotype and G allele. Moreover, the rs11473 polymorphism modifies the binding of miR-483- 5p to basigin, as well as the basigin protein levels in esophageal cancer patients. Our data suggested that the rs11473 polymorphism at the miR- 483-5p binding site in the 3'-UTR of basigin gene may play a key role in the development of esophageal cancer in a Chinese population."
27421004,27421004,Association of genetic variations in the ACLY gene with growth traits in Chinese beef cattle.,"ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) is the primary enzyme responsible for the synthesis of cytosolic acetyl-CoA, which is a key precursor of both fatty acid and mevalonate synthesis pathways. Genetic variation of the ACLY gene may influence multiple traits associated with animal production. Here, we identified three non-synonymous mutations in ACLY exons in five beef cattle populations using DNA pool sequencing and high-resolution melting analysis. Results from association analyses revealed that the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) g.17127C>T is significantly associated with chest girth (P < 0.01) and body height (P < 0.05) in the Fleckvieh x Zhangye local crossbred cattle, and with body slanting length (P < 0.05) in the Simmental x Guyuan local crossbred cattle. SNP g.40427T>C is significantly associated with an increase in chest girth (P < 0.05) in the Simmental x Huzhu cattle population. These results provide preliminary evidence that polymorphisms in the bovine ACLY gene are associated with growth traits in beef cattle in northwest China. However, a larger sample set is needed to validate these findings."

27412944,27412944,[Correlation between the genetic polymorphisms of apolipoprotein M with the susceptibility to rheumatic diseases of Chinese Han populastion in Lanzhou].,"Objective To investigate the relationship between the genetic polymorphisms of apolipoprotein M (ApoM) and the susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) among Chinese Han population in Lanzhou. Methods Primers for the two single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites (rs805296 and rs805297) in ApoM gene were designed and their genotyping methods of polymerase chain reaction-high resolution melting (PCR-HRM) assay were established. Case-control studies were performed among the 599 cases of RA, 194 cases of SLE, 179 cases of AS and 273 matched healthy controls to analyze the correlations between the two SNPs and the susceptibility to rheumatic diseases. Results The genotype frequencies of rs805296 were AA 87.0%, AG 12.7%, GG 0.3% in RA cases, AA 84.5%, AG 15.0%, GG 0.5% in SLE cases, AA 91.6%, AG 7.3%, GG 1.1% in AS cases, AA 85.0%, AG 15.0%, GG 0% in healthy controls. The ones of rs805297 were GG 38.2%, GT 51.8%, TT 10.0% in RA cases, GG 44.3%, GT 45.4%, TT 10.3% in SLE cases, GG 37.4%, GT 47.5%, TT 15.1% in AS cases, GG 40.7%, GT 46.1%, TT 13.2% in healthy controls. Statistical analyses showed that only the genotype distribution of rs805296 was significantly different between the AS cases and the healthy controls. Under the dominant model, the G allele carriers of rs805296 (AG heterozygote and GG homozygote) were found to significantly decrease the risk for AS development. Conclusion The established PCR-HRM genotyping assays in the present study can successfully achieve the molecular diagnosis of the two SNPs sites (rs805296 and rs805297) from clinical samples, and the study found a significant association between the SNP of rs805296 and the susceptibility to AS among Chinese Han population in Lanzhou."

Genetic factors are thought to be crucial in the pathogenesis of AS. However, few data are available on the relationship between HLA-DP/DQ and STAT4 polymorphisms and AS susceptibility in the Chinese population. Therefore, we examined HLA-DP/DQ and STAT4 polymorphisms (rs3077, rs9277535, rs7453920 and rs7574865) in a total of 779 subjects, including 400 AS and 379 age- and sex-matched healthy controls in Chinese. No significant difference was observed between AS patients and healthy controls in the allele frequency of rs3077, rs9277535 and rs7574865. However, there was a significant association between the HLA-DQ rs7453920 G/A variant and AS patients, with minor allele A correlated with a reduced risk of AS (allelic frequency, adjusted OR=0.66, 95% CI=0.55-0.78, p=4.0E-06; dominant model, adjusted OR=0.75, 95% CI=0.66-0.85, p=1.1E-05). Moreover, the haplotypes block AAA and GGA in the HLA gene significantly correlated with reduced risk of AS. This is the first study demonstrating the significant associations of SNP rs7453920 and the haplotypes in the HLA gene with the risk of AS in Southwest Chinese population. This research sheds new light on the significant relationship between HLA polymorphisms and AS."
27379158,27379158,Association of a SNP in SLC35F3 Gene with the Risk of Hypertension in a Chinese Han Population.,"A recent study suggested that SLC35F3 which encoded a thiamine transporter was a new candidate gene for hypertension. The goal of this study was to investigate the association between the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SLC35F3 gene and hypertension in a Chinese population. Sanger sequencing was performed in 93 samples to find SNPs in coding regions and intron-exon boundaries in the SLC35F3 gene. We found eight genetic variants in the coding regions of SLC35F3 and subsequently genotyped a non-synonymous variant rs34032258 (C > G) in 1060 hypertension patients and 1467 controls. After adjusting for age and gender, multivariate analysis of covariance showed that the variant was associated with hypertensive traits. In detail, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 8 mmHg higher, blood urea nitrogen was 12 mmol/L higher, and creatinine was 15 mmol/L lower in G/G group compared with C/C group (p = 0.007; 0.012 and 0.029, respectively). Further study suggested that C/G+G/G had higher DBP than C/C genotype in those whose DBP ≥ 90 mmHg (98.02 mmHg vs. 94.04 mmHg, p = 0.021). No significant difference has been found in systolic blood pressure between different genotypes. Additionally, in the subgroup of obesity, allele distribution of this variant has shown significant difference between hypertensive patients and normotensive controls (p = 0.018). In conclusion, we found that the rs34032258 in the SLC35F3 gene was associated with high blood pressure and may increase the risk of hypertension. The new hypertension-susceptibility locus may involve in the pathogenesis of hypertension and indicate some novel treatment implications."

A total of 1162 subjects (612 men and 550 women), with a mean age of 63.1 ± 12.5 years old, were selected, including 580 IS patients and 582 normal controls. Logistic regression was performed to investigate association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and IS risk, and generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) was used to analyze the gene-gene interaction. Logistic regression analysis showed that the frequency for rs4646903 minor alleles was lower in cases than that in normal controls, and C allele of rs4646903 was 20.7 % in ischemic stroke cases and 27.1 % in controls subjects (p < 0.001). Logistic analysis showed the significant association between genotypes of variants in rs4646903 and decreased ischemic stroke risk. GMDR analysis indicated that there was a significant two-locus model (p = 0.0107) involving rs4646903 and rs1048943, indicating a potential gene-gene interaction between rs4646903 and rs1048943. Overall, the two- locus models had a cross-validation consistency of 9 of 10, and had the testing accuracy of 60.72 %. Subjects with TC or CC of rs4646903 and AG or GG of rs1048943 genotype have lowest ischemic stroke risk, compared to subjects with TT of rs4646903 and AA of rs1048943 genotype, and OR (95 % CI) was 0.63 (0.42-0.89). rs4646903 minor alleles and interaction between rs4646903 and rs1048943 were associated with decreased IS risk."

Peripheral blood DNA samples were collected, DNA sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) performed, followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. In comparison to LOX473GG genotype carriers, individuals with LOX473AA exhibited a higher susceptibility to lung, colon-rectum, colon, and rectum cancers with OR values amounting to 3.84-, 2.74-, 2.75-, and 2.74-fold of the control, respectively. In the LOX 473AA-positive population, females were more susceptible than males to carcinogenesis with OR values (female vs. male): 5.25 vs. 3.23, 2.29 vs. 1.51, 2.27 vs. 1.45, and 2.25 vs. 1.53, respectively, for lung, colon-rectum combined, colon, and rectum cancers. LOX G473A polymorphism apparently elevated human sensitivity to cigarette smoking carcinogens for eliciting cancers in the lung and colon only.

We aimed to assess the genetic association between non-HLA genes and T1D in a Chinese case-control cohort recruited from multiple centers consisting of 364 patients with T1D and 719 unrelated healthy children. We genotyped 55 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) markers located in 16 non-HLA genes (VTCN1, PTPN22, CTLA4, SUMO4, CD274, IL2RA, INS, DHCR7, ERBB3, VDR, CYP27B1, CD69, CD276, PTPN2, UBASH3A, and IL2RB) using SNaPshot multiple single-base extension methods. After multivariate analysis and correction for multiple comparisons, we identified the SNP rs2292239 in ERBB3 gene were significantly associated with T1D. The frequency of the major G allele was significantly decreased in patients with T1D (68.8% in T1D vs 77.3% in controls, OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.79, P = 0.02), and the minor allele T was associated with an increased risk of T1D (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.26-1.90, P = 0.02). Our haplotype analysis confirmed that rs2292239 was the primary T1D association locus in our current investigation.

Our results indicated that the IL-3 rs2073506 G/A, IL-3 rs40401 C/T, and IL-13 rs1800925 C/T polymorphisms were not associated with RA. However, stratification analyses suggested that the IL-13 rs1800925 CT and CT/CC genotypes increased the risk of RA in patients with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) <25.00. To sum up, these findings suggest that the IL-13 rs1800925 C/T polymorphism may be associated with increased risk of RA in ESR <25.00 patients.

27323013,27323013,Relationship between the polymorphisms in KCNQ1 and type 2 diabetes in Chinese Kazakh population.,"Recently genome-wide association studies on East Asian populations reported an association between diabetes and several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 40-kb linkage disequilibrium block in intron 15 of KCNQ1. However, the association between KCNQ1 variants and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Chinese Kazakh populations is unknown. We investigated the relationship between rs2237892 and rs2237895 SNPs in KCNQ1 and susceptibility to and clinical characteristics of T2DM in 100 Chinese Kazakh T2DM subjects and 100 healthy subjects. SNPs were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and the main anthropometric and biochemical parameters of individuals were assessed in the genotype groups (rs2237892: CC, CT, or TT, and rs2237895: AA, AC, or CC). Genotype distribution and allele frequencies of these two SNPs were not significantly different between T2DM and control groups (P > 0.05). The frequencies of CT and TT genotypes and T allele for the rs2237892 SNP in females with T2DM were significantly higher than that in the control group (genotype: P = 0.016, allele: P = 0.004). However, there were no significant differences among individuals with different genotypes with respect to the rs2237895 SNP (P > 0.05). The main anthropometric and biochemical parameters did not correlate with the rs2237892 or rs2237895 SNPs in the T2DM group (P > 0.05). Thus, the T allele-containing genotypes of the rs2237892 SNP in KCNQ1 may increase the susceptibility to T2DM in female Chinese Kazakh individuals, whereas the rs2237895 SNP may not be associated with T2DM in the Chinese Kazakh population."

In this study, we determined whether a polymorphism at the miR-214 binding site in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) is associated with susceptibility to ESCC. A total of 448 ESCC cases and 460 gender- and age-matched subjects were recruited for the study. The genotypes of the rs114673809 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) were determined by polymerase chain reaction sequencing. Associations between genotypes of MTHFR rs114673809 and ESCC risk were determined using logistic regression analyses. In the recessive model, when the MTHFR rs114673809 GG homozygote genotype was used as the reference group, the GA genotype was not associated with the risk of ESCC (GA vs GG: OR = 1.261, 95%CI = 0.960-1.657, P = 0.110), but the AA genotype was associated with increased risk of ECSS (AA vs GG: OR = 1.752, 95%CI = 1.076-2.853, P = 0.027). Additionally, the rs114673809 A allele carriers also showed a 1.286-fold increased ESCC risk compared with those carrying the rs114673809 G allele genotype. Furthermore, we observed a significant increase in plasma homocysteine levels in ESCC cases carrying the AA genotype relative to ESCC cases carrying the GG genotype. Our data demonstrate that a polymorphism at the miR-214 binding site in the 3'-UTR of MTHFR is an ESCC susceptibility SNP in the Chinese population."
27323143,27323143,Correlation between polymorphisms in the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1 and susceptibility to asthma in a Chinese population from the Henan Province.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the association between four single nucleotide polymorphisms in NR3C1 (Tth111I, BclI, ER22/23EK, and N363S), which encode the glucocorticoid receptor, and asthma susceptibility in patients from the Henan Province of China. Three hundred and twenty-eight patients with asthma and 60 healthy volunteers were recruited to this study. The target SNPs were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-high resolution melting and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The frequencies of the AA (8.84%) and GG (30.79%) genotypes of Tth111I were higher, and that of the AG genotype was lower (60.37%), in the asthma patients compared to that seen in healthy controls (5.00, 26.67, and 68.33%, respectively). On the other hand, asthma patients showed higher frequencies of the AA genotype (78.05%) of N363S, and lower frequencies of the AG and GG genotypes (15.55 and 6.40%), compared to healthy volunteers (71.67, 18.33, and 10.00%, respectively). Neither of these differences were found to be statistically significant. Moreover, we observed no significant differences in the genotype or allele frequencies of the BclI and ER22/23EK SNPs between the patient and control groups. In conclusion, SNPs in NR3C1 were not significantly associated with asthma in patients from the Henan Province. Patients showed higher frequencies of the AA and GG genotypes of Tth111I and the AA genotype of the N363S SNP compared to healthy volunteers, although these differences were not significant."
27323016,27323016,Association between matrix metalloproteinase-9 rs3918242 polymorphism and development of coronary artery disease in a Chinese population.,"We conducted a case-control study to investigate the role of one single nucleotide polymorphism of MMP-9 rs3918242 in the development of coronary artery disease. The rs3918242 was amplified with 435-bp DNA fragments using polymerase chain reaction coupled with restriction fragment length polymorphism. When compared with control subjects, patients with coronary artery disease had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as higher triglycerides (P < 0.05), were more likely to suffer from diabetes mellitus, and had lower total cholesterol and high-density lipopolysaccharides. Using unconditional logistic analysis, we found that individuals with CT and TT genotypes were associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease in a co-dominant model, and the ORs (95%CI) were 1.50 (1.02-2.20) and 6.89 (2.51-23.41) for CT and TT, respectively. We observed that the T allele of rs3918242 was correlated with increased risk of coronary artery disease (OR = 1.88, 95%CI = 1.39-2.55). In conclusion, we suggest that the TT and CT genotypes and T allele of MMP-9 rs3918242 polymorphism is correlated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease in a Chinese population."
27329975,27329975,"Association of vitamin D receptor gene TaqI, BsmI, FokI and ApaI polymorphisms and susceptibility to extremity chronic osteomyelitis in Chinese population.","Previous studies have indicated that vitamin D receptor (VDR) TaqI, BsmI, FokI and ApaI gene polymorphisms are associated with the risk of several inflammatory diseases. However, potential association of the VDR gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to extremity chronic osteomyelitis remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate link between VDR gene polymorphisms and the risk of extremity chronic osteomyelitis in Chinese population. A total of 233 patients with chronic osteomyelitis and 200 healthy controls were genotyped for the 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (TaqI, BsmI, FokI and ApaI) in VDR gene using the SNaPshot genotyping method. The frequencies of mutant allele C in rs731236 (P=0.044, OR=1.830, 95% CI 1.009 - 3.319) and rs2228570 (P=0.029, OR=1.347, 95% CI 1.031 - 1.761) were significantly higher in patients than those in healthy controls. In addition, outcomes of the logistic regression analysis adjusted by gender and age revealed that significant links were found between rs731236 (P=0.05, OR=1.887, 95% CI 1.001 - 3.558), rs2228570 (P=0.042, OR=1.594, 95% CI 1.016-2.500) and the risk of developing chronic osteomyelitis by dominant genetic model. In addition, significant association was also found between rs2228570 and the risk of developing the disease by homozygous model (P=0.034, OR=1.803, 95% CI 1.046 - 3.106). However, no significant correlations were found between BsmI (rs1544410) or ApaI (rs7975232) gene polymorphisms and the susceptibility to the disease. To our knowledge, we reported for the first time that VDR gene TaqI (rs731236) and FokI (rs2228570) polymorphisms may contribute to the increased risk of chronic osteomyelitis in Chinese population."

We clarified the roles of the HLA-DP/DQ gene in HBV infection in different nationalities. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HLA-DP (rs9277471, rs9277535 and rs9277542) and the SNP rs9272346 in HLA-DQ were studied. In total, 779 patients were recruited to this study, including 400 Chinese Han and 399 Uygurs. The rs9277535 variant genotypes were directly associated with HBV persistence compared to healthy controls in an additive model of the Chinese Han population (odds ratio [OR]=1.88, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.03-3.41, P=0.040), and in a recessive model of the Chinese female population (OR=2.02, 95% CI=1.26-3.24, P=0.003). In addition, rs9277471 and rs9277542 variant genotypes significantly decreased the risk of HBV infection compared to healthy controls in an additive model of the Chinese Han population (OR=0.53, 95% CI=0.29-0.98, P=0.042; OR=0.53, 95% CI=0.29-0.97, P=0.039) and in a dominant model of the Chinese female population (OR=0.50, 95% CI=0.31-0.80, P=0.004; OR=0.49, 95% CI=0.31-0.79, P=0.003).

In addition, allele G of rs9277346 was marginally related to a reduction in risk for HBV infection in the Uygur population. Our study suggests that HLA-DP/DQ polymorphisms can affect susceptibility and resistance to HBV infection in Chinese populations, and are possibly linked to race and sex."
27280334,27280334,Association of a type 2 diabetes genetic risk score with insulin secretion modulated by insulin sensitivity among Chinese Hans.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. The present study aimed to identify the influence of insulin sensitivity on the genetic risk of impaired insulin secretion among a Chinese Han population. For 3229 controls and 1994 treatment-naïve T2D, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 24 T2D-related genomic loci were genotyped and a genetic risk score (GRS) was constructed. Results showed that GRS was associated with insulin secretion and disposition indices in both controls and treatment-naïve T2Ds. Upon stratifying the participants into tertiles by the Matsuda index, we observed an inhibitory relationship between the GRS and insulin secretion in low insulin sensitive but not in high insulin sensitive controls and treatment-naïve T2Ds. Moreover, low insulin sensitive individuals exhibited more severe impairment in insulin secretion and beta cell response to insulin sensitivity with an increase in risk alleles. Our findings identified that the association of GRS with insulin secretion was strongly modulated by insulin sensitivity in both controls and T2Ds of Chinese Han. It indicates that insulin sensitization should be emphasized in prevention and treatment of T2D for beta cell protection."

However, it remains unclear how to identify those who are susceptible to ER-positive breast cancer. Accordingly, there is a great demand for a probe into the predisposing factors so as to provide precise chemoprevention. Recent evidence has indicated that ERα expression can be regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs), such as miR-206, in breast cancer. We assumed that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the miR-206-binding sites of the target genes may be associated with breast cancer susceptibility with different ER statuses."

In order to validate the association of the rs17125944 polymorphism with LOAD risk in the northern Han Chinese, we recruited a case-control study of 2338 Han Chinese subjects (984 cases and 1354 age- and gender-matched controls). Our results demonstrated that there was no significant association between the rs17125944 polymorphism and LOAD (genotype: P = 0.953; allele: P = 0.975). Furthermore, no significant differences were observed in alleles and genotypes distribution after stratification by apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 and multivariate logistic regression analysis. We also performed a meta-analysis in 81908 individuals. The meta-analysis showed that the C allele is the risk factor for LOAD in Caucasian group (OR = 1.15, 95 % CI = 1.10-1.20) and combined population (OR = 1.13, 95 % CI = 1.08-1.19). While in Chinese population, the C allele is not associated with increased risk of LOAD (OR = 1.07, 95 % CI = 0.89-1.28). In conclusion, our study showed that the rs17125944 polymorphism in FERMT2 gene might not be association with LOAD in northern Han Chinese population."

27232852,27232852,Strong association of SLC1A1 and DPF3 gene variants with idiopathic male infertility in Han Chinese.,"Male infertility is a multifactorial syndrome encompassing a wide variety of disorders. In recent years, several genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association studies (GWAS) have been performed on azoospermia and/or oligozoospermia in different populations including two GWAS on nonobstructive azoospermia in China; however, the association of SNPs with idiopathic male infertility, especially asthenozoospermia and oligozoospermia, and their correlation with semen parameters are still not clear. To investigate genetic variants associated with idiopathic male infertility (asthenozoospermia, oligozoospermia, and oligoasthenozoospermia) in Chinese Han people, 20 candidate SNPs were selected from GWAS results and genotyped using the Sequenom MassARRAY assay. A total of 136 subfertile men and 456 healthy fertile men were recruited. rs6476866 in SLC1A1 (P = 1.919E-4, OR = 0.5905, 95% CI: 0.447-0.78) and rs10129954 in DPF3 (P = 0.0023, OR = 2.199, 95% CI: 1.311-3.689) were strongly associated with idiopathic male infertility. In addition, positive associations were observed between asthenozoospermia and rs215702 in LSM5 (P = 0.0016, OR = 1.479, 95% CI: 1.075-2.033) and between oligoasthenozoospermia and rs2477686 in PEX10 (P = 0.0011, OR = 2.935, 95% CI: 1.492-5.775). In addition, six SNPs (rs215702 in LSM5, rs6476866 in SLC1A1, rs10129954 in DPF3, rs1801133 in MTHFR, rs2477686 in PEX10, and rs10841496 in PED3A) were significantly correlated with semen quality alterations.

Considering the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs920778 (C>T) could influence HOTAIR expression and cancer predisposition in other malignancies, we herein investigated the association between rs920778 status and cervical cancer susceptibility in a Chinese population. Using the specific TaqMan PCR assay, we genotyped rs920778 in 215 cervical cancer patients and 430 age-matched healthy controls. As shown in our data, TT genotype of rs920778 was significantly correlated with the upregulation of HOTAIR (p = 0.008). Compared with the healthy control, TT genotype and T allele notably indicated a much higher risk of cervical cancer [TT genotype: odds ratio (OR) = 2.186, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.378-3.466, p = 0.003; T allele: OR = 1.556, 95% CI = 1.221-1.981]. In addition, we also found that the TT genotype of rs920778 was correlated with advanced tumor stage (p = 0.039), highly histological grade (p = 0.013), lympho node metastasis (p < 0.001) and positive infection of high risk HPV (p < 0.001). Among the patients who underwent concurrent chemo-radiotherapy, TT genotype carriers present notably resistance to the combination of EBRT + ICBT + cisplatin (p = 0.023). In conclusion, we firstly reported that TT genotype of HOTAIR rs920778 was significantly associated with the cervical cancer susceptibility. Moreover, the TT genotype of rs920778 might be a potent prognostic marker in cervical cancer patients."

The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of CD40 and CXCR4 genes polymorphisms on CAD susceptibility and the blood lipid levels and history of cardiovascular risk factors in a Chinese Han population. Materials and Methods. A total of 583 unrelated patients with CAD and 540 controls were recruited. Two tag SNPs (rs4239702 and rs1535045) at the CD40 locus and one tag SNP (rs2228014) at the CXCR4 locus were genotyped using the SEQUENOM Mass-ARRAY system. Results. After adjusting the risk factors, the frequency of rs1535045-T allele was also higher in patients than controls. Haplotype analysis showed that the rs4239702(C)-rs1535045(T) haplotype was associated with CAD. People with rs4239702-TT genotype had higher blood lipid levels in case group while it was not in the control group. History of cardiovascular risk factors showed no association for the three SNPs in case group and control group. Conclusions. rs1535045 in CD40 gene is likely to be associated with CAD in the Chinese Han population. rs4239702(C)-rs1535045(T) haplotype was associated with CAD. Only in CAD patients, the blood lipid level of patients with rs4239702-TT genotype was higher than other patients. CXCR4 gene may not relate to CAD."
27222475,27222475,Genetic polymorphism of the Nrf2 promoter region is associated with vitiligo risk in Han Chinese populations.,"The nuclear factor erythroid-derived two-like 2-antioxidant response element (Nrf2-ARE) pathway and its downstream antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1 or HO-1) play essential roles in H2 O2 -induced oxidative damage in human melanocytes. However, the link between Nrf2 promoter polymorphisms and susceptibility to oxidative stress-related diseases such as vitiligo is unknown. This study evaluated the association of the Nrf2 and HO-1 genes polymorphisms with vitiligo susceptibility. In this case-control study of 1136 Han Chinese vitiligo patients and 1200 controls, Nrf2 (rs35652124 and rs6721961) and HO-1 (rs2071746) genes were genotyped by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Overall, a significantly decreased risk of vitiligo was found to be associated with Nrf2 rs35652124 CC and combined (CT+CC) genotypes [odds ratio (OR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50-0.83 and OR, 0.84, 95% CI 0.71-0.99, respectively], as well as among subgroups: female, onset age ≤20 and never smoker. We subsequently found that Nrf2 rs35652124 C allele had higher transcriptional activity in the luciferase reporter assay compared with Nrf2 rs35652124 T allele. Furthermore, we investigated serum HO-1 activity was associated with the rs35652124 CT+CC genotype and lower in patients than in controls (P = 0.024). Logistic regression analysis showed a dose-response relationship between lower vitiligo risk and increased HO-1 activity in rs35652124 CT+CC genotype carriers (Ptrend < 0.05). These findings indicate that the C allele of rs35652124 located in the promoter region of Nrf2 gene is associated with protective effect on vitiligo in a Han Chinese population."
27189002,27189002,Detecting the QTL-allele system of seed isoflavone content in Chinese soybean landrace population for optimal cross design and gene system exploration.,"Utilizing an innovative GWAS in CSLRP, 44 QTL 199 alleles with 72.2 % contribution to SIFC variation were detected and organized into a QTL-allele matrix for cross design and gene annotation. The seed isoflavone content (SIFC) of soybeans is of great importance to health care. The Chinese soybean landrace population (CSLRP) as a genetic reservoir was studied for its whole-genome quantitative trait loci (QTL) system of the SIFC using an innovative restricted two-stage multi-locus genome-wide association study procedure (RTM-GWAS). A sample of 366 landraces was tested under four environments and sequenced using RAD-seq (restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing) technique to obtain 116,769 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) then organized into 29,119 SNP linkage disequilibrium blocks (SNPLDBs) for GWAS. The detected 44 QTL 199 alleles on 16 chromosomes (explaining 72.2 % of the total phenotypic variation) with the allele effects (92 positive and 107 negative) of the CSLRP were organized into a QTL-allele matrix showing the SIFC population genetic structure. Additional differentiation among eco-regions due to the SIFC in addition to that of genome-wide markers was found. All accessions comprised both positive and negative alleles, implying a great potential for recombination within the population. The optimal crosses were predicted from the matrices, showing transgressive potentials in the CSLRP. From the detected QTL system, 55 candidate genes related to 11 biological processes were χ (2)-tested as an SIFC candidate gene system. The present study explored the genome-wide SIFC QTL/gene system with the innovative RTM-GWAS and found the potentials of the QTL-allele matrix in optimal cross design and population genetic and genomic studies, which may have provided a solution to match the breeding by design strategy at both QTL and gene levels in breeding programs."

Significant associations between rs17716310 and CRC risk were found in Present Study including 1075 CRC cases and 1999 controls (additive model: OR = 1.149, 95% CI = 1.027-1.286, P = 0.016), and in Combined Study including 1766 cases and 2708 controls (additive model: OR = 1.145, 95% CI = 1.045-1.254, P = 0.004). Dual luciferase reporter gene assays indicated that the variant C allele obviously increased transcriptional activity. Using TCGA datasets, we indicated rs17716310 as a cis expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for the gene SMAD5, whose expression was significantly higher in CRC tissues. These findings suggested that the functional polymorphism rs17716310 A > C might be a genetic modifier for CRC, promoting the expression of SMAD5 that belonged to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway."
27174169,27174169,PARK16 is associated with PD in the Malaysian population.,"PARK16 was identified as a risk factor for Parkinson's disease in a Japanese cohort; however, subsequent studies in the other populations including the Chinese, European, Caucasian, and Chilean have shown a protective role instead. To investigate this locus in our Malaysian cohort, 1,144 individuals were screened for five SNPs in the PARK16 locus and logistic regression analysis showed that the A allele of the rs947211 SNP reduced the risk of developing PD via a recessive model (Odds ratio 0.57, P-value 0.0003). Pooled analysis with other Asian studies showed that A allele of the rs947211 SNP decreased the risk of developing PD via a recessive model (Odds ratio 0.71, P-value 0.0001). In addition, when meta-analysis was performed with other Asian population, three SNPs (rs823128, rs823156, and rs11240572) reduced risk of developing PD via a dominant model. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
27166265,27166265,No association of the single nucleotide polymorphism rs8044769 in the fat mass and obesity-associated gene with knee osteoarthritis risk and body mass index: A population-based study in China.,"Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported significant association of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs8044769 in the fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) with osteoarthritis (OA) risk in European populations. However, these findings have not been confirmed in Chinese populations."
27168739,27168739,Association of single nucleotide polymorphism rs2076185 in chromosome 6P24.1 with premature coronary artery diseases in Chinese Han population.,To study the association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2076185 in chromosome 6p24.1 with the premature coronary artery diseases (PCAD) in Chinese Han population.
27173281,27173281,Association between the pre-miR-196a2 rs11614913 polymorphism and gastric cancer susceptibility in a Chinese population.,"We did a case-control study to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the association of the pre-miR-196a2 rs11614913 polymorphism with gastric cancer. Between January 2013 and December 2014, 182 patients newly diagnosed with primary gastric cancer and 182 control subjects were recruited at Zhengzhou People's Hospital. For SNP genotyping, we used the Assay Designer 3.1 to design the primers of polymerase chain reaction. Using the chi-square test, we found that patients with gastric cancer were more likely to be alcohol drinkers (χ(2) = 4.4, P = 0.04), to have a family history of cancer in the first relatives (χ(2) = 5.29, P = 0.02), and to be infected with Helicobacter pylori (χ(2) = 23.39, P < 0.001). A significant difference in the genotype distributions of rs11614913 was observed in our study (χ(2) = 6.66, P = 0.04). By logistic regression analysis, we found that the CC genotype of rs11614913 was associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer in a codominant model (OR = 2.68, 95%CI = 1.17-6.44). By stratification analysis, we found that the CC genotype was associated with a strongly increased risk of gastric cancer in drinkers when compared with the TT+TC genotype (OR = 5.63, 95%CI = 1.54-30.76). In conclusion, the results of our study suggest an association between the rs11614913 gene polymorphism and an elevated risk of gastric cancer, especially in drinkers."
27158361,27158361,Polymorphism rs2200733 at chromosome 4q25 is associated with atrial fibrillation recurrence after radiofrequency catheter ablation in the Chinese Han population.,"To test polymorphisms rs2200733 (chromosome 4q25) and rs2106261 (ZFHX3) were associated with AF recurrence after catheter ablation in a Chinese Han cohort. A total of 235 AF patients who underwent catheter ablation were recruited consecutively. Two polymorphisms were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and genotyped using high resolution melting analysis. Primary endpoints for AF recurrence were defined as the time to the first recurrence of atrial tachycardia/flutter/fibrillation (AT/AF). AT/AF recurrence was observed in 76 patients (35%). Allelic analysis demonstrated that rs2200733 was strongly associated with AF recurrence after ablation (P = 0.011) and the minor allele T increased the risk for recurrence (OR = 1.715). Diameters of the right atrium as well as the left and right superior pulmonary veins (PVs) were associated with rs2200733 in different genetic models (P = 0.040, 0.047 and 0.028, respectively). No significant association was detected between rs2106261 and AT/AF recurrence after ablation or atrial/PV diameters in any models. On multivariate Cox regression analysis, only rs2200733 was an independent factor of AF recurrence after ablation (HR = 0.532, P = 0.022). In Chinese Han population, rs2200733 but not rs2106261 is associated with AT/AF recurrence after ablation. The patients with genotype TT have larger size of right atrium and superior PVs than those of CC genotype. The findings suggest that rs2200733 may play a key role in regulating proper development and differentiation of atria/PVs."
27162544,27162544,Combining Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase Genetic Variant rs2736100 with Epidemiologic Factors in the Prediction of Lung Cancer Susceptibility.,"Genetic variants from a considerable number of susceptibility loci have been identified in association with cancer risk, but their interaction with epidemiologic factors in lung cancer remains to be defined. We sought to establish a forecasting model for identifying individuals with high-risk of lung cancer by combing gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms with epidemiologic factors. Genotyping and clinical data from 500 lung cancer cases and 500 controls were used for developing the logistic regression model. We found that lung cancer was associated with telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) rs2736100 single-nucleotide polymorphism. The TERT rs2736100 model was still significantly associated with lung cancer risk when combined with environmental and lifestyle factors, including lower education, lower BMI, COPD history, heavy cigarettes smoking, heavy cooking emission, and dietary factors (over-consumption of meat and deficiency in fish/shrimp, vegetables, dairy products, and soybean products). These data suggest that combining TERT SNP and epidemiologic factors may be a useful approach to discriminate high and low-risk individuals for lung cancer."
27158408,27158408,Prevalence of ABCB4 polymorphisms in gallstone disease in han-Chinese population.,"ATP Binding Cassette Transporter A4 (ABCB4) is a sterol export pump that regulates excretion of biliary cholesterol. We tested association between ABCB4 polymorphisms and gallstone disease using meta-analysis. In a cross-sectional study, 296 subjects were recruited from a hospital-based population. Total of 171 subjects were diagnosed as gallstone disease by abdominal ultrasonography from three cohort studies. We evaluated prevalence of ABCG8 rs11887534 (D19H) as a positive control, and the ABCB4 rs1202283 and rs2230028 polymorphisms on Chinese population were screened by meta-analysis and genotyped using TaqMan® SNP assay. Stata/SE 11.0 software and random-effects model were used in meta-analyzing 3 cohort between study heterogeneity. Four studies including three cohorts were used for final meta-analysis. In allelic model, minor alleles of ABCB4 rs1202283 (OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.25-0.67, P<0.001) and of ABCB4 rs2230028 (OR = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.06-0.22, P = 0.001) were associated with an increased risk for gallstone disease in Europeans. Funnel plot and Egger's test suggested absence of publication bias. Concentration of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) (P = 0.015) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) (P = 0.028) were significantly higher in subjects with gallstones disease than controls. ABCB4 rs1202283 (heterozygote AG) (P<0.0001), rs2230028 (heterozygote CT) (P = 0.023) and ABCG8 rs11887534 (heterozygote CG) (P = 0.006) were significantly associated with gallstone disease in Chinese population. Genetic risk associated with ABCB4 rs2230028 (homozygote GG) polymorphism was dominated in asymptomatic gallstone disease (95% C.I.: 0.219-0.768; P = 0.005). In conclusion, carriers of ABCB4 rs1202283, rs2230028 are at an increased risk for gallstone disease, while ABCB4 rs2230028 is associated with asymptomatic gallstone disease."
27164084,27164084,Association of the MicroRNA-146a SNP rs2910164 with Ischemic Stroke Incidence and Prognosis in a Chinese Population.,"We conducted a case-control study investigating the association between the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2910164 in microRNA (miR)-146a and the risk and prognosis of stroke. We recruited a total of 1139 ischemic stroke patients and 1585 sex- and age-matched control subjects. After a median follow-up period of 4.5 years, 1071 of these ischemic stroke patients were then recruited for a prospective study. Our study revealed that rs2910164 was not associated with ischemic stroke incidence (odds ratio = 1.00; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.80-1.24; p = 0.985) by multivariate logistic regression. Meta-analysis of our case-control study and three others on Asian populations also suggested that there was no relationship between rs2910164 and ischemic stroke incidence. The significance of differences in long-term outcomes was examined by the log-rank test of the respective comparison groups. The prospective study showed that rs2910164 led to a 1.56-fold increased risk of stroke recurrence (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.10-2.20; p = 0.013) and a 2.13-fold increased risk of death caused by cardiovascular disease or stroke (Csdeath) (HR = 2.13; 95% CI = 1.31-3.46; p = 0.002). The independent association of rs2910164 with stroke prognosis was evaluated using Cox regression models. Therefore, rs2910164 appears to be a strong predictor of stroke prognosis but not of stroke incidence in Asian populations."
27158346,27158346,NEDD4 single nucleotide polymorphism rs2271289 is associated with keloids in Chinese Han population.,"Keloids are abnormally raised fibroproliferative lesions that usually occur following cutaneous traumas. Recently, a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) has identified multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three genetic loci that are associated with keloids in Japanese population. Subsequently, two reported loci 1q41 (rs873549 and rs1442440) and 15q21.3 (rs2271289) for keloids were confirmed in selected Chinese population. The association of these SNPs with clinical features of keloids, has not yet been studied. To explore the role of these SNPs in the pathogenesis of keloids, we performed a case-controlled study in another independent Chinese Han population to analyze the correlation between 4 SNPs (rs873549, rs2118610, rs1511412, rs2271289) and keloids phenotypes. 309 keloids patients and 1080 control subjects were included. The results showed that, in the dominant mode of inheritance, the minor allele T of SNP rs2271289 had significantly higher odd ratios (ORs) in the severe keloid group compared with both the controls and the mild keloid group. The ORs were maintained after Bonferroni's correction (OR: 4.09, 95% CI: 1.78-9.37, P-value 3.25E-04). The ratio of the severe: mild OR for rs2271289 (dominant model) is (4.73/1.84=2.57). Similar associations in SNP rs2271289 were seen for groups with no family history and multiplesite compared with the control groups. No associations between keloid number, family history or severity relative to the controls were observed for the other three SNPs. Our data support that rs2271289 is strongly associated with severe keloids and might contribute to the complexity of clinical features of keloids."
27174326,27174326,Association of Common Genetic Variants in Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Kinase 4 with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in a Chinese Han Population.,"A study has identified several novel susceptibility variants of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4) gene for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) within the German population. Among the variants, five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MAP4K4 (rs1003376, rs11674694, rs2236935, rs2236936, and rs6543087) showed significant association with T2DM or diabetes-related quantitative traits. We aimed to evaluate whether common SNPs in the MAP4K4 gene were associated with T2DM in the Chinese population."

27156032,27156032,Analysis of the association of VIPR2 polymorphisms with susceptibility to schizophrenia.,"In a previous study, we confirmed that copy number variants (CNVs) within the VIPR2 gene in Han Chinese individuals exhibit an increased risk of schizophrenia (SCZ). Herein, we further analyzed the association of eight tagged single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) from the HapMap database with SCZ susceptibility. However, we found no significant positive signals in overall association and haplotypes analyses. Interestingly, significant SNP-SNP interaction signals associated with the risk of SCZ were observed using Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) analysis. Furthermore, the 'CC' genotype of the VIPR2 gene was nominally associated with an increased risk of SCZ in male patients."

To date, the exact etiopathogenesis of DM remains elusive. To explore the genetic basis of DM, we conducted genome-wide genotyping analysis of 127 patients and 1566 healthy controls by Illumina Human OmniZhongHua-8 BeadChips in the Chinese Han population. We investigated whether the three SNP (rs7750458, rs9501251 and rs9500928) at 6p21.32 in the HLA-DPB1 gene were significantly associated with DM (P < 5 × 10"

Chemokine (C-C motif) Ligand 2 (CCL2) was one of such chemokines important for both primary tumor development and metastasis of various cancers. Polymorphism at rs3760396 of CCL2 genes is associated with the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The goal of our study was to examine the relationship of genetic polymorphisms rs3760396 with the susceptibility of lung cancer and its pathological subtypes in Han-ancestry Chinese population."
27122304,27122304,Association between interleukin-21 gene polymorphisms (rs12508721) and HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Interleukin-21 (IL-21), as a multifunctional cytokine, plays an important role in many diseases, such as cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. We aimed to investigate the relationship between polymorphisms of IL-21 gene and susceptibility of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a Chinese population. Studied subjects were divided into three groups: 100 patients with HBV-related HCC, 115 patients with chronic HBV infection and 127 healthy controls. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood, and the polymerase chain reaction-ligase detection reaction (PCR-LDR) method was used to genotype the SNPs (rs2221903, rs907715 and rs12508721) within IL-21 gene. Our results showed that IL-21 polymorphisms were associated with the risk of HCC and chronic HBV infection when compared with healthy controls. The rs2221903A/G AG genotype was associated with a higher risk of chronic HBV infection when compared with healthy controls [AG versus AA + GG, P = 0.036, OR = 1.898, 95%CI = 1.038-3.471]. The rs12508721C/T TT genotype was related with a lower risk of chronic HBV infection and HBV-related HCC than in healthy controls [TT versus CT + CC, P = 0.026, OR = 0.451, 95%CI = 0.221-0.920; P = 0.049, OR = 0.482, 95%CI = 0.231-1.005]. No significant difference in the genotype and allele distrubutions of rs907715G/A SNP was observed in the HBV-related HCC group, chronic HBV-infected group and the healthy control group when compared to each other. Our findings suggest that the rs12508721T/C and rs2221903A/G polymorphisms of IL-21 gene are associated with the susceptibility of HBV-related HCC and chronic HBV infection. The genetic variant may in fact cause protection against the HBV-related HCC. However, the function in these SNPs of IL-21 gene needs to clarify the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of HBV-related HCC further."
27144521,27144521,NME8 rs2718058 polymorphism with Alzheimer's disease risk: a replication and meta-analysis.,"Recently, a large meta-analysis of five genome wide association studies (GWAS) has identified that a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2718058, adjacent to gene NME8 on chromosome 7p14.1, was associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in Caucasians. However, the effect of rs2718058 on other populations remains unclear. In order to explore the relationship between rs2718058 and LOAD risk in a North Han Chinese population, we recruited 984 LOAD cases and 1354 healthy controls that matched for sex and age in this study. The results showed no significant differences in the genotypic or allelic distributions of rs2718058 polymorphism between LOAD cases and healthy controls, even though after stratification for APOE ε4 status and statistical adjustment for age, gender and APOE ε4 status (p > 0.05). However, a meta-analysis conducted in a sample of 82513 individuals confirmed a significant association between SNP rs2718058 and LOAD risk (OR = 1.08, 95%CI = 1.05-1.11) in the whole population. But there was still no positive results in Chinese subgroup (OR = 1.05, 95%CI = 0.93-1.17). In conclusion, the rs2718058 near gene NME8 on chromosome 7p14.1 might not play a major role in the genetic predisposition to LOAD in the North Han Chinese."
27114095,27114095,Association Between Osteopontin Gene Polymorphisms and Cerebral Palsy in a Chinese Population.,"Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neurological disorder affecting movement and posture that develops as a complication of prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal brain injury. Such non-progressive brain injury is often accompanied by neonatal encephalopathy and inflammation. The widely expressed soluble cytokine osteopontin (OPN) plays an important role in inflammation and neurological protection. Therefore, it is of great interest to study the relationship between CP and genetic variants of OPN. To explore the genetic association between OPN gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and CP in the Chinese Han population, five SNPs (rs2853744, rs2853749, rs11728697, rs4754, and rs1126616) were genotyped among 715 CP patients and 658 healthy controls using the MassArray platform. Statistical analysis was performed using the online SHEsis program, and Bonferroni correction was applied as necessary. We found an association between rs1126616 and global CP (corrected allelic P = 0.0006 and genotypic P = 0.0011 after Bonferroni correction). The other SNPs were not statistically associated with CP or any of its subgroups. By testing a relatively large sample size, our study demonstrates that the OPN gene SNP rs1126616 is statistically associated with CP. We suspect that the OPN gene might be a susceptibility factor for CP."
27127761,27127761,Association study of the PLXNA4 gene with the risk of Alzheimer's disease.,The Plexin-A 4 (PLXNA4) gene has recently been recognized as a functional candidate gene of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs13232207 of PLXNA4 gene has been reported to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Japanese cohorts. We sought to clarify whether this novel locus gains the same effect in northern Han Chinese.
27120998,27120998,Identification of a Potential Regulatory Variant for Colorectal Cancer Risk Mapping to 3p21.31 in Chinese Population.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have established chromosome 3p21.31 as a susceptibility locus for colorectal cancer (CRC) that lacks replication and exploration in the Chinese population. We searched potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the linkage disequilibrium (LD) block of 3p21.31 with chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) data of histone modification, and tested their association with CRC via a case-control study involving 767 cases and 1397 controls in stage 1 and 528 cases and 678 controls in stage 2. In addition to the tag SNP rs8180040 (odds ratio (OR) = 0.875, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.793-0.966, P = 0.008, P-FDR (false discovery rate) = 0.040), rs1076394 presented consistently significant associations with CRC risk at both stages with OR = 0.850 (95% CI = 0.771-0.938, P = 0.001, P-FDR = 0.005) under the additive model in combined analyses. Supported by the analyses of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), it was suggested that rs1076394 served as an expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) for gene CCDC12 and NME6, while NME6's expression was obviously higher in CRC tissues. Using biofeature information such as ChIP-seq and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data might help researchers to interpret GWAS results and locate functional variants for diseases in the post-GWAS era."
27105532,27105532,Genetic variant of miR-146a rs2910164 C>G and gastric cancer susceptibility.,"The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2910164 G>C within miR-146a has been reported that is associated with the increased risk of gastric cancer (GCa). However, the results are inconclusive, espicially among Asian populations, which probably due to small sample size in each single study. To validate this association and get a more precise estimation, we conducted a large GCa study including 1,125 cases and 1,196 controls in an eastern Chinese population. Our results showed that this SNP was not associated with GCa risk in either of the three genetic models [co-dominant model: CG vs. CC, odds ratio (OR) = 0.99, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.83-1.19; GG vs. CC, OR = 1.03, 95%CI: 0.81-1.32; dominant model: (CG+GG) vs. CC, OR = 1.00, 95%CI = 0.84-1.19; recessive model: GG vs. (CG+CC), OR = 1.04, 95%CI = 0.83-1.29]. Stratified analysis by age, gender, smoking status, drinking status, or tumor location confirmed this non-significant association. In summary, these results suggest that the miR-146a SNP rs2910164 may not be a risk factor for GCa in this Chinese population. Larger and well-designed, preferably prospective studies are needed to further confirm our findings."
27098879,27098879,KIAA0319 gene polymorphisms are associated with developmental dyslexia in Chinese Uyghur children.,"The gene KIAA0319 has been reported to be associated with developmental dyslexia (DD) in previous studies, although the results have not always been consistent. However, few studies have been conducted in Uyghur populations. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the association of KIAA0319 polymorphisms and DD in individuals of Uyghurian descent. We used a custom-by-design 48-Plex SNPscan Kit to genotype 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of KIAA0319 in a group of 196 children with dyslexia and 196 controls of Uyghur descent aged 8-12 years. As a result, 7 SNPs (Pmin=0.001) of KIAA0319 had nominal significant differences between the cases and controls under specific genotypic models. The two SNPs rs6935076 (P=0.020 under dominant model; P=0.028 under additive model) and rs3756821 (P=0.021 under additive model) remained significantly associated with dyslexia after Bonferroni correction. Linkage disequilibrium analysis showed three blocks within KIAA0319, and only a 10-SNP haplotype in block 3 was present at significantly different frequencies in the dyslexic children and controls. This study indicated that genetic polymorphisms of KIAA0319 are associated with an increased risk of DD in the Uyghur population."
27100778,27100778,Association of DCDC2 Polymorphisms with Normal Variations in Reading Abilities in a Chinese Population.,"The doublecortin domain-containing 2 (DCDC2) gene, which is located on chromosome 6p22.1, has been widely suggested to be a candidate gene for dyslexia, but its role in typical reading development over time remains to be clarified. In the present study, we explored the role of DCDC2 in contributing to the individual differences in reading development from ages 6 to 11 years by analysing data from 284 unrelated children who were participating in the Chinese Longitudinal Study of Reading Development (CLSRD). The associations of eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DCDC2 with the latent intercept and slope of children's reading scores were examined in the first step. There was significant support for an association of rs807724 with the intercept for the reading comprehension measure of reading fluency, and the minor ""G"" allele was associated with poor reading performance. Next, we further tested the rs807724 SNP in association with the reading ability at each tested time and revealed that, in addition to significant associations with the two main reading measures (reading fluency and Chinese character reading) over multiple testing occasions, this SNP also showed associations with reading-related cognitive skills, including morphological production, orthographic judgment and phonological processing skills (rapid number naming, phoneme deletion, and tone detection). This study provides support for DCDC2 as a risk gene for reading disability and suggests that this gene is also operative for typical reading development in the Han population."
27119984,27119984,Genetic Variants in SDC3 Gene are Significantly Associated with Growth Traits in Two Chinese Beef Cattle Breeds.,"Identification of the genes and polymorphisms underlying quantitative traits, and understanding these genes and polymorphisms affect economic growth traits, are important for successful marker-assisted selection and more efficient management strategies in commercial cattle (Bos taurus) population. Syndecan-3 (SDC3), a member of the syndecan family of type I transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans is a novel regulator of feeding behavior and body weight. The aim of this study is to examine the association of the SDC3 polymorphism with growth traits in Chinese Jiaxian and Qinchuan cattle breeds (). Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs: 1-4) were detected in 555 cows from three Chinese native cattle breeds by means of sequencing pooled DNA samples and polymerase chain reaction-single stranded conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) methods. We found one SNP (g.28362A > G) in intron and three SNPs (g.30742T > G, g.30821C > T and 33418 A > G) in exons. The statistical analyses indicated that these SNPs of SDC3 gene were associated with bovine body height, body length, chest circumference, and circumference of cannon bone (P < 0.05). The mutant-type variant was superior for growth traits; the heterozygote was associated with higher growth traits compared to wild-type homozygote. Our result confirms the polymorphisms in the SDC3 gene are associated with growth traits that may be used for marker-assisted selection in beef cattle breeding programs."
27108704,27108704,Genetic polymorphisms of cell adhesion molecules in Behcet's disease in a Chinese Han population.,"Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are involved in various immune-mediated diseases. This study was conducted to investigate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CAMs with Behçet's disease (BD) in a Chinese Han population. A two-stage association study was carried out in 1149 BD patients and 2107 normal controls. Genotyping of 43 SNPs was performed using MassARRAY System (Sequenom), polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and TaqMan SNP assays. The expression of CD6 and CD11c was examined by real-time PCR and cytokine production was measured by ELISA. A significantly higher frequency of the CT genotype, and a lower frequency of the CC genotype and C allele of CD6 rs11230563 were observed in BD as compared with controls. Analysis of CD11c rs2929 showed that patients with BD had a significantly higher frequency of the GG genotype and G allele, and a lower frequency of the AG genotype as compared with controls. Functional experiments showed an increased CD11c expression and increased production of TNF-α and IL-1beta by LPS stimulated PBMCs in GG carriers of CD11c rs2929 compared to AA/AG carriers. Our study provides evidence that CD6 and CD11c are involved in the susceptibility to BD in a Chinese Han population."
27095331,27095331,The SNP rs1625579 in miR-137 gene and risk of schizophrenia in Chinese population: A meta-analysis.,"Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder with a high heritability. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1625579 (G/T; T is the common and presumed risk allele) within an intron of miR-137 gene has been recently suggested to contribute to the susceptibility to schizophrenia by a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a sample of predominantly European ancestry. However, subsequent genetic association studies in Chinese population yielded inconsistent results."
27073578,27073578,Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the MVP gene with platinum resistance and survival in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.,"The human major vault protein (MVP) has been linked to the development of multidrug resistance in cancer cells, and overexpression of MVP has been observed in ovarian cancer tissues. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MVP gene and the tumor response to platinum-based chemotherapy and survival of patients affected by epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), in addition to confirm whether tetra-primer amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an accurate genotyping method. For this purpose, two polymorphisms in the MVP gene, namely reference SNP (rs)1057451 and rs4788186, were selected from the data obtained by the International haplotype map (HapMap) Project regarding Chinese Han population, and were evaluated by tetra-primer ARMS-PCR. Upon validation by DNA sequencing, the association of these polymorphisms with platinum resistance, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with EOC was assessed. The results of tetra-primer ARMS-PCR were in agreement with those derived from DNA sequencing. No significant differences were observed between platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant cohorts in terms of allele and genotype distribution of these two polymorphisms in the MVP gene, which were not associated with PFS or OS. However, a trend toward prolonged PFS was observed in patients carrying the heterozygous AG allele at the rs4788186 locus. These results suggest that rs1057451 and rs4788186 variants in the MVP gene are not associated with favorable therapeutic response to platinum or longer survival in Chinese Han patients affected by EOC. In addition, the data of the present study confirm that tetra-primer ARMS-PCR is a trustworthy and economical genotyping method."

27069296,27069296,Association of Plasma IL-32 Levels and Gene Polymorphisms with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in Chinese Han Population.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystemic autoimmune disease. IL-32, a secreted protein, has been reported to be associated with several autoimmune diseases. Our preliminary experiment showed different plasma IL-32 levels than that mentioned in a published report on the same population. In order to elucidate the correlation between IL-32 and SLE, we determined the plasma level and two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL-32 in 152 patients with SLE and 310 healthy controls and analyzed the relationship based on the clinical parameters. The results showed that plasma IL-32 levels in patients with SLE were markedly lower than that in the healthy controls. In the SLE group, patients with detectable IL-32 presented low serum C3 concentrations. Further studies indicated that the rs28372698 SNP was associated with the susceptibility to SLE. Taken together, our results suggested that IL-32 could possibly be a candidate marker to monitor SLE disease stability and screening in future."
27070640,27070640,MADD-FOLH1 Polymorphisms and Their Haplotypes with Serum Lipid Levels and the Risk of Coronary Heart Disease and Ischemic Stroke in a Chinese Han Population.,"This study aimed to detect the association of the MADD-FOLH1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their haplotypes with the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischemic stroke (IS) in a Chinese Han population. Six SNPs of rs7395662, rs326214, rs326217, rs1051006, rs3736101, and rs7120118 were genotyped in 584 CHD and 555 IS patients, and 596 healthy controls. The genotypic and allelic frequencies of the rs7395662 SNP were different between controls and patients, and the genotypes of the rs7395662 SNP were associated with the risk of CHD and IS in different genetic models. Six main haplotypes among the rs1051006, rs326214, rs326217, rs3736101, and rs7120118 SNPs were detected in our study population, the haplotypes of G-G-T-G-C and G-A-T-G-T were associated with an increased risk of CHD and IS, respectively. The subjects with rs7395662GG genotype in controls had higher triglyceride (TG) and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels than the subjects with AA/AG genotypes. Several SNPs interacted with alcohol consumption to influence serum TG (rs326214, rs326217, and rs7120118) and HDL-C (rs7395662) levels. The SNP of rs3736101 interacted with cigarette smoking to modify serum HDL-C levels. The SNP of rs1051006 interacted with body mass index ≥24 kg/m² to modulate serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The interactions of several haplotypes and alcohol consumption on the risk of CHD and IS were also observed."

27059221,27059221,The Human MSI2 Gene is Associated with Schizophrenia in the Chinese Han Population.,"It has been suggested that altered neurogenesis may be involved in the etiology of schizophrenia, so genes impacting on neurogenesis could be potential candidates for schizophrenia. A member of the Musashi family, the human MSI2 gene plays a substantial role in stem-cell maintenance, asymmetric division, and differentiation during neurogenesis. Our previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) implied an association of MSI2 with schizophrenia in a Han Chinese population. To further explore this association, three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs9892791, rs11657292, and rs1822381, were selected for a replication study involving 921 schizophrenia cases and 1244 controls. After rigorous Bonferroni correction, two of the SNPs (rs9892791 and rs11657292) displayed significant differences in allele and genotype distribution frequencies between the case and control groups. When our GWAS and replication samples were combined, the three MSI2 SNPs were all strongly associated with schizophrenia (rs9892791: allelic P = 1.07E-5; rs11657292: allelic P = 1.95E-12; rs1822381: allelic P = 1.44E-4). These results indicate that the human MSI2 gene might be a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia and encourage future research on the functional relationship between this gene and schizophrenia."

Mol. Res. 14 (4): 15904-15905.","The object in this study was a Han Chinese population in Lhasa, with 3658 m in altitude from Chengdu, which has 505 m in altitude by air. Within 24 to 48 h before the subjects arrived in the plateau, they completed a basic situation questionnaire, under the guidance of medical staff. Within 24 to 48 h after they reached the plateau, the subjects completed an acute plateau disease questionnaire. The diagnostic standard of HAPE and the diagnosis of acute plateau disease were adopted by the Lake Louise diagnostic standards in 1991 and the Chinese Medical Association promulgated the domestic diagnostic criteria on the Third National Plateau Medical Academic Seminar. Other diseases that cause acute symptoms of altitude sickness, such as plateau pulmonary edema, plateau cerebral edema, acute respiratory infections and neurosis, were excluded. According to the Lake Louise standard, questionnaire and symptom score values >3 points were diagnosed as HAPE. According to the national standard, the questionnaire and symptom score values >5 points were diagnosed as HAPE. At the present, morbidity of HAPE remains relatively high in China. The research shows that usually in the case of not taking preventive measures, according to the factors such as altitude, speed, and time of arrival, the incidence of HAPE is 30% to 90%. Epidemiological survey shows that HAPE happens at an altitude of 2500 m above the plateau. And an altitude of 3000 m above the plateau of China is occupied 1/6 of the total land area, the population of permanent residents is more than sixty million. We detected the 200 cases who adapted to plateau and the 106 cases of patients with HAPE susceptibility genes SNP locus, and got the key SNP loci of HAPE susceptibility genes. We maked the corresponding gene chip diagnostic kits."

A previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) showed that rs4552569 (on 5q14.3) and rs17095830 (on 12q12) were associated with the risk of AS in Han Chinese, which was not replicated in other two studies. In the current study, rs4552569 and rs17095830 were genotyped in 735 Han Chinese AS patients and 1204 healthy controls using high resolution melting analysis (HRMA). We compared the distributions of genotypes and alleles between AS cases and healthy controls. Rs30187 and rs10865331, which were reported to be associated with AS susceptibility in various populations, were also genotyped and analyzed as positive controls. The results showed that no association between rs4552569/rs17095830 polymorphisms and AS susceptibility was found. On the other hand, an association between rs17095830 and one of AS complication (inflammatory bowel disease) was observed (allelic P value=0.0180; odds ratio[OR]=1.739; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.146-2.639)."
27051045,27051045,Polymorphisms in sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide are not associated with hepatitis B virus clearance in Chinese Tibetans and Uygurs.,"An association between polymorphisms in the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) and the natural course of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the Chinese Han population has been noted. However, it is not known whether these polymorphisms are associated with the risk of developing chronic HBV infection in other racial or ethnic populations. Accordingly, we conducted a candidate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association study in Tibetan and Uygur HBV-infected patients. A total of 1302 subjects including 871 Tibetans and 431 Uygurs were recruited. According to their serological and clinical characteristics, each ethnic group was divided into two groups comprising spontaneous clearance individuals and persistently infected patients. Three SNPs were genotyped by a high resolution melting curve methodology. Among the SNPs, rs2296651 exhibited a minor allele frequency of <0.01. The frequency of allele A at rs4646287 was much higher in Tibetans (9.4% for Tibetans and 4.6% for Uygurs, p<0.001) than in Uygurs, but the frequency of allele A at rs7154439 was the opposite (15.7% for Tibetans and 20.5% for Uygurs, p=0.002). Irrespective of race, no significant differences in the frequency distributions of the three SNP alleles or genotypes were observed between the case and clearance groups. Moreover, none of the NTCP haplotypes were statistically different between the two groups. Data from the Tibetan patients could be grouped by HBeAg status, viral load and HBV genotype; however, no significant differences were found in the SNP genotype distribution for each characteristic. In conclusion, the NTCP polymorphisms we identified tended to be ethnicity-dependent. For Tibetans and Uygurs, no association of the three SNPs (rs7154439, rs4646287 and rs2296651) and their haplotypes with HBV chronicity was observed. Examination of SNPs in NTCP for their specific associations with the course of HBV infection in other ethnic minority groups is now required."

The major A allele in a SORL1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs3824968, is associated with an increased AD risk. However, the role of SORL1 rs3824968 in the normal ageing process has rarely been examined in relation to brain structural morphology. This study investigated the association between SORL1 rs3824968 and grey matter (GM) volume in a nondemented Chinese population of 318 adults within a wide age range (21-92 years). Through voxel-based morphometry, we found that participants carrying SORL1 allele A exhibited significantly smaller GM volumes in the right posterior cingulate, left middle occipital, medial frontal, and superior temporal gyri. Considerable interaction between age and SORL1 suggested a detrimental and accelerated ageing effect of allele A on putamen. These findings provide evidence that SORL1 rs3824968 modulates regional GM volume and is associated with brain trajectory during the adult lifespan."

However, the association between the IL-18-607A/C (rs1946518) promoter polymorphism and IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in a Chinese Han population is still unclear. A total of 166 patients with renal biopsy-proven IgAN and 198 healthy controls were recruited for this study. The SNP was genotyped by the polymerase chain reaction and the high-resolution melting method. Clinical characteristics and pathology grading of patients with IgAN were recorded at the time of the kidney biopsy. There was a significant difference in the distribution between the AA genotype and the AC/CC genotype [P=0.007, OR (95% CI)=1.885 (1.183-3.003)]. However, no significant differences were observed between the rs1946518 SNP and quantitative traits (all P>0.05) or different pathology grades (Lee's grading system and tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis according to the Oxford classification) (P=0.769 and P=0.7) of the patients.

26988277,26988277,Genetic Association of Curative and Adverse Reactions to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Chinese advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer patients.,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is an effective targeted therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but also causes adverse drug reactions (ADRs) e.g., skin rash and diarrhea. SNPs in the EGFR signal pathway, drug metabolism/ transport pathways and miRNA might contribute to the interpersonal difference in ADRs but biomarkers for therapeutic responses and ADRs to TKIs in Chinese population are yet to be fully investigated. We recruited 226 Chinese advanced NSCLC patients who received TKIs erlotinib, gefitinib and icotinib hydrochloride and systematically studied the genetic factors associated with therapeutic responses and ADRs. Rs884225 (T > C) in EGFR 3' UTR was significantly associated with lower risk of ADRs to erlotinib (p value = 0.0010, adjusted p value = 0.042). A multivariant interaction four-SNP model (rs884225 in EGFR 3'UTR, rs7787082 in ABCB1 intron, rs38845 in MET intron and rs3803300 in AKT1 5'UTR) was associated with ADRs in general and the more specific drug induced skin injury.

A steady-state plasma concentration of methadone enantiomers, a measure of methadone metabolism, is an index of treatment response and efficacy of MMT. Although the methadone metabolism pathway has been partially revealed, no genome-wide pharmacogenomic study has been performed to identify genetic determinants and characterize genetic mechanisms for the plasma concentrations of methadone R- and S-enantiomers. This study was the first genome-wide pharmacogenomic study to identify genes associated with the plasma concentrations of methadone R- and S-enantiomers and their respective metabolites in a methadone maintenance cohort. After data quality control was ensured, a dataset of 344 heroin-dependent patients in the Han Chinese population of Taiwan who underwent MMT was analyzed. Genome-wide single-locus and haplotype-based association tests were performed to analyze four quantitative traits: the plasma concentrations of methadone R- and S-enantiomers and their respective metabolites. A significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs17180299 (raw p = 2.24 × 10(-8)), was identified, accounting for 9.541% of the variation in the plasma concentration of the methadone R-enantiomer. In addition, 17 haplotypes were identified on SPON1, GSG1L, and CYP450 genes associated with the plasma concentration of methadone S-enantiomer. These haplotypes accounted for approximately one-fourth of the variation of the overall S-methadone plasma concentration. The association between the S-methadone plasma concentration and CYP2B6, SPON1, and GSG1L were replicated in another independent study. A gene expression experiment revealed that CYP2B6, SPON1, and GSG1L can be activated concomitantly through a constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) activation pathway. In conclusion, this study revealed new genes associated with the plasma concentration of methadone, providing insight into the genetic foundation of methadone metabolism. The results can be applied to predict treatment responses and methadone-related deaths for individualized MMTs."

26989026,26989026,SMAD7 loci contribute to risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and clinicopathologic development among Chinese Han population.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified three loci at 18q21 (rs4939827, rs7240004, and rs7229639), which maps to SMAD7 loci, were associated with risk of diseases of the digestive system. However, their associations with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk remain unknown. A case-control study was conducted to assess genetic associations with HCC risk and clinicopathologic development among Chinese Han population. Three SNPs were genotyped among 1,000 HCC cases and 1,000 controls using Sequenom Mass-ARRAY technology. We observed statistically significant associations for the three SMAD7 loci and HCC risk. Each copy of minor allele was associated with a 1.24-1.36 fold increased risk of HCC. We also found that significant differences were observed between rs4939827 and clinical TNM stage and vascular invasion, as well as rs7240004 and vascular invasion. We also established a genetic risk score (GRS) by summing the risk alleles. The GRS was significantly associated with increased risk of HCC and vascular invasion. Our data revealed the SMAD7 loci is associated with HCC susceptibility and its clinicopathologic development."
26970560,26970560,A post-GWAS confirming the SCD gene associated with milk medium- and long-chain unsaturated fatty acids in Chinese Holstein population.,"The stearoyl-CoA desaturase (delta-9-desaturase) gene encodes a key enzyme in the cellular biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids. In our initial genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Chinese Holstein cows, 19 SNPs fell in a 1.8-Mb region (20.3-22.1 Mb) on chromosome 26 underlying the SCD gene and were highly significantly associated with C14:1 or C14 index. The aims of this study were to verify whether the SCD gene has significant genetic effects on milk fatty acid composition in dairy cattle. By resequencing the entire coding region of the bovine SCD gene, a total of six variations were identified, including three coding variations (g.10153G>A, g.10213T>C and g.10329C>T) and three intronic variations (g.6926A>G, g.8646G>A and g.16158G>C). The SNP in exon 3, g.10329C>T, was predicted to result in an amino acid replacement from alanine (GCG) to valine (GTG) in the SCD protein. An association study for 16 milk fatty acids using 346 Chinese Holstein cows with accurate phenotypes and genotypes was performed using the mixed animal model with the proc mixed procedure in sas 9.2. All six detected SNPs were revealed to be associated with six medium- and long-chain unsaturated fatty acids (P = 0.0457 to P < 0.0001), specifically for C14:1 and C14 index (P = 0.0005 to P < 0.0001). Subsequently, strong linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.88-1.00) was observed among all six SNPs in SCD and the five SNPs (rs41623887, rs109923480, rs42090224, rs42092174 and rs42091426) within the 1.8-Mb region identified in our previous GWAS, indicating that the significant association of the SCD gene with milk fatty acid content traits reduced the observed significant 1.8-Mb chromosome region in GWAS. Haplotype-based analysis revealed significant associations of the haplotypes encompassing the six SCD SNPs and one SNP (rs109923480) in a GWAS with C14:1, C14 index, C16:1 and C16 index (P = 0.0011 to P < 0.0001). In summary, our findings provide replicate evidence for our previous GWAS and demonstrate that variants in the SCD gene are significantly associated with milk fatty acid composition in dairy cattle, which provides clear evidence for an increased understanding of milk fatty acid synthesis and enhances opportunities to improve milk-fat composition in dairy cattle."

Genetic studies have reported a significant association of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the LAMA2 gene with myopia. This study aimed to evaluate the association of the tagging SNPs (tSNPs) in the EGR1 and LAMA2 genes with high myopia in two independent Han Chinese populations. Four tSNPs (rs11743810 in the EGR1 gene; rs2571575, rs9321170, and rs1889891 in the LAMA2 gene) were selected, according to the HapMap database (http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), and were genotyped using the ligase detection reaction (LDR) approach for 167 Han Chinese nuclear families with extremely highly myopic offspring (<-10.0 diopters) and an independent group with 485 extremely highly myopic cases (<-10.0 diopters) and 499 controls. Direct sequencing was used to confirm the LDR results in twenty randomly selected subjects. Family-based association analysis was performed using the family-based association test (FBAT) software package (Version 1.5.5). Population-based association analysis was performed using the Chi-square test. The association analysis power was estimated using online software (http://design.cs.ucla.edu). The FBAT demonstrated that all four tSNPs tested did not show association with high myopia (P>0.05). Haplotype analysis of tSNPs in the LAMA2 genes also did not show a significant association (P>0.05). Meanwhile, population-based association analysis also showed no significant association results with high myopia (P>0.05). On the basis of our family- and population-based analyses for the Han Chinese population, we did not find positive association signals of the four SNPs in the LAMA2 and EGR1 genes with high myopia."
26966377,26966377,Interleukin-27 rs153109 polymorphism and the risk of non-small-cell lung cancer in a Chinese population.,"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has a multifactorial pathogenesis, and the genetic background may be one of the critical etiologic factors. Interleukin (IL)-27, a novel member of the IL-12 family, plays a vital role in antitumor immunity. The aim of the current study was to determine the association of a single nucleotide polymorphism of the IL-27 gene with the risk of NSCLC. The genotype of the IL-27 rs153109 polymorphism was analyzed in 388 patients with NSCLC and 390 healthy controls by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing methods. In the patients with NSCLC, the frequencies of the GG, GA, and AA genotypes and the G and A alleles were 14.0%, 56.4%, 29.6%, 42.1%, and 57.9%, respectively. There were no significant differences in the genotype and allele distributions of the IL-27 rs153109 polymorphism between the patients with NSCLC and healthy controls (P>0.05). Furthermore, no association was determined between this polymorphism and different clinical characteristics in patients with NSCLC. Taken together, these findings suggest that the IL-27 gene may not be involved in the development of NSCLC in the Chinese population."

26954135,26954135,"Novel Polymorphisms of Adrenergic, Alpha-1B-, Receptor and Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor Gamma, Coactivator 1 Beta Genes and Their Association with Egg Production Traits in Local Chinese Dagu Hens.","Adrenergic, alpha-1B-, receptor (ADRA1B) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 beta (PPARGC1B) genes are involved in regulation of hen ovarian development. In this study, these two genes were investigated as possible molecular markers associated with hen-housed egg production, egg weight (EW) and body weight in Chinese Dagu hens. Samples were analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) technique, followed by sequencing analysis. Two novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified within the candidate genes. Among them, an A/G transition at base position 1915 in exon 2 of ADRA1B gene and a T/C mutation at base position 6146 in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of PPARGC1B gene were found to be polymorphic and named SNP A1915G and T6146C, respectively. The SNP A1915G (ADRA1B) leads to a non-synonymous substitution (aspartic acid 489-to-glycine). The 360 birds from the Dagu population were divided into genotypes AA and AG, allele A was found to be present at a higher frequency. Furthermore, the AG genotype correlated with significantly higher hen-housed egg production (HHEP) at 30, 43, 57, and 66 wks of age and with a higher EW at 30 and 43 wks (p<0.05). For the SNP T6146C (PPARGC1B), the hens were typed into TT and TC genotypes, with the T allele shown to be dominant. The TC genotype was also markedly correlated with higher HHEP at 57 and 66 wks of age and EW at 30 and 43 wks (p<0.05). Moreover, four haplotypes were reconstructed based on these two SNPs, with the AGTC haplotype found to be associated with the highest HHEP at 30 to 66 wks of age and with higher EW at 30 and 43 wks (p<0.05). Collectively, the two SNPs identified in this study might be used as potential genetic molecular markers favorable in the improvement of egg productivity in chicken breeding."

26940238,26940238,Association between CYP17A1 rs3824755 and rs743572 gene polymorphisms and Alzheimer's disease in the Chinese Han population.,"The CYP17A1 gene encodes cytochrome P450c17α, an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of sex hormones, which have been linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). An association between the CYP17A1 rs743572 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and AD has been reported; however, the findings are controversial. In the present study, we investigated the association between rs743572 and another SNP, rs3824755, and AD risk in a Chinese Han population (n=207 patients and 239 controls), and their interaction with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele. We found that the C allele and GC+CC genotypes of rs3824755 conferred protection against AD only in APOE e4 carriers. Both rs3824755 and rs743572 polymorphisms showed interactions with APOE e4. The C allele and GC+CC genotypes of rs3824755 acted as protective factors that decreased the risk of APOE e4 in AD. The CYP17A1 rs743572G allele and AG+GG genotypes were found to be potential risk factors that act synergetically with APOE e4. Moreover, the CA and GG haplotypes were protective and conferred a slight risk, respectively, in APOE e4 carriers. These results indicate that CYP17A1 rs3824755 and rs743572 are associated with AD in the Chinese Han population and act in combination with APOE e4."
26929649,26929649,Association of polymorphisms in WWOX gene with risk and outcome of osteosarcoma in a sample of the young Chinese population.,"The WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) gene is a tumor suppressor gene, the abnormal expression of which will lead to osteosarcoma tumorigenesis. Polymorphisms of the WWOX gene are associated with the risk of several malignancies. We hypothesized that genetic variations in the WWOX gene were related to osteosarcoma risk and outcome. In this case-control study, we recruited 276 young osteosarcoma patients and 286 controls from the East Chinese population and genotyped seven tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the WWOX gene (rs10220974C>T, rs12918952G>A, rs3764340C>G, rs1074963C>G, rs383362G>T, rs1424110A>G, and rs12828A>G). We discovered that two SNPs (rs3764340C>G and rs383362G>T) were associated with osteosarcoma risk. The CG genotype and dominant model of rs3764340 indicated elevated risk of osteosarcoma, and similar results were found for rs383362. Furthermore, rs3754340C>G was also related to grade and metastasis risk of osteosarcoma. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence that WWOX gene polymorphisms have the potential to be predictive factors for assessing risk and outcome of osteosarcoma."
26929646,26929646,Association of polymorphisms hOGGI rs1052133 and hMUTYH rs3219472 with risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in a Chinese population.,"This case-control study investigates the possible relationships between the single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs1052133 in the human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) gene and rs3219472 in the human MutY glycosylase homologue (hMUTYH) gene and the risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The two polymorphisms were genotyped in 488 unrelated NPC patients and 573 cancer-free controls. Genotype GG at rs1052133 was associated with significantly lower NPC risk than genotypes GC + CC (odds ratio [OR] 0.770, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.595-0.996, P=0.012). In subgroup analyses, subjects with genotype GG at rs1052133 were at lower risk of NPC than those with GC or CC among individuals older than 40 years (OR 0.706, 95% CI 0.524-0.950), women (OR 0.571, 95% CI 0.337-0.968), and those with no smoking history (OR 0.634, 95% CI 0.463-0.868). No significant association was seen between polymorphisms at hMUTYH rs3219472 and the risk of NPC. However, gene-gene interaction analysis showed that subjects with genotype CC at rs1052133 and genotype AA at rs3219472 (CC/AA) were at 2.887-fold higher risk of NPC than those with GG/GG, 3.183-fold higher risk than those with GG/GA, and 3.392-fold higher risk than those with GG/AA. Our results suggest that hOGG1 rs1052133 polymorphism may play an important role in NPC pathogenesis, especially among women, >40 years old, and those with no smoking history. The hMUTYH rs3219472 polymorphism may interact with hOGG1 rs1052133 polymorphism to influence susceptibility to NPC."
26924317,26924317,Fine-Mapping of ABO Gene Identifies Two Novel SNPs Associated with Large Artery Atherosclerotic Stroke in a Chinese Han Population.,"Recently, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs505922 in ABO gene was related to large artery atherosclerotic (LAA) stroke in Caucasian populations by genome-wide association study (GWAS). This study aimed to determine whether ABO gene polymorphisms are associated with LAA stroke in Chinese Han population. A case-control study was designed, and 644 patients with LAA stroke and 642 healthy controls were enrolled. Ten tagging SNPs (tSNPs) located in ABO gene were genotyped. Associations between genotypes and LAA stroke were analyzed with logistic regression model after adjustment of potential confounders. Although rs505922 was not associated with LAA stroke (TT genotype, adjusted OR = 1.32; 95 % CI, 0.94 to 1.87), two novel SNPs, rs8176668 (AT genotype, adjusted OR = 0.71; 95 % CI, 0.55 to 0.92) and rs2073824 (AA genotype, adjusted OR = 0.72; 95 % CI, 0.57 to 0.92), were associated with LAA stroke. Haplotype analysis indicated that haplotype TC (adjusted OR = 0.72; 95 % CI, 0.54 to 0.95; P = 0.018) in block 1 and haplotype ACA in block 2 (OR = 0.73; 95 % CI, 0.58 to 0.91; P = 0.005) were associated with LAA stroke. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis in the single-locus model indicated that rs2073824 was the most important attributor for predicting risk of LAA stroke. No significant SNP-SNP interactions among the tested SNPs were detected. The results indicated that the genetic variants in ABO gene may influence the risk of LAA stroke in Chinese Han population."

26959381,26959381,Association study between genome-wide significant variants of vitamin B12 metabolism and gastric cancer in a han Chinese population.,"Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality worldwide. Accumulating evidence suggests that vitamin B12 plays an important role in the development of gastric cancer. Genome-wide association studies on metabolites in the one-carbon metabolism pathway identified several vitamin B12-related polymorphisms. Therefore, we investigated the association between variants within vitamin B12-related genes and gastric cancer in a Han Chinese population. Eight variants within the genome were significant vitamin B12-related genes, and they were selected for analysis in this case-control study. This study used a total of 492 gastric cancer patients and 550 noncancer controls. The variant rs526934 from the TCN1 gene was associated with an increased risk of developing gastric cancer. Increased risks of gastric cancer occurrence were observed in the minor G allele (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.03-1.52, P = 0.031) and GG genotype (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.24-3.42, P = 0.0043) compared with the wild-type A allele and AA-GA genotype, respectively. In the haplotypic analysis, we found that the CUBN haplotypes were associated with an altered gastric cancer risk. The rs1801222T/rs11254363A (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.05-1.86, P = 0.021) and rs1801222C/rs11254363G (OR = 4.39, 95% CI = 2.32-8.30, P < 0.0001) haplotypes exhibited an increased gastric cancer risk, while rs1801222T/rs11254363G showed protective effects against gastric cancer (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.25-0.73, P = 0.002) compared with the wild-type rs1801222C/rs11254363A haplotype.

26934125,26934125,The association between the TERT rs2736100 AC genotype and reduced risk of upper tract urothelial carcinomas in a Han Chinese population.,"Upper tract urothelial carcinomas (UTUCs) are originated from urothelium, and consist of renal pelvic carcinomas (RPCs) and ureter carcinomas (UCs). Most UTUCs have already become invasive when diagnosed and there is thus a need to identify high-risk populations for preventive intervention. Recent evidence has accumulated supporting common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to be associated with increased risk of various malignancies. However, little is known about susceptibility loci in relation to UTUC development. We genotyped telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) rs2736100 variants, the SNP associated with a risk of multiple-types of cancer, in patients with UTUC (n = 212) and evaluated the relationship between the rs2736100 and UTUC risk by comparing to 289 healthy controls. Neither AA nor CC genotypes differed significantly between cases and controls, while the AC-carriers were associated with a reduced risk of UTUC compared to the homozygous AA (OR = 0.583; 95% CI: 0.388 - 0.875; P = 0.012) or AA + CC genotypes (0.613; 95% CI: 0.428 - 0.879; P = 0.010). Further analyses showed that the AC variant conferred a lower risk for early stage UTUCs or those with a wt TERT promoter. When UTUCs were sub-grouped into UCs and RPCs, the AC genotype still predicts a significantly lower risk for UC (P = 0.045, OR = 0.597, 95% CI: 0.370 - 0.963), while at a border line significance for RPC (P = 0.055, OR = 0.597, 95% CI: 0.324 - 0.976).

This study indicated that Fas rs2234767 and Bcl2 rs17757541 polymorphisms were risk factors for RA. No association was observed between FasL rs763110 C/T, Bcl2 rs12454712 T/C, and Caspase-8 rs1035142 G/T polymorphisms and RA in this study. The results of this meta-analysis suggested no significant association between FasL rs763110 C/T and RA. However, stratification analysis of this meta-analysis indicated that FasL rs763110 C/T increased the risk of Caucasian RA patients. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that Fas rs2234767 G/A and Bcl2 rs17757541 T/C polymorphisms might be associated with an increased risk of RA.

MATERIAL AND METHODS In this case-control study, we genotyped the SNP rs755622 in 230 patients diagnosed with nephrolithiasis and 250 controls in a Chinese population. RESULTS We found that the rs755622 CG and CC genotypes had a significantly increased nephrolithiasis risk (adjusted OR=1.52, 95% CI=1.03-2.25; OR=2.63, 95% CI=1.21-5.72, P=0.015), compared with GG genotype in the additive model. The rs755622 C carriers (GC/CC) had an adjusted OR (95% CI) of 1.65 (1.14-2.39, P=0.016), compared with the GG genotype in the dominant model. This hazardous effect was more pronounced in subgroup age >46, BMI >24, hypertension, ever smoking, and ever drinking subjects. Moreover, we found that rs755622 could modulate the function of MIF-AS by influencing its folding. CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that the MIF-AS rs755622 polymorphism may have a crucial role in the development of nephrolithiasis."

This study assessed the ALAS2 polymorphism for an association with response to Living-high exercise-high training-low (HiHiLo) training in Han Chinese males."
26883047,26883047,Cloning of TaSST genes associated with water soluble carbohydrate content in bread wheat stems and development of a functional marker.,"We cloned TaSST genes, developed a gene-specific marker for TaSST-D1, and identified three QTL in the Doumai/Shi 4185 RIL population. TaSST-D1 is within one of the three QTL. Sucrose:sucrose-1-fructosyltransferase (1-SST), a critical enzyme in the fructan biosynthetic pathway, is significantly and positively associated with water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content in bread wheat stems. In the present study, wheat 1-SST genes (TaSST) were isolated and located on chromosomes 4A, 7A and 7D. Sequence analysis of TaSST-D1 revealed 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the third exon between cultivars with higher and lower WSC content. A cleaved amplified polymorphism sequence (CAPS) marker, WSC7D, based on the polymorphism at position 1216 (C-G) was developed to discriminate the two alleles. WSC7D was located on chromosome 7DS using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population from a Doumai/Shi 4185 cross, and a set of Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic lines. TaSST-D1 co-segregated with the CAPS marker WSC7D and was linked to SNP marker BS00108793_51 on chromosome 7DS at a genetic distance of 6.1 cM. It explained 8.8, 10.9, and 11.3% of the phenotypic variances in trials at Beijing and Shijiazhuang as well as the averaged data from those environments, respectively. Two additional QTL (QWSC.caas-4BS and QWSC.caas-7AS) besides TaSST-D1 were mapped in the RIL population. One hundred and forty-nine Chinese wheat cultivars and advanced lines tested in four environments were used to validate a highly significant (P < 0.01) association between WSC7D and WSC content in wheat stems. WSC7D can be used as a gene-specific marker for improvement of stem WSC content in wheat breeding programs."
26884762,26884762,The Association of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor δ and Additional Gene-Gene Interaction with C-Reactive Protein in Chinese Population.,"Aims. To examine the association between 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors δ (PPARδ) polymorphisms and C-reactive protein (CRP) level and additional gene-gene interaction. Methods. Line regression analysis was performed to verify polymorphism association between SNP and CRP levels. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) was employed to analyze the interaction. Results. A total of 1028 subjects (538 men, 490 women) were selected. The carriers of the C allele (TC or CC) of rs2016520 were associated with a significant decreased level of CRP, regression coefficients was -0.338, and standard error was 0.104 (p = 0.001). The carriers of the G allele (CG or GG) of rs9794 were also significantly associated with decreased level of CRP, regression coefficients was -0.219, and standard error was 0.114 (p = 0.012). We also found a potential gene-gene interaction between rs2016520 and rs9794. Subjects with rs2016520-TC or CC, rs9794-CG or GG genotypes have lowest CRP level, difference (95% CI) = -0.50 (-0.69 to -0.21) (p < 0.001), compared to subjects with rs2016520-TT and rs9794-CC genotypes. Conclusions. rs2016520 and rs9794 minor allele of PPARδ and combined effect between the two SNP were associated with decreased CRP level."
26973201,26973201,Association between polymorphisms in pre-miRNA genes and risk of lung cancer in a Chinese non-smoking female population.,"MicroRNAs play important roles in the development of human chronic diseases including lung cancer.

26881390,26881390,A genetic study and meta-analysis of the genetic predisposition of prostate cancer in a Chinese population.,"Prostate cancer predisposition has been extensively investigated in European populations, but there have been few studies of other ethnic groups. To investigate prostate cancer susceptibility in the under-investigated Chinese population, we performed single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis on a cohort of Chinese cases and controls and then meta-analysis with data from the existing Chinese prostate cancer genome-wide association study (GWAS). Genotyping 211,155 SNPs in 495 cases and 640 controls of Chinese ancestry identified several new suggestive Chinese prostate cancer predisposition loci. However, none of them reached genome-wide significance level either by meta-analysis or replication study. The meta-analysis with the Chinese GWAS data revealed that four 8q24 loci are the main contributors to Chinese prostate cancer risk and the risk alleles from three of them exist at much higher frequencies in Chinese than European populations. We also found that several predisposition loci reported in Western populations have different effect on Chinese men. Therefore, this first extensive single-nucleotide polymorphism study of Chinese prostate cancer in comparison with European population indicates that four loci on 8q24 contribute to a great risk of prostate cancer in a considerable large proportion of Chinese men. Based on those four loci, the top 10% of the population have six- or two-fold prostate cancer risk compared with men of the bottom 10% or median risk respectively, which may facilitate the design of prostate cancer genetic risk screening and prevention in Chinese men. These findings also provide additional insights into the etiology and pathogenesis of prostate cancer."
26885097,26885097,Association between genetic polymorphism in NFKB1 and NFKBIA and coronary artery disease in a Chinese Han population.,Prior studies have demonstrated NF-κB plays an important role in the development and progression of inflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate whether promoter polymorphisms in NFKB1 and NFKBIA gene are associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in a Chinese Han population.
26884882,26884882,Genetic polymorphisms of C-reactive protein increase susceptibility to HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma in a Guangxi male population.,"C-reactive protein (CRP) is a biomarker of inflammation and the production has been shown to be influenced by genetic variation in CRP gene. HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a typical inflammation-related disease occurs mainly in men. The present study was designed to investigate the association between CRP polymorphisms and HBV-related HCC risk in a Chinese male population. The CRP rs2794521 and rs3093059 SNPs were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method (PCR-RFLP) in 158 HBV patients with HCC, 207 HBV patients without HCC, and 150 unrelated healthy controls. A significant increased HCC risk in HBV patients were observed for the rs3093059 SNP comparing with those without HCC (C allele vs. T allele: adjusted OR=1.56, 95% CI, 1.07-2.29, P=0.021; TC vs. TT: adjusted OR=1.77, 95% CI, 1.13-2.76, P=0.012; TC/CC vs. TT: adjusted OR=1.76, 95% CI, 1.14-2.71, P=0.011). However, we did not observe any significant association of rs3093059 polymorphism with HCC when compared with healthy controls. With respect to rs2794521 polymorphism, no significant associations of this polymorphism with HCC risk were found in this population. In haplotype analysis between HBV patients with HCC and HBV patients without HCC, the TC haplotype was found correlated with a significant increased HCC risk (OR=1.803, 95% CI, 1.237-2.335, P<0.001). We concluded that the CRP rs3093059 polymorphism may play a significant role in the development of HBV-related HCC in the Guangxi male population."
26879180,26879180,Associations of Plasma FGF2 Levels and Polymorphisms in the FGF2 Gene with Obesity Phenotypes in Han Chinese Population.,"Obesity is highly heritable, but the specific genes influencing obesity related traits are largely unknown. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) could influence adipocyte differentiation. However, the association of FGF2 polymorphisms and obesity remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the associations of both the plasma FGF2 levels and SNPs in FGF2 gene with obesity phenotypes in Han Chinese populations. Plasma FGF2 levels were measured and subjected to association analyses in 62 subjects. Eleven SNPs in FGF2 were genotyped and tested for associations in a discovery sample of 1,300 subjects. SNPs significantly associated with obesity were subjected to replication in another independent sample of 1,035 subjects. We found that plasma FGF2 levels were positively correlated with fat mass (P = 0.010). Association analyses in the discovery sample identified three SNPs (rs1449683, rs167428, rs308442) significantly associated with fat mass after multiple testing adjustments (P < 0.0045). Subsequent replication study successfully validated one SNP (rs167428) associated with fat mass (P(combine) = 3.46 × 10(-5)). eQTL analyses revealed that SNPs associated with obesity also affected FGF2 expression. Our findings suggested that high plasma FGF2 level correlated with increased risk of obesity, and FGF2 gene polymorphisms could affect individual variances of obesity in Han Chinese population."
26875095,26875095,"Adaptive evolution of interleukin-3 (IL3), a gene associated with brain volume variation in general human populations.","Greatly expanded brain volume is one of the most characteristic traits that distinguish humans from other primates. Recent studies have revealed genes responsible for the dramatically enlarged human brain size (i.e., the microcephaly genes), and it has been well documented that many microcephaly genes have undergone accelerated evolution along the human lineage. In addition to being far larger than other primates, human brain volume is also highly variable in general populations. However, the genetic basis underlying human brain volume variation remains elusive and it is not known whether genes regulating human brain volume variation also have experienced positive selection. We have previously shown that genetic variants (near the IL3 gene) on 5q33 were significantly associated with brain volume in Chinese population. Here, we provide further evidence that support the significant association of genetic variants on 5q33 with brain volume. Bioinformatic analyses suggested that rs31480 is likely to be the causal variant among the studied SNPs. Molecular evolutionary analyses suggested that IL3 might have undergone positive selection in primates and humans. Neutrality tests further revealed signatures of positive selection of IL3 in Han Chinese and Europeans. Finally, extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) and relative EHH analyses showed that the C allele of SNP rs31480 might have experienced recent positive selection in Han Chinese. Our results suggest that IL3 is an important genetic regulator for human brain volume variation and implied that IL3 might have experienced weak or modest positive selection in the evolutionary history of humans, which may be due to its contribution to human brain volume."

26870188,26870188,Association between the rs11614913 variant of miRNA-196a-2 and the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer.,"Polymorphisms in microRNA (miR) genes and their target sites are a distinct classification of variation in the human genome, which are rapidly being identified and investigated in human cancer. A polymorphism in the miR-196a-2 locus has demonstrated significant associations with various types of cancer, including lung, breast, esophageal and gastric tumors. However, miR-196a-2 has not been fully explored in ovarian cancer, which shares similar biological characteristics with other types of cancer. Therefore, the present study aimed to elucidate the association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the mature sequence of miR-196a-2 (rs11614913, T/C) and the clinical features of 479 Chinese patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). In addition, the biological significance of this polymorphism was investigated in the OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cell line. Risk association was evaluated in 479 cases of EOC patients and 431 controls. SNPs were analyzed by using polymerase chain reaction based restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. miR-196a expression was evaluated with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The influence of miR-196a-2 rs11614913 T/C on EOC cell migration and invasion ability was further investigated"

26871801,26871801,Association of Megsin Gene Variants With IgA Nephropathy in Northwest Chinese Population: A STROBE-Compliant Observational Study.,"Megsin is a mesangial cell-predominant gene that encodes a serpin family protein which is expressed in the renal mesangium. Overexpression of megsin has been observed in the glomeruli of patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN). The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of megsin polymorphisms (rs1055901 and rs1055902) with IgAN in a Chinese population.We examined 351 patients with histologically proven IgAN and compared them with 310 age, sex, and ethnicity-matched healthy subjects. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in megsin were genotyped by Sequenom MassARRAY. SPSS 18.0 was used for statistical analyses, and SNP Stats to test for associations between these polymorphisms and IgAN risk. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were used to assess the relationships.We found that rs1055901 and rs1055902 SNPs were not correlated with susceptibility to IgAN in Northwest Chinese population. Analyses of the relationship between genotypes and clinical variables indicated that in patients with IgAN, rs1055901 was associated with 24-hour proteinuria, an increase in blood pressure, and Lee's grade (P = 0.04, 0.02, and 0.04, respectively), and rs1055902 was associated with 24-hour proteinuria and Lee's grade (P = 0.03 and 0.01, respectively). However, the results showed no association between these gene variants and sex of the patients.These results indicate that megsin gene variants may play a role in the severity, development, and/or progression of IgAN in Northwest Chinese population."
26881045,26881045,"Interplay between Superoxide Dismutase, Glutathione Peroxidase, and Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Gamma Polymorphisms on the Risk of End-Stage Renal Disease among Han Chinese Patients.","Background. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of antioxidants, including superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1), play an important role in the risk for cancer and metabolic disorders. However, little is known regarding the effect of antioxidant SNPs on renal events. Methods. We prospectively enrolled multicenter patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and those without chronic kidney disease (CKD) of Han Chinese origin, with SOD2 (Val16Ala), GPX1 (Pro197Leu), and PPAR-γ (Pro12Ala, C161T) genotyped. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the significant risk determinants for ESRD. Results. Compared to ESRD patients, non-CKD subjects were more likely to have T allele at SOD2 Val16Ala (p = 0.036) and CC genotype at PPAR-γ Pro12Ala (p = 0.028). Regression analysis showed that TT genotype of SOD2 Val16Ala conferred significantly lower ESRD risk among patients without diabetes (odds ratio 0.699; p = 0.018). GPX1 SNP alone did not alter the risk. We detected significant interactions between SNPs including PPAR-γ Pro12Ala, C161T, and GPX1 regarding the risk of ESRD. Conclusion. This is the first and largest study on the association between adverse renal outcomes and antioxidant SNPs among Han Chinese population. Determination of SOD2 and PPAR-γ SNPs status might assist in ESRD risk estimation."

26846592,26846592,Single nucleotide polymorphisms of TNFAIP3 are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus in Han Chinese population.,"The polymorphisms of tumour necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) have been found to associate with several autoimmune diseases. This study aimed to explore the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TNFAIP3 gene with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Han Chinese. Thirty-two SNPs were genotyped in 284 patients with SLE and 630 controls using the ligation detection reaction (LDR) method. The quality control steps and statistical analyses were performed using the PLINK 1.07 package and HAPLOVIEW software. We found that 13 SNPs in TNFAIP3 showed significant association with SLE (P < 1.85 × 10(-3)), and all of them were in high linkage disequilibrium (LD). After conditioning on the SNP rs2230926, other 12 SNPs did not show association (P > 0.27). All 13 SNPs showed most significant association in the dominant model. In haplotype analysis, a long risk SNP haplotype (GCCCGTGTCATGG) showed most significant association (P = 1.00 × 10(-4)). In conclusion, our data suggest that TNFAIP3 is a susceptible gene for SLE in the Han Chinese population."
26848528,26848528,PSCA polymorphisms and gastric cancer susceptibility in an eastern Chinese population.,"The prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) gene, which encodes a prostate-specific antigen (PSA), was identified as a gene involved in cell adhesion and proliferation. The associations between the PSCA rs2294008 and rs2976392 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and gastric cancer (GCa) susceptibility were still controversial. To derive a more precise estimation of the associations, we conducted a case-control study of 1,124 cases and 1,192 controls in an eastern Chinese population. We found that the rs2294008T variant genotypes were associated with an increased GCa risk in this study population (CT vs CC, OR=1.59, 95% CI=1.33-1.89 and CT+TT vs CC, OR=1.38, 95% CI=1.17-1.62). For SNP rs2976392, the variant A genotypes were also associated with an increased GCa risk (AG vs GG, OR=1.61, 95% CI=1.35-1.91 and AG+AA vs GG, OR=1.47, 95% CI=1.25-1.74). The results were further validated by a meta-analysis. In conclusion, the results indicated that the PSCA rs2294008 T and rs2976392 A alleles were low-penetrate risk factors for GCa in this study population. However, large and well-designed studies are warranted to validate our findings."
26852039,26852039,CLPTM1L polymorphism as a protective factor for lung cancer: a case-control study in southern Chinese population.,"Variants of the cleft lip and palate trans-membrane 1 like (CLPTM1L) gene, located on chromosome 5p15.33, were previously determined to influence lung cancer susceptibility. Here, we performed a case-control study to examine the potential association of CLPTM1L single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with lung cancer in a Chinese Han population. We selected four SNPs in the CLPTM1L gene that were previously reported to be associated with lung cancer. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to estimate the strength of the relationship between each CLPTM1L SNP and lung cancer risk. Allelic model analysis revealed that the minor alleles of all four SNPs were significantly associated with decreased lung cancer risk. Similar significant results were detected using genetic model analysis. In addition, we observed a protective effect of haplotype ""TT"" in the CLPTM1L gene. Our results verified that certain CLPTM1L polymorphisms are protective factors against lung cancer in a southern Chinese Han population and may be potential diagnostic and molecular markers for lung cancer patients."
26828298,26828298,Polymorphisms in the receptor for advanced glycation end products gene are associated with susceptibility to drug-resistant epilepsy.,"Increasing evidence has demonstrated that inflammation plays an important role in epilepsy (EP). As a cell-surface molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily, the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is involved in inflammation-related disease. Functional polymorphisms in the regulatory elements and/or ligand-binding regions of RAGE may alter the expression and function of RAGE, thus affecting EP susceptibility. Here, we have identified a novel association between genetic variants in the RAGE G82S locus and EP (p=0.033) using a case-control study in a Chinese population. Further analyses showed that the 82S+ genotype and S allele were more common in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) than in those with drug-responsive EP compared with controls. The loci -374T/A and -429T/C did not demonstrate any association with EP, but the haplotype T-A-A exhibited significantly different frequencies between DRE patients and controls (OR=1.696, 95% CI: 1.188-2.420, P=0.003). Our study provides preliminary evidence that the G82S polymorphism in RAGE is associated with increased DRE risk and that the GS genotype of the G82S locus is a risk factor for DRE in the Chinese population."
26828504,26828504,The Cumulative Effect of Gene-Gene and Gene-Environment Interactions on the Risk of Prostate Cancer in Chinese Men.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a multifactorial disease involving complex genetic and environmental factors interactions. Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions associated with PCa in Chinese men are less studied. We explored the association between 36 SNPs and PCa in 574 subjects from northern China. Body mass index (BMI), smoking, and alcohol consumption were determined through self-administered questionnaires in 134 PCa patients. Then gene-gene and gene-environment interactions among the PCa-associated SNPs were analyzed using the generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) and logistic regression methods. Allelic and genotypic association analyses showed that six variants were associated with PCa and the cumulative effect suggested men who carried any combination of 1, 2, or ≥3 risk genotypes had a gradually increased PCa risk (odds ratios (ORs) = 1.79-4.41). GMDR analysis identified the best gene-gene interaction model with scores of 10 for both the cross-validation consistency and sign tests. For gene-environment interactions, rs6983561 CC and rs16901966 GG in individuals with a BMI ≥ 28 had ORs of 7.66 (p = 0.032) and 5.33 (p = 0.046), respectively. rs7679673 CC + CA and rs12653946 TT in individuals that smoked had ORs of 2.77 (p = 0.007) and 3.11 (p = 0.024), respectively. rs7679673 CC in individuals that consumed alcohol had an OR of 4.37 (p = 0.041). These results suggest that polymorphisms, either individually or by interacting with other genes or environmental factors, contribute to an increased risk of PCa."

26823861,26823861,CD40 -1C>T polymorphism and the risk of lung cancer in a Chinese population.,The co-stimulatory molecule CD40 plays an important role in anti-tumor responses by promoting cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity and differentiation of helper T cells. Growing evidence suggests that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CD40 are associated with the susceptibility to cancer. This study investigated the association between the CD40 -1C/T SNP (rs1883832) and lung cancer in a Chinese population.
26828791,26828791,Polymorphisms in the AKT1 and AKT2 genes and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma risk in an Eastern Chinese population.,"Ethnic Han Chinese are at high risk of developing oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Aberrant activation of the AKT signalling pathway is involved in many cancers, including ESCC. Some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in this pathway may contribute to ESCC susceptibility. We selected five potentially functional SNPs in AKT1 (rs2494750, rs2494752 and rs10138277) and AKT2 (rs7254617 and rs2304186) genes and investigated their associations with ESCC risk in 1117 ESCC cases and 1096 controls in an Eastern Chinese population. None of individual SNPs exhibited an association with ESCC risk. However, the combined analysis of three AKT1 SNPs suggested that individuals carrying one of AKT1 variant genotypes had a decreased ESCC risk [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.42-0.87]. Further stratified analysis found that AKT1 rs2294750 SNP was associated with significantly decreased ESCC risk among women (adjusted OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.43-0.94) and non-drinkers (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.64-0.99). Similar protective effects on women (adjusted OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.37-0.83) and non-drinker (adjusted OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.60-0.94) were also observed for the combined genotypes of AKT1 SNPs. Consistently, logistic regression analysis indicated significant gene-gene interactions among three AKT1 SNPs (P < 0.015). A three-AKT1 SNP haplotype (C-A-C) showed a significant association with a decreased ESCC risk (adjusted OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.52-0.94). Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis confirmed a high-order gene-environment interaction in ESCC risk. Overall, we found that three AKT1 SNPs might confer protection against ESCC risk; nevertheless, these effects may be dependent on other risk factors.

26823859,26823859,B-cell lymphoma 2 rs17757541 C>G polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease in a Chinese population.,"The goal of our study was to evaluate the genetic effects of sixteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in apoptosis-related genes on the development of coronary artery disease (CAD) through a case-control study. A total of 1979 individuals, including 826 CAD cases (aged 67.27 ± 10.26 years) and 1153 non-CAD controls (aged 59.13 ± 10.51 years), were enrolled into the study. The genotypes were determined using a custom-by-design 48-Plex SNPscanTM Kit. The results showed that the BCL2 rs17757541 C>G polymorphism was associated with increased risk of CAD in homozygote comparison and recessive genetic model. However, no association between the other fifteen SNPs and CAD risk was observed. Stratified analyses indicated a significantly increased risk of CAD associated with the BCL2 rs17757541 C>G polymorphism among males and younger patients. Therefore, the results indicated that there is a close correlation between the BCL2 rs17757541 C>G polymorphism and CAD, which suggests that this SNP site should be further studied as a potential biomarker for CAD."
26810186,26810186,Genetic variations in interleukin-6 polymorphism and the association with susceptibility and overall survival of osteosarcoma.,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a central proinflammatory cytokine, may be involved in both development and progression of many human malignancies. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate any associations of IL-6 gene polymorphisms with susceptibility and overall survival of osteosarcoma in a Chinese population. A total of 412 subjects, including 206 patients with osteosarcoma and 206 healthy controls, were recruited and were assessed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in this study. Significant differences of genotype distribution were observed between osteosarcoma cases and controls at the IL-6 -174 G/C genotypes. Compared with the homozygote GG, the heterozygous GC genotype was associated with significantly increased risk for osteosarcoma (odds ratio [OR] = 1.58, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1.13-3.05, p = 0.028); the CC genotype was associated with increased risk for osteosarcoma (OR = 1.57, 95 % CI = 1.21-3.26, p = 0.022). Moreover, the genotype CC of IL-6 -174 G/C carried a higher risk of osteosarcoma metastasis and later Enneking stages, compared with the GG genotype. The IL-6 -174 G/C genotype was associated with risk for development and metastasis of osteosarcoma in Chinese Han population."
26805933,26805933,Common SNP in hsa-miR-196a-2 increases hsa-miR-196a-5p expression and predisposes to idiopathic male infertility in Chinese Han population.,"MicroRNA plays an important role in spermatogenesis. Whether pre-miRNAs polymorphisms are associated with idiopathic male infertility remains obscure. In this study, 1378 idiopathic infertile males and 486 fertile controls were included between 2006 and 2014. Genotype of three polymorphisms (hsa-mir-146a rs2910164, hsa-mir-196a-2 rs11614913, and hsa-mir-499 rs3746444) and expression of miRNA in seminal plasma were examined by TaqMan method. The role of hsa-miR-196a-5p in cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle were also examined in GC-2 cells. Our results demonstrated that rs11614913 of hsa-miR-196a-2 was significantly associated with idiopathic infertility (TT vs. CT: P = 0.014; TT vs. CC: P = 0.005; TT vs. CT + CC: P = 0.003). In following stratified analysis, we found that rs11614913 exhibited a significantly higher risk of asthenospermia, oligozoospermia and azoospermia. However, no significant association was observed between the other two polymorphisms and idiopathic male infertility risk. In a genotype-expression correlation analysis, rs11614913 CC was significantly associated with elevated expression of hsa-miR-196a-5p (P < 0.05). Additionally, apoptosis levels were significantly increased in hsa-miR-196a-5p mimic treated GC-2 cells, while decreased in hsa-miR-196a-5p inhibitor treated GC-2 cells. Our data revealed a significant relationship between hsa-miR-196a-2 polymorphism and idiopathic male infertility."
26792422,26792422,TPM1 polymorphisms and nonsyndromic orofacial clefts susceptibility in a Chinese Han population.,"Located at 15q22 a susceptibility region for nonsyndromic orofacial clefts (NSOC), TPM1 encodes a group of highly conserved ubiquitous actin-binding proteins involved in the muscle contraction and cytoskeleton organization. Considering the multiple functions of TPM1 gene, we investigated the potential relationship between TPM1 polymorphisms and risk of NSOC in a Chinese Han population. Four tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of TPM1 (rs11071720, rs3803499, rs12148828, and rs1972041) were selected to conduct a case-control study with 673 NSOC patients and 705 unrelated healthy controls from a Chinese Han population. The SNPs were genotyped by the IPLEX Sequenom MassARRAY platform. SNP rs1972041GA showed a decreased risk of NSOC in heterozygotes (P = 0.038, OR = 0.77, 95%CI = [0.61, 0.99]). Further stratified analysis revealed an enhanced protective effect of the minor allele G at rs197204 on lip with cleft palate (CLP) and cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) groups under a codominant or dominant model. No association was observed between the remaining three markers (rs11071720, rs3803499, and rs12148828) and NSOC as well as its subgroups. TPM1 polymorphisms might contribute to the etiology of NSOC, and more emphasis should be placed on TPM1 during craniofacial development."

However, the overall results have been inconsistent, likely because primary dystonia may have subtype-specific genetic risk factors. The aim of our study was to assess the association of TOR1A and THAP1 with adult-onset primary focal dystonia (AOPFD), the most common subtype of primary dystonia."
26782385,26782385,Genome-wide analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms in patients with atrophic age-related macular degeneration in oldest old Han Chinese.,"The aim of this study was to identify disease-associated loci in oldest old Han Chinese with atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This genome-wide association study (GWAS) only included oldest old (≥95 years old) subjects in Rugao County, China. Thirty atrophic AMD patients and 47 age-matched non-AMD controls were enrolled. The study subjects underwent a complete ophthalmic examination. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were scanned by Genome-Wide Human Mapping SNP 6.0 Arrays and GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. The results were read and analyzed by the Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. We filtered out the SNPs with a no-call rate ≥10%, MAF P < 0.05, and HWE P < 0.001. The remaining 561,277 SNPs were included in the association analysis. We found that the following 2 SNPs had the highest association with atrophic AMD: rs7624556 (located on 3q24) and rs13119914 (located on 4q34.3). In conclusion, we identified two atrophic AMD-associated SNPs (rs7624556 and rs13119914) in an oldest old Han Chinese population. This finding may lead to new strategies for screening of atrophic AMD for Han Chinese."
26804608,26804608,"Association of GCH1 and MIR4697, but not SIPA1L2 and VPS13C polymorphisms, with Parkinson's disease in Taiwan.","Recently, a large-scale meta-analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data identified several new risk loci that can modulate the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). These associations have yet to be examined in PD patients in Chinese or Asian population. Because ethnic-specific effect is an important concern for GWAS analysis, we genotyped single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the new genetic loci, GCH1 (rs11158026), SIPA1L2 (rs10797576), VPS13C (rs2414739), and MIR4697 (rs329648), to investigate their associations with risk of PD in Taiwan. Another single-nucleotide polymorphism GCH1 rs7155501, previously identified by GWAS listed at the top 20 genes in PDGene database was also included. A total of 1151 study subjects comprising 598 patients with PD and 553 unrelated healthy controls were recruited. The frequency of minor allele (C allele) of GCH1 rs11158026 was found to be significantly higher in PD cases than in controls (p = 0.003). The CC genotype of rs11158026 increased PD risk compared to TT genotype (odds ratio [OR] = 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09, 1.53, p = 0.004). Under additive model, the GCH1 rs11158026 increased the risk of developing PD (OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.10, 1.54, p = 0.002). In recessive model, the genotype TT of MIR4697 rs329648 marginally decreased the PD risk (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.43, 0.90, p = 0.01). The PD patients demonstrated similar genotypic and allelic frequencies in GCH1 rs7155501, SIPA1L2 rs10797576, and VPS13C rs2414739 with the controls. These findings suggest that the GCH1 and MIR4697 but not SIPA1L2 and VPS13C are genetic loci influencing risk of PD in Taiwan."

Detection and treatment of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque of carotid artery before symptoms of cerebral infarction is an effective way to prevent atherosclerotic cerebral infarction. Tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 4 (TNFSF4) plays a key role in the process of atherosclerosis, a common risk factor for both myocardial and cerebral infarctions. Studies have indicated that the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3850641 in TNFSF4 is associated with higher risk of myocardial infarction and SNP rs3861950 in TNFSF4 is associated with higher risk of atherosclerosis cerebral infarction (ACI) ,but little is known about the association between TNFSF4 variations and vulnerable plaque of carotid artery."
26790444,26790444,Association of MDR1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotype variants with multiple myeloma in Chinese Jiangsu Han population.,"Multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene encodes P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which acts as an efflux pump and provides cell protection against various substances, and its single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with the development of malignant hematologic diseases. The present study aimed at investigating whether the MDR1 SNPs and haplotype variants were correlated with the susceptibility to multiple myeloma (MM). A total of 115 MM patients and 153 healthy controls from Jiangsu Han population were enrolled and genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-allele-specific primer (PCR-ASP) method or DNA direct sequencing at MDR1 loci of C1236T, G2677T/A, and C3435T. No significance was found in the distribution of alleles and genotypes in MDR1 three loci. Diplotype analysis has also demonstrated no effect in susceptibility to MM. But, in haplotype analysis, the haplotype of T-G-T was significantly more common than healthy controls (12.6 % in MM group vs. 1.7 % in control group, odds ratios (ORs) = 8.7, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 3.3-22.8, Pc  < 0.01). Our results pointed out that comparable allele, genotype, and diplotype frequencies among MM patients and controls in Chinese Jiangsu Han population were found; the frequency of T-G-T haplotype was significantly increased in MM group compared with the control group, which indicated that this haplotype might be associated with the susceptibility to MM."

26781738,26781738,"Possible introgression of the VRTN mutation increasing vertebral number, carcass length and teat number from Chinese pigs into European pigs.","Vertnin (VRTN) variants have been associated with the number of thoracic vertebrae in European pigs, but the association has not been evidenced in Chinese indigenous pigs. In this study, we first performed a genome-wide association study in Chinese Erhualian pigs using one VRTN candidate causative mutation and the Illumina Porcine 60K SNP Beadchips. The VRTN mutation is significantly associated with thoracic vertebral number in this population. We further show that the VRTN mutation has pleiotropic and desirable effects on teat number and carcass (body) length across four diverse populations, including Erhualian, White Duroc × Erhualian F2 population, Duroc and Landrace pigs. No association was observed between VRTN genotype and growth and fatness traits in these populations. Therefore, testing for the VRTN mutation in pig breeding schemes would not only increase the number of vertebrae and nipples, but also enlarge body size without undesirable effects on growth and fatness traits, consequently improving pork production. Further, by using whole-genome sequence data, we show that the VRTN mutation was possibly introgressed from Chinese pigs into European pigs. Our results provide another example showing that introgressed Chinese genes greatly contributed to the development and production of modern European pig breeds."
26770592,26770592,IL-21 polymorphisms rs907715 and rs2221903 are associated with decreased non-small cell lung cancer susceptibility.,"The etiology of lung cancer is still incompletely understood. Previous studies have suggested the association between IL-21 polymorphisms and autoimmune diseases, however, little is known about its role in lung cancer susceptibility. Here, we investigated the role of two SNPs of IL-21 gene in a cohort of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. A total of 128 NSCLC patients and 156 healthy controls were genotyped. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the association between IL-21 polymorphisms and NSCLC risk. Our data showed that both rs907715 and rs2221903 were significantly associated with lung cancer susceptibility, and patients carrying rs907715A (P = 0.007, adjusted OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.42-0.87) or rs2221903G (P = 0.020, adjusted OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.30-0.90) allele had a decreased risk of NSCLC. Further study identified that the association between IL-21 polymorphisms and NSCLC risk was limited to lung adenocarcinoma. Haplotype analysis revealed that the AG (P = 0.006, OR = 0.072 95% CI = 0.011-0.451) and AA (P = 0.022, OR = 0.657, 95% CI = 0.458-0.941) haplotypes of rs907715/rs2221903 were associated with a decreased risk of NSCLC, whereas the GA (P = 0.0001, OR = 1.932, 95% CI = 1.378-2.710) haplotype was associated with an increased risk. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the association between IL-21 polymorphisms (rs907715 and rs2221903) and NSCLC risk in a Chinese Han population, indicating their potential role in lung cancer detection and treatment."

26765445,26765445,Association Between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in DNA Polymerase Kappa Gene and Breast Cancer Risk in Chinese Han Population: A STROBE-Compliant Observational Study.,"DNA polymerases are responsible for ensuring stability of the genome and avoiding genotoxicity caused by a variety of factors during DNA replication. Consequently, these proteins have been associated with an increased cancer risk. DNA polymerase kappa (POLK) is a specialized DNA polymerase involved in translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) that allows DNA synthesis over the damaged DNA. Recently, some studies investigated relationships between POLK polymorphisms and cancer risk, but the role of POLK genetic variants in breast cancer (BC) remains to be defined. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of POLK polymorphisms on BC risk.We used the Sequenom MassARRAY method to genotype 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in POLK (rs3213801, rs10077427, and rs5744533), in order to determine the genotypes of 560 BC patients and 583 controls. The association of genotypes and BC was assessed by computing the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) from logistic regression analyses.We found a statistically significant difference between patient and control groups in the POLK rs10077427 genotypic groups, excluding the recessive model. A positive correlation was also found between positive progesterone receptor (PR) status, higher Ki67 index, and rs10077427 polymorphism. For rs5744533 polymorphism, the codominant, dominant, and allele models frequencies were significantly higher in BC patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, our results indicated that rs5744533 SNP has a protective role in the postmenopausal women. However, we failed to find any associations between rs3213801 polymorphism and susceptibility to BC.Our results indicate that POLK polymorphisms may influence the risk of developing BC, and, because of this, may serve as a prognostic biomarker among Chinese women."
26756527,26756527,The impact of CACNA1C allelic variation on regional gray matter volume in Chinese population.,"The SNP rs1006737 in CACNA1C gene has been significantly associated with psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) in European populations. In Han Chinese, rs1006737 is also strongly associated with schizophrenia, although the effects of the psychosis risk SNP on related brain functions and structures in this population remain unclear. Here, we examined the association of rs1006737 with gray matter volume in a sample of 278 healthy Han Chinese. A whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis revealed a significant association in the region around right superior occipital gyrus (family-wise error corrected, P = 0.023). Our data provides initial evidence for the involvement of this psychosis genetic risk locus in brain structure variations in Chinese population, and calls for further investigations."

COL4A1 is the most abundant component of type IV collagen in the BM, and COL4A1 variants can present with variable phenotypes that might be related to cerebral palsy (CP). We postulated, therefore, that variations in the COL4A1 gene might play an important role in the etiology of CP. In this study, six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the COL4A1 gene were genotyped among 351 CP patients and 220 healthy controls from the Chinese Han population. Significant association was found for an association between CP and rs1961495 (allele: p = 0.008, odds ratio (OR) = 1.387, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.088-1.767) and rs1411040 (allele: p = 0.009, OR = 1.746, 95% CI = 1.148-2.656) SNPs of the COL4A1 gene. Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis suggested that these SNPs had interactive effects on the risk of CP.

Recent studies demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2293152 in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and rs7574865 in signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) are associated with chronic hepatitis B (CHB)-related HCC in the Chinese population. We hypothesized that these polymorphisms might be related to HCC susceptibility in Thai population as well. Study subjects were divided into 3 groups consisting of CHB-related HCC (n=192), CHB without HCC (n=200) and healthy controls (n=190). The studied SNPs were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The results showed that the distribution of different genotypes for both polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P>0.05). Our data demonstrated positive association of rs7574865 with HCC risk when compared to healthy controls under an additive model (GG versus TT: odds ratio (OR) =2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.06-4.03, P=0.033). This correlation remained significant under allelic and recessive models (OR=1.46, 95% CI=1.09-1.96, P=0.012 and OR=1.71, 95% CI=1.13-2.59, P=0.011, respectively). However, no significant association between rs2293152 and HCC development was observed. These data suggest that SNP rs7574865 in STAT4 might contribute to progression to HCC in the Thai population."

This study is a secondary analysis of the Project of Longevity and Aging in Dujiangyan (PLAD) study. Community-dwelling Chinese people aged 90 years or older were included. G-395A (rs1207568) genotyping in the promoter region of the KLOTHO gene was performed using the TaqMan allelic discrimination assay. Cognitive function was assessed with the mini-mental status examination (MMSE). A total of 706 participants (68.0 % female; mean age 93.5 ± 3.6 years) were included. The KLOTHO G-395A polymorphism genotype frequencies for the whole sample were 2.0 % AA, 30.3 % GA, and 67.7 % GG. The GG genotype frequencies for the cognitive impairment and control groups were 70.2 and 62.7 %, respectively. Cognitive impairment prevalence was significantly lower in the GA+AA group than in the GG genotype group (61.4 vs. 69.0 %, p = 0.044).

26731438,26731438,A comprehensive analysis of NDST3 for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in Han Chinese.,"A novel susceptibility locus (rs11098403) for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BD) was identified in an Ashkenazi Jewish population by a recent large-scale genome-wide association study. The rs11098403 is located in the vicinity of the gene encoding N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (heparan glucosaminyl) 3, (NDST3). This study aimed to replicate the results in a Han Chinese population and then potentially extend these findings. We performed a two-stage study to investigate the association of NDST3 with the schizophrenia and BD risk in the Han Chinese. In stage 1, a total of 632 patients with schizophrenia, 654 patients with BD and 684 healthy controls were recruited from the Shanghai region. In stage 2, 522 schizophrenia patients and 547 normal subjects were enrolled from the Hangzhou region. Then, we conducted a meta-analysis based on the present literature. In stage 1, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11098403 showed a significant association with schizophrenia (corrected P=0.005). The frequency of the rs11098403 G allele was significantly lower among schizophrenia patients than among the controls (odds ratio (OR)=0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.55-0.84, corrected P=0.002). No significant difference was observed in individual SNP marker genotypes or allele distributions between the BD and control groups. In stage 2, the association of rs11098403 with schizophrenia could be validated (genotypic P=0.001 and allelic P=0.0003). After pooling all data from 1861 patients with schizophrenia and 2081 controls, we observed a significant association of the rs11098403 G allele with schizophrenia (Z=5.56, P<0.001), with an OR=0.70 (95% CI: 0.61-0.79). Then, we performed an expression quantitative trait loci analysis to investigate the functional effect of rs11098403 on NDST3 expression in the brain. We observed a significant association of rs11098403 with NDST3 expression in the hippocampus (P=0.027), although the significance did not survive after multiple testing correction. Our findings provided preliminary evidence that rs11098403 might modify the genetic risk of schizophrenia in the Han Chinese. Further investigations are warranted to identify the precise mechanism regulating brain NDST3 expression in the Han Chinese. These results would help to explain the pathophysiological mechanism of schizophrenia."
26728569,26728569,Common variants on 17q25 and gene-gene interactions conferring risk of schizophrenia in Han Chinese population and regulating gene expressions in human brain.,"Recently, two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of schizophrenia (SCZ) in Han Chinese identified several susceptibility loci. Replication efforts aiming to validate the GWAS findings were made and focused on the top hits. We conducted a more extensive follow-up study in an independent sample of 1471 cases and 1528 matched controls to verify 26 genetic variants by including nine top single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that reached genome-wide significance and 17 promising SNPs nominated in the initial discovery phase. rs8073471 in an intron of tubulin-folding cofactor D (TBCD) obtained nominal significance (P<0.01) in single SNP analysis. Logistic regression identified significant interaction between rs3744165 (5'-untranslated region variant of exon 2 of zinc finger protein 750 (ZNF750), and in an intron of TBCD) and rs8073471 (Deviance test P-value=2.77 × 10(-34)). Both SNPs are located at 17q25, an interesting region that has been implicated in SCZ. By using the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data set, we implemented an expression quantitative trait loci epistasis analysis to explore the association between the genotype combinations of the two SNPs and gene expression levels in 13 areas of human central nervous system. We observed that rs3744165 × rs8073471 interaction modulated the expression profile of TEAD3 (P=1.87 × 10(-8)), SH3TC2 (P=2.00 × 10(-8)), KCNK9 (P=5.20 × 10(-7)) and PPDPF (P=1.13 × 10(-6)) in postmortem cortex tissue; EFNA1 (P=7.26 × 10(-9)), RNU4ATAC (P=2.32 × 10(-8)) and NUPL2 (P=6.79 × 10(-8)) in cerebellum tissue. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first one that links TBCD and ZNF750 mutations to SCZ susceptibility and to the transcript levels in human brain tissues. Further efforts are needed to understand the role of those variants in the pathogenesis of SCZ."
26725554,26725554,Associations of Toll-like receptor 7 and 8 Polymorphisms with Asthma and Asthma-related Phenotypes in a Chinese Han Population.,"Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and 8 mediate anti-virus immunity and are of particular relevance to asthma. However, very little information about genetic association on TLR7/8 and asthma are available. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of polymorphisms in TLR7 and 8 on asthma risk and asthma-related phenotypes in a Chinese Han population. We enrolled 462 unrelated adult asthmatic patients and 398 healthy volunteers. The genotypes of tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR7 and 8 genes were determined using multiplex SNaPshot SNP genotyping assay. We used case-control and case-only studies to assess any links with asthma and asthma-related phenotypes. There was no association between the variants in TLR7 and 8 and asthma susceptibility. However, our results revealed that the genetic variants in TLR7 and 8 were associated with asthma-related phenotypes, including eosinophil counts, serum immunoglobulin E levels, lung function, and asthma severity as well. Our study suggests that TLR7 and 8 polymorphisms may play a considerable role in the pathogenesis of asthma. It will help in better understanding the pathogenesis of asthma and development of more effective strategies for asthma prevention, prediction, and therapy."
26728147,26728147,A complex role of anthrax toxin receptor 2 polymorphisms and capillary morphogenesis protein 2 in ankylosing spondylitis pathogenesis.,"This study investigated the role of anthrax toxin receptor 2 (ANTXR2) gene polymorphisms and capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2) expression in susceptibility and pathogenesis to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in the Han Chinese in Beijing. A case-control study was performed using 602 AS patient samples meeting the revised New York criterion and 619 matched controls from Han Chinese individuals. Nineteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ANTXR2 genes were selected and genotyped using the Sequenom iPlex platform. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry were performed to investigate the impact of SNP polymorphisms on ANTXR2 transcription and CMG2 expression, respectively. The association of variants with AS was examined with UNPHASED 3.1.5. A novel association was observed between AS and three SNPs in the ANTXR2 gene (rs4690127, rs6823031, and rs4333130; P = 0.004, 0.011, and 0.013, respectively), confirming the association between rs433130 and AS in the Han Chinese. The strongest haplotype association was observed with rs4690127-rs6823031-rs4333130 (P = 2.5 × 10(-4)). rs6534639 and rs4333130 showed a cis-interaction (P = 0.027) in AS. ANTXR2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was significantly higher in the AS group than in the control group (P = 0.039). CMG2 expression in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.018). This study reports a novel association between ANTXR2 and AS in the Han Chinese. ANTXR2 genetic polymorphisms affect ANTXR2 mRNA transcription and CMG2 expression. The opposing results observed for ANTXR2 transcription and CMG2 expression suggest a complex role of ANTXR2 polymorphisms in AS pathogenesis."
26725464,26725464,Large C9orf72 repeat expansions are seen in Chinese patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"An intronic GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) gene was considered as the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia in Caucasian populations. Using repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction analysis and Southern blotting methods, we assessed the frequency and size of hexanucleotide repeat expansion in a cohort of 918 sporadic ALS (SALS) patients and 632 control individuals of Han Chinese origin. We identified 8 (0.87%) of the SALS patients and none of control individuals as carriers of C9orf72 expansions with 700-3500 repeats. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery was conducted on 4 expansion-positive ALS patients, where 3 patients were found to have cognitive impairment. All expansion-positive patients were genotyped for the previously reported 20 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) risk haplotypes on chromosome 9p21. Among them, 13 SNP risk haplotypes were shared in all expansion carriers, suggesting a common founder from European ancestry. Further meta-analysis demonstrated that the intermediate expansion size with 24-30 repeats, rare in both patients and controls, were significantly associated with the risk for ALS. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify a proportion of Chinese SALS patients carrying this pathologic expansion of up to ∼3500 repeats and to completely elaborate the 20-SNP risk haplotypes in Chinese expansion-positive patients, providing indispensable evidence for the origin, geographical range, and population prevalence of the C9orf72-associated ALS."

26722545,26722545,Hsa-miR-449a genetic variant is associated with risk of gastric cancer in a Chinese population.,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies and one of the major causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In the present study, we investigated the association between miR-449a rs112310158 SNP and GC risk. Our findings revealed that a variant GG genotype increased the risk of occurrence of GC compared to a wild type AA genotype (OR = 2.542, 95% CI: 1.304-4.954, P = 0.005). Specifically, the G allele reduced the risk of occurrence of cervical cancer in women compared to the A allele (OR = 1.279, 95% CI: 1.012-1.617, P = 0.043). In conclusion, our findings suggest that miR-449a rs112310158 is a genetic risk factor for GC."

Recent genome-wide resequence studies identified a missense single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs58542926) of the transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2) gene in the NCAN-CILP2 region related to hepatic triglyceride content. This study aims to analyze the influences of SNPs in this region on NAFLD and plasma lipid levels in the Asian and Pacific ethnic groups and to reveal the reasons behind positive and negative genetic associations dependent on ethnicity.
26699338,26699338,Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1 (TRAF1) polymorphisms and susceptibility to autoimmune thyroid disease.,"Former studies have revealed the link between the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 1 (TRAF1) polymorphisms and autoimmunity. In the present study, we took an opportunity to investigate the association between TRAF1 and autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) in order to find a new susceptibility gene. A total of 1029 AITD patients [677 Graves' disease (GD) patients and 352 Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) patients] and 899 controls were enrolled. We used matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF-MS) to detect the polymorphisms of rs4836834, rs10760130, rs10818488, rs2239658, rs2900180. We also explored the association between polymorphisms and clinical subphenotypes. Genotype frequencies of the five loci in all AITD patients were significantly different from those of controls. Genotype frequencies of rs10760130, rs2239658 and rs2900180 in GD patients were significantly different from controls. Allele analysis found that T allele of rs4836834, G allele of rs10760130, A allele of rs10818488, T allele of rs2239658 and T allele of rs2900180 were significantly higher in GD and AITD patients. No significant differences were found between HT patients and controls. Haplotype analysis found three haplotypes including ACAGC, TTGAT and TCGAC. ACAGC frequencies were significantly lower in GD and HT patients. However, TTGAT frequency was only significantly higher in GD patients. No significant results were found between polymorphisms and clinical subphenotypes. Our study reveals TRAF1 as a susceptibility gene of AITD in Chinese Han population."
26722494,26722494,Association of the ARL15 rs6450176 SNP and serum lipid levels in the Jing and Han populations.,"The association of ADP-ribosylation factor-like 15 (ARL15) rs6450176 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and serum lipid profiles has never been studied in the Chinese population. The present study was undertaken to detect the association of ARL15 rs6450176 SNP and several environmental factors with serum lipid levels in the Jing and Han populations. Genotypes of the SNP were determined in 726 unrelated subjects of Jing nationality and 726 participants of Han nationality. The genotypic and allelic frequencies of the SNP in Jing but not in Han were different between males and females (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05; respectively). The G allele carriers in Han had lower serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein (Apo) B levels, and higher ApoA1/ApoB ratio than the G allele non-carriers (P < 0.05-0.01). The G allele carriers in Jing had lower serum TC, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), ApoA1, ApoB levels and higher ApoA1/ApoB ratio than the G allele non-carriers (P < 0.05 for all). Subgroup analyses showed that the G allele carriers had lower TC and LDL-C levels in Han males; lower LDL-C and ApoB levels in Han females; lower ApoB levels and ApoA1/ApoB ratio in Jing males; and lower LDL-C levels in Jing females than the G allele non-carriers (P < 0.05-0.01). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that serum TC, LDL-C, ApoB levels and the ApoA1/ApoB ratio in Han; and TC, HDL-C and ApoA1 levels in Jing were correlated with the genotypes of the ARL15 rs6450176 SNP (P < 0.05-0.001). Serum lipid parameters were also associated with several environmental factors in both ethnic groups. These findings indicated that there may be a racial/ethnic- and/or sex-specific association of the ARL15 rs6450176 SNP and serum lipid levels."

26693074,26693074,CHRNA5 polymorphisms and risk of lung cancer in Chinese Han smokers.,"Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer among men in many countries. It is the result of interactions between genetic and environmental factors, among which tobacco smoking is a key environmental factor. CHRNA5, Cholinergic Receptor, Neuronal Nicotinic, Alpha Polypeptide-5, was previously reported to be associated with lung cancer risk. To identify the genetic susceptibility and tobacco smoking that influence lung cancer risk in Han population, we performed a case-control study in 228 patients and 301 controls. These data were compared using the χ(2)-test, genetic model analysis, and haplotype analysis. rs495956, rs680244, rs601079, rs555018, 588765 and rs11637635 showed an increased risk of lung cancer in both allelic model and genetic mode analysis. The genotype G/A-A/A of rs11637635 was most strongly associated with a 2.17-fold increased risk of lung cancer in dominant model (p = 0.018). One SNP, rs684513, was associated with a 0.645-fold decreased risk (p = 0.033) in allelic model analysis. By haplotype association analysis, haplotype sequences CTTATCAAAGA and GA of CHRNA5 were found to be associated with a 2.03-fold and 1.91-fold increased lung cancer risk (p < 0.05). Our results, combined with those from previous studies, suggest that genetic variation in CHRNA5 may influence susceptibility to lung cancer among Han smokers."
26689701,26689701,A Polymorphism Within the 3'UTR of NLRP3 is Associated with Susceptibility for Ischemic Stroke in Chinese Population.,"Stroke was regarded as a severe disorder with high morbidity and high mortality worldwide, ischemic stroke (IS) accounts for 85 to 90 % of new increased stroke cases. Partial mechanisms were elucidated by genetic factors including genomic instability such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Previous reports demonstrated that inflammation was involved in IS, NLRP3 [nucleotide-binding domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3], acting as a specific inflammatory gene, however, its function and influence on IS was not well clarified. In this study, a case-control study including 1102 IS patients and 1610 healthy controls was conducted to investigate the association between IS susceptibility with a SNP (rs10754558) in 3'UTR of NLRP3. Logistic regression analysis showed that the heterozygote and the homozygote GG confer a significantly increased risk of CRC after controlling for other covariates (adjusted OR = 1.52, 95 % C.I. 1.19-1.97, P = 0.002; adjusted OR = 2.22, 95 % C.I. 2.18-3.67, P < 0.001, respectively). Carriage of G allele was associated with a greatly increased risk of developing the disease (OR = 1.69, 95 % C.I. 1.31-1.83, P < 0.001). Stratification analysis found that hypertension had interaction with rs10754558 to modulate IS risk. Further in vitro assay revealed that rs10754558 can affect mRNA level of NLRP3, suggesting its possible functional significance. Our data suggested that genetic polymorphisms in NLRP3 may influence IS risk in Chinese population. Replication of our studies in other populations and further functional studies are required for complete comprehension of the roles of NLRP3 polymorphisms in IS risk."
26683100,26683100,"Association study of polymorphisms in FOXO3, AKT1 and IGF-2R genes with human longevity in a Han Chinese population.","FOXO3, AKT1 and IGF-2R are critical members of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway. Previous studies showed that polymorphisms (SNPs) in FOXO3, AKT1 and IGF-2R were associated with human longevity in Caucasian population. However, the association of these SNPs in different ethnic groups is often inconsistent. Here, we investigated the association of genetic variants in three genes with human longevity in Han Chinese population. Twelve SNPs from FOXO3, AKT1 and IGF-2R were selected and genotyped in 1202 long-lived individuals (nonagenarians and centenarians) and younger individuals. Rs9486902 of FOXO3 was found to be associated with human longevity in both genders combined in this study (allelic P = 0.002, corrected P = 0.024). The other eleven SNPs were not significantly associated with human longevity in Han Chinese population. The haplotypes TTCTT, CCTTC and CTCCT of FOXO3 as well as GGTCGG and GGTCAG of AKT1 were shown to have a significant difference between case and control (P =0.006, 2.78×10-5, 4.68×10-6, 0.003,0.005, respectively). The estimated prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes in long-lived individuals was significantly lower than in common adult populations (P = 0.001, 2.3×10-26) .Therefore, the search for longevity-associated genes provides the identification of new potential targets beneficial for the treatment of diabetes."
26689687,26689687,Associations of Polymorphisms in MTHFR Gene with the Risk of Age-Related Cataract in Chinese Han Population: A Genotype-Phenotype Analysis.,"Homocysteine (Hcy) is a potential risk factor for age-related cataract (ARC). Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is the key enzyme for Hcy metabolism, and variants of MTHFR may affect MTHFR enzyme activity. This study mainly evaluated the associations between variants in MTHFR gene, plasma MTHFR enzyme activity, total Hcy (tHcy) levels and ARC risk in Chinese population. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MTHFR gene were genotyped using the high-resolution melting (HRM) method in 502 ARC patients (mean age, 70.2 [SD, 9.0], 46.0% male) and 890 healthy controls (mean age, 67.1 [SD, 11.1], 47.6% male). The plasma MTHFR activity, folic acid (FA), vitamins B12 and B6 levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The plasma tHcy levels were measured by an automated enzymatic assay. After the Bonferroni correction, the minor allele T of SNP rs1801133 showed a significant association with an increased risk of overall ARC (OR = 1.26, P = 0.003). Consistent association was also found between SNP rs1801133 and cortical ARC risk (OR = 1.44, P = 0.003). Haplotype analyses revealed an adverse effect of the haplotype ""C-A-T-C"" (alleles in order of SNPs rs3737967, rs1801131, rs1801133 and rs9651118) on ARC risk (OR = 1.55, P = 0.003). Moreover, in a joint analysis of SNPs rs9651118 and rs1801133, subjects with two unfavorable genotypes had a 1.76-fold increased risk of ARC compared with the reference group, and a statistically significant dose-response trend (Ptrend = 0.001) was also observed. Further, in healthy controls and patients with cortical ARC, the allele T of SNP rs1801133 and the increasing number of unfavorable genotypes were significantly correlated with decreased MTHFR activity as well as increased tHcy levels. However, there was no significant association between FA, vitamins B12, B6 levels and MTHFR variants. Our data indicated that variants in MTHFR gene might individually and jointly influence susceptibility to ARC by affecting MTHFR enzyme activity and tHcy levels."
26687183,26687183,A Novel Functional Polymorphism in the NINJ2 Promoter Predicts Risk of Large Artery Atherosclerotic Stroke.,"A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified two common polymorphisms (rs12425791 and rs11833579) on chromosome 12p13 that confer risk to stroke, particularly for large artery atherosclerotic (LAA) stroke. However, these two polymorphisms are located ∼11 kb upstream of the NINJ2 gene and their effects on NINJ2 expression have not been well characterized. Through linkage disequilibrium and fine-mapping analysis, we identified a novel functional polymorphism in the NINJ2 promoter (rs3809263 G > A) and examined its association with risk of LAA stroke in Chinese population. Rs3809263 was genotyped using the improved multiple ligase detection reaction in 414 patients with LAA stroke and 423 healthy controls. A significant decreased risk of LAA stroke was found for the rs3809263 GA (adjusted odd ratio [OR] = 0.63, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0.46-0.88) and AA (OR = 0.54, 95 % CI = 0.35-0.84) genotypes. Moreover, genotype-phenotype correlation analysis indicated that the AA genotype carriers had significantly increased NINJ2 mRNA expression levels in the Chinese population, suggesting that the rs3809263 G > A polymorphism is a functional SNP and a biomarker for risk of LAA stroke. Further validation of the functionality of the NINJ2 rs3809263 G > A polymorphism and its association with risk of LAA stroke in other ethnic populations is warranted."
26674772,26674772,Evidence for Association of Cell Adhesion Molecules Pathway and NLGN1 Polymorphisms with Schizophrenia in Chinese Han Population.,"Multiple risk variants of schizophrenia have been identified by Genome-wide association studies (GWAS). As a complement for GWAS, previous pathway-based analysis has indicated that cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) pathway might be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. However, less replication studies have been reported. Our objective was to investigate the association between CAMs pathway and schizophrenia in the Chinese Han population. We first performed a pathway analysis utilizing our previous GWAS data. The CAMs pathway (hsa04514) was significantly associated with schizophrenia using hybrid gene set-based test (P = 1.03×10-10) and hypergeometric test (P = 5.04×10-6). Moreover, 12 genes (HLA-A, HLA-C, HLA-DOB, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DRB1, MPZ, CD276, NLGN1, NRCAM, CLDN1 and ICAM3) were modestly significantly associated with schizophrenia (P<0.01). Then, we selected one promising gene neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) to further investigate the association between eight significant SNPs and schizophrenia in an independent sample (1814 schizophrenia cases and 1487 healthy controls). Our study showed that seven SNPs of NLGN1 and two haplotype blocks were significantly associated with schizophrenia. This association was confirmed by the results of combined analysis. Among them, SNP rs9835385 had the most significant association with schizophrenia (P = 2.83×10-7). Furthermore, in silico analysis we demonstrated that NLGN1 is preferentially expressed in human brain and SNP rs1488547 was related to the expression level. We validated the association of CAMs pathway with schizophrenia in pathway-level and identified one susceptibility gene NLGN1. Further investigation of the roles of CAMs pathway in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia is warranted."

26671509,26671509,"Association of the C2-CFB locus with non-infectious uveitis, specifically predisposed to Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease.","Complement component 2 (C2) and factor B (CFB) are regulators of complement system and involved in the alternative pathway, which have been identified to be associated with multiple immune-related diseases. This study aimed to investigate the association of these genes with non-infectious intermediate and posterior uveitis. A total of 260 Chinese non-infectious uveitis patients were recruited, including 97 patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH), 70 patients with intermediate uveitis (IU) and 93 patients with Behçet's disease (BD). Two hundred and ninety-three normal control subjects were also recruited. Five SNPs across the C2/CFB region were selected and genotyped using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays. Association analysis was adjusted for gender and stratified by different subtypes. The CFB SNP rs1048709 was significantly associated with non-infectious uveitis [P corr = 0.01, OR 1.49 (allele model) and P corr = 0.04, OR 1.58 (dominant model), respectively], and similar association was also detected between rs1048709 and female uveitis patients (P corr = 0.01, OR 1.70 and P corr = 0.049, OR 184, respectively). Moreover, subgroup analyses showed that CFB-rs1048709 was specifically associated with VKH, where significantly higher frequencies of A allele and AA homozygosity were observed in VKH patients compared with controls (P corr = 0.025 and P corr = 0.035, respectively), whereas none of these five SNPs was associated with IU or BD. In addition, a haplotype block across CFB (GTG) was significantly predisposed to uveitis with protective effect (OR 0.66, P corr = 0.048). Our results revealed a significant association of CFB with non-infectious uveitis, particularly predisposed to VKH disease. Genetic differences for uveitis could be gender-specific."

26668144,26668144,Single-nucleotide Polymorphism rs2275294 in ZNF512B is not Associated with Susceptibility to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in a Large Chinese Cohort.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects motor neurons and has no effective treatment. Recently, Iida et al. identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2275294 in the ZNF512B gene that is significantly associated with susceptibility to ALS in the Japanese population. Here, we performed a case-control study examining the possible association of rs2275294 with risk of sporadic ALS (SALS) in a large Chinese cohort."
26645718,26645718,Evaluation of potential regulatory function of breast cancer risk locus at 6q25.1.,"In a genome-wide association study conducted among Chinese women, we identified the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2046210 at 6q25.1 for breast cancer risk. To explore a potential regulatory role for this risk locus, we measured expression levels of nine genes at the locus in breast cancer tissue and adjacent normal tissue samples obtained from 67 patients recruited in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study. We found that rs2046210 had a statistically significant association with the expression levels of the AKAP12 and ESR1 genes in adjacent normal breast tissues. Women who carry the AA/AG risk genotypes had higher expressions of these two genes compared to those who carry G/G genotypes (P = 0.02 and 0.04 for the AKAP12 and ESR1, respectively). However, no significant differences of SNP rs2046210 with gene expression levels were found in tumor tissues. In The Cancer Genome Atlas samples, the AA/AG risk genotypes of SNP rs2046210 were associated with a significantly higher expression level of the AKAP12 gene and a lower level of the ESR1 gene in tumor tissue. Functional analysis using ENCODE data revealed that SNP rs7763637, which is in strong linkage disequilibrium with SNP rs2046210, is likely a potential functional variant, regulating the AKAP12 gene. Taken together, these results from our study suggest that the association between the 6q25.1 locus and breast cancer risk may be mediated through SNPs that regulate expressions of the AKAP12 gene."
26649038,26649038,Association Analysis of MET Gene Polymorphism with Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma in a Chinese Population.,"To investigate the association of MET SNPs with gender disparity in thyroid tumors, as well as the metastasis and prognosis of patients, 858 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 556 patients with nodular goiter, and 896 population-based normal controls were recruited. The genotyping of MET SNPs was carried out using the Sequenom MassARRAY system. The distribution of MET SNPs (rs1621 and rs6566) was different among groups. Gender stratification analysis revealed a significant association between the rs1621 genotype and PTC in female patients (P = 0.037), but not in male patients (P > 0.05). For female patients, the rs1621 AG genotype was significantly higher in patients with PTC than in normal controls (P = 0.01) and revealed an increasing risk of PTC (OR: 1.465, 95% CI: 1.118-1.92). However, association analysis of the rs1621 genotype with metastasis and prognosis revealed no significant correlation in both male and female patients. The findings of our study showed that polymorphism of SNP locus rs1621 in MET gene may be associated with gender disparity in PTC. Higher AG genotypes in rs1621 were correlated with PTC in female patients, but not in male patients."
26643990,26643990,Identification and SNP association analysis of a novel gene in chicken.,"A novel gene that was predicted to encode a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcript was identified in a previous study that aimed to detect candidate genes related to growth rate differences between Chinese local breed Gushi chickens and Anka broilers. To characterise the biological function of the lncRNA, we cloned and sequenced the complete open reading frame of the gene. We performed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to analyse the expression patterns of the lncRNA in different tissues of chicken at different development stages. The qPCR data showed that the novel lncRNA gene was expressed extensively, with the highest abundance in spleen and lung and the lowest abundance in pectoralis and leg muscle. Additionally, we identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the 5'-end of the gene and studied the association between the SNP and chicken growth traits using data from an F2 resource population of Gushi chickens and Anka broilers. The association analysis showed that the SNP was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with leg muscle weight, chest breadth, sternal length and body weight in chickens at 1 day, 4 weeks and 6 weeks of age. We concluded that the novel lncRNA gene, which we designated pouBW1, may play an important role in regulating chicken growth."

26655190,26655190,Significant association of GRM7 and GRM8 genes with schizophrenia and major depressive disorder in the Han Chinese population.,"Metabotropic glutamate receptor type 7 (GRM7) and type 8 (GRM8) are involved in the neurotransmission of glutamate which is supposed to play an important role in the development of schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorders (MDD). We designed this study to investigate whether common DNA variants or their genetic interactions within GRM7 and GMR8 genes were associated with these disorders in the Han Chinese population. Fourteen SNPs in GRM7 and GRM8 were selected within a sample set comprising 1235 SCZ patients, 1045 MDD patients and 1235 normal controls. Significant association in SCZ case-control subjects was observed for rs2229902 (permutated Pallele=0.0005, OR=1.492 [95% CI=1.231-1.807]) and rs9870680 (permutated Pallele=0.0023, OR=1.262 [95% CI=1.116-1.426]) in GRM7 and rs2237781 (permutated Pallele=0.0027, OR=1.346 [95% CI=1.149-1.575]) in GRM8. Association analysis for MDD case-control subjects revealed positive results in rs779706 (permutated Pallele=0.0099, OR=1.237 [95% CI=1.093-1.399]) of GRM7 and in rs1361995 (permutated Pallele=0.0017, OR=1.488 [95% CI=1.215-1.823]) of GRM8. Moreover, a three-locus model, constituted by polymorphisms in GRM7 and GRM8 significantly correlated with MDD in the gene-gene interaction analysis. Meta-analysis and haplotype analysis further confirmed our significant results. We demonstrated the genetic association of GRM7 and GRM8 with SCZ and MDD in the Han Chinese population. We also found susceptibility interactive effects of these two genes with both psychiatric disorders, which might provide new insights into the etiology of them."
26637467,26637467,Population Variation Reveals Independent Selection toward Small Body Size in Chinese Debao Pony.,"Body size, one of the most important quantitative traits under evolutionary scrutiny, varies considerably among species and among populations within species. Revealing the genetic basis underlying this variation is very important, particularly in humans where there is a close relationship with diseases and in domestic animals as the selective patterns are associated with improvements in production traits. The Debao pony is a horse breed with small body size that is unique to China; however, it is unknown whether the size-related candidate genes identified in Western breeds also account for the small body size of the Debao pony. Here, we compared individual horses from the Debao population with other two Chinese horse populations using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified with the Equine SNP 65 Bead Chip. The previously reported size-related candidate gene HMGA2 showed a significant signature for selection, consistent with its role observed in human populations. More interestingly, we found a candidate gene TBX3, which had not been observed in previous studies on horse body size that displayed the highest differentiation and most significant association, and thus likely is the dominating factor for the small stature of the Debao pony. Further comparison between the Debao pony and other breeds of horses from around the world demonstrated that TBX3 was selected independently in the Debao pony, suggesting that there were multiple origins of small stature in the horse."
26632884,26632884,A novel polymorphism near HLA class II region is associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV and response to interferon treatment in Chinese patients.,"A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) has identified the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4273729 in a 100-kbp region comprising human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) class II genes as an important predictor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) clearance in European and African populations. This study was to determine whether this polymorphism is also associated with spontaneous HCV clearance as well as response to interferon treatment in Chinese patients. Thus, 686 chronic HCV carriers, 432 individuals with spontaneous viral clearance and 243 patients with pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin (PEG IFN-α/RBV) treatment were genotyped. The rs4273729 GG genotype was strongly associated with spontaneous HCV clearance as well as better IFN/RBV treatment response compared with the GC/CC genotypes in Chinese Han population (additive model: odds ratio (OR)=0.62, 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=0.51-0.76; OR=0.58, 95% CI=0.38-0.88, respectively). Rs4273729, rs12980275, baseline HCV RNA and platelet level were independent predictors for sustained virological response (SVR). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.578 when including rs4273729 alone, but the prediction value was improved significantly (AUC=0.733) when further including rs12980275, baseline viral load and baseline platelet level. In conclusion, the genetic variation of rs4273729 is associated with clearance of HCV in both the natural course and the treatment process in Chinese Han population."
26629162,26629162,Lack of association between FOXO1 polymorphisms and bacteremia.,"Increasing evidence suggests that FOXO1, one critical gene related to the human immune system, probable is closely to the human infection. In the present study we aimed to investigate genetic association of FOXO1 with bacteremia in Han Chinese. 188 patients with bacteremia diagnosed with blood culture and 250 healthy blood donors without signs of infection were studied, two tagging SNPs of FOXO1 (rs9532571, rs3751436) were selected and genotyped using predesigned TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. The results showed that the allele frequency of rs9532571 and rs3751436 in FOXO1 was not associated with an increased risk of bacteremia (P=0.762, OR=1.05, 95% CI 0.77-1.43; P=0.059, OR=1.34, 95% CI 0.99-1.81 respectively), the genotype distribution of these two SNPs was also not significantly different between bacteremia patients and control groups (P=0.9; P=0.16). Haplotypes in this block were not significantly associated with bacteremia risk."
26635088,26635088,Discovery of a novel genetic susceptibility locus on X chromosome for systemic lupus erythematosus.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune connective tissue disease affecting predominantly females.

26629180,26629180,Identification of an SCLC susceptibility rs7963551 genetic polymorphism in a previously GWAS-identified 12p13.33 RAD52 lung cancer risk locus in the Chinese population.,"As a well-known DNA repair gene, RAD52 plays an essential role in homologous recombination repair of double strand break, maintenance of genomic stability and prevention of cell malignant transformation. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified common genetic variants at 12p13.33 RAD52 locus associated with lung cancer risk in Caucasians. However, little or nothing has been known about the RAD52 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in the Chinese population. As a result, we examined the association between six RAD52 SNPs (rs10849605, rs1051669, rs10774474, rs11571378, rs7963551 and rs6489769) and SCLC susceptibility in Chinese. After 520 SCLC cases and 1040 controls in two independent case-control sets were genotyped, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by logistic regression. We found that only the RAD52 rs7963551 SNP was significantly associated with SCLC risk among six RAD52 SNPs genotyped. The odds of having the rs7963551 CA genotype in SCLC patients was 0.38 (95% CI = 0.24-0.62, P = 1.1×10(-4)) compared with the CC genotype. Stratified analyses of association between rs7963551 SNP and SCLC risk indicated that the functional polymorphism was only significantly associated with decreased risk among smokers but not nonsmokers. Our results demonstrated that the functional RAD52 rs7963551 SNP contributes to susceptibility to developing SCLC in the Chinese population."
26629128,26629128,CD36 genotype associated with ischemic stroke in Chinese Han.,"CD36 is involved in oxidant stress, hyperlipidemia, and thrombosis in the pathology of stroke. CD 36 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were reported to be associated with abnormalities of serum FA, triglyceride level and to increase risk of metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. Based on these finding we hypothesized that CD36 is an important candidate gene of stroke; therefore, we set out a case-control study to explore the association of CD36 SNPs with ischemic stroke."
26629209,26629209,Genetic association analysis between polymorphisms of HAIRY-AND-ENHANCER-OF SPLIT-7 and congenital scoliosis.,"We explored the association between genetic polymorphisms of HAIRY-AND-ENHANCER-OF-SPLIT-7 (HES7) and congenital scoliosis (CS) in 246 cases of congenital scoliosis and non-congenital controls, in which the age and sex were fully matched. All participants were Chinese Han population."
26678516,26678516,Variant rs2237892 of KCNQ1 Is Potentially Associated with Hypertension and Macrovascular Complications in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in A Chinese Han Population.,"KCNQ1 has been identified as a susceptibility gene of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Asian populations through genome-wide association studies. However, studies on the association between gene polymorphism of KCNQ1 and T2DM complications remain unclear. To further analyze the association between different alleles at the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2237892 within KCNQ1 and TD2M and its complications, we conducted a case-control study in a Chinese Han population. The C allele of rs2237892 variant contributed to susceptibility to T2DM (odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-1.75). Genotypes CT (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.24-3.15) and CC (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.57-3.95) were associated with an increased risk of T2DM. Multivariate regression analysis was performed with adjustment of age, gender, and body mass index. We found that systolic blood pressure (P=0.015), prevalence of hypertension (P=0.037), and risk of macrovascular disease (OR, 2.10; CI, 1.00-4.45) were significantly higher in subjects with the CC genotype than in the combined population with genotype either CT or TT. Therefore, our data support that KCNQ1 is associated with an increased risk for T2DM and might contribute to the higher incidence of hypertension and macrovascular complications in patients with T2DM carrying the risk allele C though it needs further to be confirmed in a larger population."
26629024,26629024,The miR-149 rs2292832 T/C polymorphism may decrease digestive cancer susceptibility: an updated meta-analysis.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short non-coding, single stranded RNAs, which perform post-transcriptional regulatory functions as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRs genes are currently being identified for contributing to cancer risk, prognosis and survival, however, an association between miR-149 rs2292832 T/C SNP and cancer risk is uncertain. Therefore, we performed an updated meta-analysis of all currently publications to clarify this relationship. From PubMed and Chinese language (WanFang) databases, we located articles published up to June 1, 2015, obtaining 21 case-control studies from 20 different articles containing 8913 cases and 9944 controls based on search criteria for cancer susceptibility related to the miR-149 rs2292832 T/C SNP. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) revealed association strengths. There had no association between this SNP and whole cancer risk. At the same time, in several subgroups, also no association was found in ethnicity, sex and smoking status. Nevertheless, poorly significant association was detected in cancer type (Digestive cancer: OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.81-1.00, Pheterogeneity = 0.142 for CT vs. TT) and source of control (population-based: OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.00-1.32, Pheterogeneity = 0.427 for CC vs. CT+TT) subgroups. The miR-149 rs2292832 T/C SNP may poorly decrease digestive cancer risk. Studies with larger samples and gene-environment interactions are warranted to understand the role of miR-149 polymorphisms, especially rs2292832 T/C SNP, in whole cancer risk."
26623033,26623033,Association between nm23 gene polymorphisms and the risk of endometriosis.,"The first tumor metastasis-suppressor gene, nm23, may have an important role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis (EM). The present study aimed to evaluate whether nm23 gene polymorphisms are correlated with the risk of the development of EM in North Chinese women, as a preliminary study. The case-control study was conducted with 379 EM patients and 384 unrelated healthy controls. Genotyping of two polymorphisms within the nm23 gene promoter region (rs16949649 T/C and rs2302254 C/T) were performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The data showed that the rs16949649 and rs2302254 polymorphisms within the nm23 gene were not associated with the risk of developing EM. There were no statistical differences in the distribution of nm23 genotypes between patients with EM and the control group (P=0.490 and P=0.440, respectively). For the rs16949649 T/C, compared with the C/T + T/T genotype, the C/C genotype did not increase the risk of EM [odds ratio (OR)=0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.57-1.17]. For the rs2302254 C/T, compared with the C/T + C/C genotype, the T/T genotype did not increase the risk of EM (OR=1.46; 95% CI, 0.81-2.64). In conclusion, the findings in the present pilot study suggest that nm23 polymorphisms do not contribute to EM susceptibility. However, more studies in larger populations are required to confirm these results."

The aim of the study was to replicate the association of IL23R-C1orf141 and ADO-ZNF365-EGR2 with VKH syndrome in four sets of multinational populations in Asia.
26618050,26618050,Relationship between CYP17A1 Genetic Polymorphism and Essential Hypertension in a Chinese Population.,"The relationship between CYP17A1 genetic polymorphisms and essential hypertension (EH) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of CYP17A1 genetic polymorphisms with EH in Han and Uighur populations in China. A Han population including 558 people (270 EH patients and 288 controls) and a Uighur population including 473 people (181 EH patients and 292 controls) were selected. Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs4919686, rs1004467, rs4919687, rs10786712, and rs2486758) were genotyped using real-time PCR (TaqMan). In the Uighur population, for the total and the men, rs4919686, rs4919687 and rs10786712 were found to be associated with EH (rs4919686: P≤0.02, rs4919687: P≤0.002, rs10786712: P≤0.004, respectively). The difference remained statistically significant after the multivariate adjustment (all P<0.05). The overall distributions of the haplotypes established by SNP1-SNP3, SNP1-SNP4, SNP1-SNP3-SNP5 and SNP1-SNP4-SNP5 were significantly different between the EH patients and the control subjects (for the total: P=0.013, P=0.008, P=0.032, P=0.010, for men: P<0.001, P=0.001, P=0.010, P=0.00). In the Han population, for men, rs2486758 was found to be associated with EH in a recessive model (P=0.007); the significant difference was not retained after the adjustment for the covariates (date not shown). The A allele of rs4919686 could be a susceptible genetic marker, and the T allele of rs10786712 could be a protective genetic marker of EH. The AC genotype of rs4919686, the AG genotype of rs4919687 and the TT genotype of rs10786712 could be protective genetic markers of EH."
26617899,26617899,Association of NER pathway gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to laryngeal cancer in a Chinese population.,"We systematically analyzed the association of nine SNPs of seven key NER pathway genes with the development of laryngeal cancer patients, and investigated whether NER pathway polymorphisms could serve as potential biomarkers for laryngeal cancer risk. 271 patients with pathologically proven laryngeal cancer and 271 control subjects were included in our study. Genotyping of ERCC1 rs11615 and rs2298881, ERCC2 rs13181 and rs50871, ERCC3 rs4150441, ERCC4 rs6498486, ERCC5 rs2094258, XPA rs2808668 and XPC rs2228001 were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). By conditional logistic regression analysis, individuals carrying the TT genotype of ERCC1 rs11615 were correlated with an increased risk of larynx cancer when compared with the CC genotype (OR=1.89, 95% CI=1.07-3.37; P value=0.02). Moreover, individuals with the GG genotype of ERCC2 rs50871 were associated with an elevated risk of larynx cancer when compare with the TT genotype (OR=2.03, 95% CI=1.15-3.63; P value=0.01). We found a significant interaction between ERCC2 rs50871 polymorphism and tobacco smoking in the risk of larynx cancer (P for interaction <0.05). In conclusion, our study showed that ERCC1 rs11615 and ERCC2 rs50871 polymorphisms could influence the risk of larynx cancer in Chinese population, particularly among smokers."
26617759,26617759,Association of genetic polymorphisms on BTNL2 with susceptibility to and prognosis of dilated cardiomyopathy in a Chinese population.,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one type of primary myocardial disease, partly caused by immunity dysfunctions. BTNL2 (butyrophilin-like 2) has already been confirmed to be involved in the etiology of autoimmune disorders and GWAS (genome wide association study) has also identified mutants of a SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) near BTNL2 could modulate risk of coronary heart disease (also cardiomyopathy). The current study, therefore, was aimed to investigate whether polymorphisms within or around BTNL2 would be correlated with susceptibility to and prognosis of DCM."
26597478,26597478,Association between microRNA-499 polymorphism and gastric cancer risk in Chinese population.,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in microRNAs are related to the occurrence, development and prognosis of cancer. The aim of the present study is to investigate the possible influence of the miR-499(rs3746444) polymorphism on the risk of gastric cancer in Chinese population. A total of 363 GC patients and 969 cancer-free controls were enrolled in this study. The genotypes were obtained using MassARRAY method. The results showed that, compared with T allele, C allele was associated with a significantly increased risk of GC (OR=1.491, 95% CI=1.155-1.923, P=0.002). Moreover, a significantly increased risk of GC in subjects with the TC genotype was observed (adjusted OR of 1.559, 95% CI=1.148-2.117, P=0.004), compared with the wide type TT. We also found that basically dominant model (TT vs. TC+CC) was suitable for the association between rs6513497 and the risk of GC (OR=1.568, 95% CI=1.173-2.097, P=0.002). However, the same association was also shown in males and females. Meanwhile, rs3746444 was associated with the tumor size of GC patients. The present study indicated that miR-499 rs3746444 might contribute to GC risk and this SNP could be developed as a biomarker for GC prediction."
26605328,26605328,Association of the NOTCH4 Gene Polymorphism rs204993 with Schizophrenia in the Chinese Han Population.,"NOTCH4 regulates signaling pathways associated with neuronal maturation, a process involved in the development and patterning of the central nervous system. The NOTCH4 gene has also been identified as a possible susceptibility gene for schizophrenia (SCZ). The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between NOTCH4 polymorphisms and SCZ in the Chinese Han population. The rs2071287 and rs204993 polymorphisms of the NOTCH4 gene were analyzed in 443 patients with SCZ and 628 controls of Han Chinese descent. Single SNP allele-, genotype-, and gender-specific associations were analyzed using different models (i.e., additive, dominant, and recessive models). This association study revealed that the rs204993 polymorphism is significantly associated with susceptibility for SCZ and that the AA genotype of rs204993 is associated with a higher risk for SCZ (P = 0.027; OR = 1.460; 95% CI, 1.043-2.054). Our data are consistent with those obtained in previous studies that suggested that rs204993 is associated with SCZ and that the AA genotype of rs204993 demonstrates a higher risk. Further large-scale association analyses in Han Chinese populations are warranted."
26608415,26608415,Unique genetic alterations and clinicopathological features of hepatocellular adenoma in Chinese population.,"Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is a benign hepatocyte-derived tumor commonly seen in reproductive-aged women with long-term use of oral contraceptives (OCs) in European and North American countries. Accordingly, HCA is currently classified into four molecular subtypes as adopted by the World Health Organization. The present study was firstly to characterize and determine the genetic alterations and clinicopathological features of the largest series of HCAs in China. We reviewed 189 patients with HCA who underwent hepatectomies at our liver center from January 1984 to January 2012, among which 36 HCAs were randomly selected for the sequencing of HNF1α, β-catenin and gp130 genes, and 60 HCAs were randomly selected for detecting microsatellite instability (MSI). Compared with Western studies, our data showed distinctive findings including male (69.8%) and overweight/obese (50.3%) predominance. Only 3.5% of female patients had a documented history of OCs use for 2-4 years. All 36 sequenced HCAs showed HNF1α mutations (72% missense, 28% synonymous), 2 hotspot polymorphisms of HNF1α (I27L: rs1169288 and S487N: rs2464196) were seen in 17 (47%) and 10 (27.8%) cases, respectively, and a novel single nucleotide polymorphism site (rs1169304) in intron 9 of HNF1α was detected in 32 (88%) cases, but no β-catenin or gp130 gene mutation was detected, and no nuclear β-catenin staining was detected by immunohistochemistry. The frequency of MSI was 75% for D12S1398 (HNF1α inactivated pathway) and 78.5% for D6S1064 (HIPPO signaling pathway) in 34 overweight/obese patients with HCA. Our results firstly indicate that patients with HCA in China frequently occur in male overweigh and obese adult population, lack an association with OCs use and exhibit unique genetic alterations. Taken together, these observations suggest that alternative pathogenetic pathways involve in HCA tumorigenesis in Chinese patients."

A couple of studies have explored the association between vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to AITDs in different populations and found conflicting results. This case-control study was designed to evaluate the role of polymorphisms of VDR gene in the predisposition of AITDs in a Chinese Han population."
26615418,26615418,Association between interleukin 8 -251 A/T and +781 C/T polymorphisms and osteosarcoma risk in Chinese population: a case-control study.,"Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is an angiogenic chemokine that plays a potent role in both development and progression of many human malignancies. However, there are no data about the role of IL-8 polymorphism in development of osteosarcoma. A hospital-based case-control study was conducted among 190 patients with osteosarcoma and 190 healthy controls to investigate the possible association between the IL-8 -251 A/T and +781 C/T polymorphisms, respectively, and the risk of osteosarcoma. Significant differences of genotype distribution were observed between osteosarcoma cases and controls at the IL-8 -251T/A genotypes. Compared with the IL-8 -251T/A homozygote TT, the heterozygous TA genotype was associated with significantly increased risk for osteosarcoma (odds ratio (OR) = 2.16, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = (1.38-4.52), P = 0.021); the AA genotype was associated with increased risk for osteosarcoma (OR = 1.94, 95 % CI = 1.31-3.83, P = 0.018). TA and AA combined variants were associated with increased risk for osteosarcoma compared with the TT genotype (OR = 1.72, 95 % CI = 1.45-4.41, P = 0.023). Moreover, the genotype AA of IL-8 -251T/A carried a higher risk of osteosarcoma metastasis and later Enneking stages, compared with the TT genotype. However, the genotype and allele frequencies of IL-8 +781 C/T polymorphisms in osteosarcoma patients were not significantly different from controls. Our results showed that the IL-8 -251 A/T genotype was associated with increased risk for development and metastasis of osteosarcoma in Chinese Han population."
26572640,26572640,Common Polymorphisms Within QPCT Gene Are Associated with the Susceptibility of Schizophrenia in a Han Chinese Population.,"A recent genome-wide association study conducted in Caucasians has identified glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase (QPCT) gene as a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia, as its common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2373000 was significantly associated with the risk of this disease. To date, this finding has not been validated in other populations or ethnic groups. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of common SNPs spanning QPCT gene with the susceptibility of schizophrenia in a Han Chinese population comprising 440 schizophrenia patients and 450 control subjects. A total of 6 tagSNPs including rs2373000 was selected and then genotyped in our sample. Although the relation between rs2373000 and the risk of schizophrenia was not successfully replicated, we showed for the first time that the minor allele (C) of rs3770752 was associated with a reduced risk of schizophrenia (odds ratio (OR) = 0.645; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.486-0.855; P"
26613934,26613934,Case-control study on association of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-δ and SNP-SNP interactions with essential hypertension in Chinese Han population.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the association of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-δ (PPAR-δ) and additional SNP-SNP interaction with essential hypertension (EH) in Chinese Han population. A total of 1248 subjects (625 males, 623 females), including 620 EH patients and 628 normotension subjects, were included in the study. The mean age was 51.2 ± 15.1 years old. Logistic regression model was used to examine the association between four SNP and EH; odds ratio (OR) and 95% confident interval (95%CI) were calculated. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) was employed to analyze SNP-SNP interaction. EH risk was significantly lower in carriers of C allele of the rs2016520 polymorphism than those with TT (TC + CC versus TT, adjusted OR (95%CI) = 0.61 (0.49-0.78)). In addition, we also found a significant association between rs9794 and EH; EH risk was also significantly lower in carriers of G allele of the rs9794 polymorphism than those with CC (CG + GG versus CC, adjusted OR (95%CI) = 0.65 (0.53-0.83)). We also found a potential SNP-SNP interaction between rs2016520 and rs9794; subjects with TC or CC of rs2016520 and CG or GG of rs9794 genotype have the lowest EH risk, compared to subjects with TT of rs2016520 and CC of rs9794 genotype; OR (95%CI) was 0.32 (0.23-0.62) after covariate adjustment. Our results support an important association between rs2016520 and rs9794 minor allele of PPAR-δ and decreased risk of EH and additional interaction between rs2016520 and rs9794."

26563375,26563375,Association and interaction of NFKB1 rs28362491 insertion/deletion ATTG polymorphism and PPP1R13L and CD3EAP related to lung cancer risk in a Chinese population.,"The nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells 1 (NFKB1) gene encodes p105 and p50 kD which are both subunits of the transcription factor NF-kB, involved in a wide variety of diseases and pathological states associated with inflammation, immunity, and tumorigenesis. The NFKB1 rs28362491 polymorphism in the promoter region (-94 insertion/deletion ATTG) has been associated with risk of various cancers. Our study aims were to evaluate the associations of NFKB1 rs28362491 polymorphism and interactions of this single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and PPP1R13L and CD3EAP and smoking duration in relation to lung cancer risk in a Chinese population. The study population consisted of 544 Chinese lung cancer cases and 550 cancer-free matched (age, sex, and ethnicity) controls. No associations were found between NFKB1 rs28362491 and lung cancer risk. CD3EAP rs967591 was associated with increased lung cancer risk in the dominant model [OR (95 % CI) = 1.38 (1.05-1.80), P = 0.018]. The common haplotype containing PPP1R13L rs1970764(G), CD3EAP rs967591(A), and CD3EAP rs735482(C) was associated with lung cancer [adjusted OR (95 % CI) = 1.29 (1.03-1.62), P = 0.028]. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis revealed two-way and three-way interactions between CD3EAP rs735482 and smoking and between NFKB1 rs28362491, PPP1R13L rs1970764, and smoking. In conclusion, we were able to reproduce previously found associations between PPP1R13L and CD3EAP polymorphisms and lung cancer risk in an increased study group, and we found interactions between NFKB1 rs28362491-PPP1R13L rs1970764 and smoking duration and between CD3EAP rs735482 and smoking duration. These results suggest that these genes and smoking are part of the same biological pathway leading to smoking-induced lung cancer."

In this study, we investigated whether polymorphisms in the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) gene are associated with susceptibility to PE in the Chinese Han population."
26566276,26566276,Genetic Evidence for Possible Involvement of the Calcium Channel Gene CACNA1A in Autism Pathogenesis in Chinese Han Population.,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders. Recent studies suggested that calcium channel genes might be involved in the genetic etiology of ASD. CACNA1A, encoding an alpha-1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channel, has been reported to play an important role in neural development. Previous study detected that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in CACNA1A confers risk to ASD in Central European population. However, the genetic relationship between autism and CACNA1A in Chinese Han population remains unclear. To explore the association of CACNA1A with autism, we performed a family-based association study. First, we carried out a family-based association test between twelve tagged SNPs and autism in 239 trios. To further confirm the association, the sample size was expanded to 553 trios by recruiting 314 additional trios. In a total of 553 trios, we identified association of rs7249246 and rs12609735 with autism though this would not survive after Bonferroni correction. Our findings suggest that CACNA1A might play a role in the etiology of autism."
26552012,26552012,Chromatin remodeling gene EZH2 involved in the genetic etiology of autism in Chinese Han population.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of severe neurodevelopmental disorders. Epigenetic factors play a critical role in the etiology of ASD. Enhancer of zest homolog 2 (EZH2), which encodes a histone methyltransferase, plays an important role in the process of chromatin remodeling during neurodevelopment. Further, EZH2 is located in chromosome 7q35-36, which is one of the linkage regions for autism. However, the genetic relationship between autism and EZH2 remains unclear. To investigate the association between EZH2 and autism in Chinese Han population, we performed a family-based association study between autism and three tagged single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that covered 95.4% of the whole region of EZH2. In the discovery cohort of 239 trios, two SNPs (rs740949 and rs6464926) showed a significant association with autism. To decrease false positive results, we expanded the sample size to 427 trios. A SNP (rs6464926) was significantly associated with autism even after Bonferroni correction (p=0.008). Haplotype G-T (rs740949 and rs6464926) was a risk factor for autism (Z=2.655, p=0.008, Global p=0.024). In silico function prediction for SNPs indicated that these two SNPs might be regulatory SNPs. Expression pattern of EZH2 showed that it is highly expressed in human embryonic brains. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that EZH2 might contribute to the genetic etiology of autism in Chinese Han population."
26550313,26550313,Predictive and prognostic molecular markers for cholangiocarcinoma in Han Chinese population.,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is the most common malignant heterogeneous polygenetic carcinoma with a high incidence in Asia. Most patients would die within 1 year after diagnosis and the 5 year survival rate is less than 10-20% worldwide. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes regulate telomere maintenance, mitosis, and inflammation, and may help predict individual susceptibility to certain drugs, environmental factor, and risks to particular diseases. The gene-gene interaction and the regulation of SNPs have not been assessed extensively in CCA. According to our previous study, the GRB2-associated-binding protein (Gab1) gene rs3805246 (X(2) =5.015, P=0.025, OR=0.531, 95% CI 0.304-0.928) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene rs2007000 (X(2) =7.934, P=0.005, OR=2.148, 95% CI 1.255-3.675) presented significant difference between CCA patients and controls. This study conducted a population-based analysis using 225 CCA cases (153 biliary tract cancer patients and 72 gall bladder cancer patients) to assess the association between SNPs and progression of CCA patients, including the overall survival and the prognosis analysis. Results showed that an increased susceptibility of BTC was significantly associated with SNP loci distribution frequency in EGFR rs2107000 (X(2) =7.934, P=0.005, OR=2.148, 95% CI 1.255-3.675). Furthermore, multivariate factor regression analysis represented cholelithiasis medical history of BTC patients can be an effective evaluation criteria of BTC susceptibility in early stage. This study also assessed the relationship between these genotypic polymorphisms and clinicopathologic data, including tumor differentiation stage and overall survival. This is the first study identifying that EGFR polymorphisms are associated with BTC and EGFR rs2017000 polymorphisms may be an important survival predictor in BTC patients."

While there are increasing evidences to suggest that lysosomal enzyme defects and Parkinson's disease (PD) have strong associations, and recently, SMPD1 p.L302P (c.T911C, NM_000543) was found to be a risk factor for PD in Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry population, we try to investigate the possible association between SMPD1 p.L302P and sporadic PD in ethnic Chinese population."
26547792,26547792,Polymorphisms in lncRNA HOTAIR and susceptibility to breast cancer in a Chinese population.,"Controversial data have emerged on the association between cancer risk and the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs920778C>T) in Hox transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR). No data on the association between HOTAIR polymorphism and breast cancer (BC) susceptibility and reproductive factors have been reported in China. In this study we investigated the association between HOTAIR polymorphisms and BC susceptibility in a population-based case-control study of 502 cases and 504 matched controls in China. Three haplotype tagging SNPs (rs1899663, rs4759314, rs920778) of HOTAIR were genotyped with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and created-restriction-site PCR (CRS-RFLP) assays. False-positive report probability (FPRP) was calculated to test for false-positive associations. Interactions between the SNPs and reproductive factors were further evaluated by the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method. BC risk reduction was confined to subgroups of age at menarche >14 (OR: 0.42, 95%CI: 0.21, 0.82) and number of pregnancies >2 (OR: 0.65, 95%CI: 0.49, 0.95) for GT+TT rs1899663, and age at menopause ≤ 50 (OR: 0.97, 95%CI: 0.84, 0.99) for AG+GG rs4759314. Subjects with Trs920778 had a significantly increased risk of breast cancer (OR: 1.41, 95%CI: 1.13, 1.75). We observed a significant interaction between rs920778 and reproductive factors, including age at menopause, number of abortions, and family history. Our results were unlikely to be false positives according to FPRP calculation. In conclusion, genetic variant rs920778 in HOTAIR significantly increased the risk of BC, and it may have apparent interaction with reproductive factors in the progression on BC. These findings extend available data on the association between HOTAIR polymorphisms and BC susceptibility."
26568273,26568273,Endochondral ossification pathway genes and postmenopausal osteoporosis: Association and specific allele related serum bone sialoprotein levels in Han Chinese.,"Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and disrupted bone architecture, predisposing the patient to increased fracture risk. Evidence from early genetic epidemiological studies has indicated a major role for genetics in the development of osteoporosis and the variation in BMD. In this study, we focused on two key genes in the endochondral ossification pathway, IBSP and PTHLH. Over 9,000 postmenopausal Han Chinese women were recruited, and 54 SNPs were genotyped. Two significant SNPs within IBSP, rs1054627 and rs17013181, were associated with BMD and postmenopausal osteoporosis by the two-stage strategy, and rs17013181 was also significantly associated with serum IBSP levels. Moreover, one haplotype (rs12425376-rs10843047-rs42294) covering the 5' end of PTHLH was associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Our results provide evidence for the association of these two key endochondral ossification pathway genes with BMD and osteoporosis in postmenopausal Han Chinese women. Combined with previous findings, we provide evidence that a particular SNP in IBSP has an allele-specific effect on mRNA levels, which would, in turn, reflect serum IBSP levels."
26523551,26523551,Association of methionine synthase gene polymorphisms with wool production and quality traits in Chinese Merino population.,"Methionine synthase (MTR) plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis of intracellular methionine, folate, and homocysteine, and its activity correlates with DNA methylation in many mammalian tissues. Our previous genomewide association study identified that 1 SNP located in the gene was associated with several wool production and quality traits in Chinese Merino. To confirm the potential involvement of the gene in sheep wool production and quality traits, we performed sheep tissue expression profiling, SNP detection, and association analysis with sheep wool production and quality traits. The semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis showed that the gene was differentially expressed in skin from Merino and Kazak sheep. The sequencing analysis identified a total of 13 SNP in the gene from Chinese Merino sheep. Comparison of the allele frequencies revealed that these 13 identified SNP were significantly different among the 6 tested Chinese Merino strains ( < 0.001). Linkage disequilibrium analysis showed that SNP 3 to 11 were strongly linked in a single haplotype block in the tested population. Association analysis showed that SNP 2 to 11 were significantly associated with the average wool fiber diameter and the fineness SD and that SNP 4 to 11 were significantly associated with the CV of fiber diameter trait ( < 0.05). Single nucleotide polymorphism 2 and SNP 5 to 12 were weakly associated with wool crimp. Similarly, the haplotypes derived from these 13 identified SNP were also significantly associated with the average wool fiber diameter, fineness SD, and the CV of fiber diameter ( < 0.05). Our results suggest that is a candidate gene for sheep wool production and quality traits, and the identified SNP might be used in sheep breeding."
26541596,26541596,Association of genetic polymorphisms in PTEN and additional gene-gene interaction with risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in Chinese Han population.,"This study aims to investigate the association of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) gene and additional role of gene-gene interaction with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), based on a Chinese case-control study. A total of 871 subjects (420 males and 451 females) were selected, including 425 ESCC cases and 446 controls. Five SNPs were selected for genotyping in the case-control study: rs2735343, rs555895, rs2299939, rs17431184 and rs701848. Logistic regression model was used to examine the association between five SNP and ESCC, and additional interaction among five SNP, odds ratio (OR) and 95% confident interval (95%CI) were calculated. All genotypes were distributed according to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls. The carriers of homozygous mutant of rs2735343 and rs701848 polymorphism revealed increased ESCC risk than those with wild-type homozygotes, and OR (95%CI) were 1.27 (1.09-2.08) and 1.45 (1.17-1.98), respectively. We also found a potential gene-gene interaction between rs2735343 and rs701848 (P = 0.0010), and a potential gene-gene interaction among all five SNP (P = 0.0107) after covariates adjustment. Subjects with TC or CC of rs2735343 and TC or CC of rs701848 genotype have highest ESCC risk, compared to subjects with TT of rs2735343 and TT of rs701848 genotype, OR (95% CI) was 2.76 (1.37-3.45) after covariates adjustment. The carriers of homozygous mutant of rs2735343 and rs701848 polymorphism revealed increased ESCC risk. We also found a potential gene-gene interaction between rs2735343 and rs701848 and a potential gene-gene interaction among all five SNPs."

However, there are no data about the role of MMP polymorphism in the development of cervical cancer. A hospital-based case-control study was conducted in 230 patients with cervical cancer and 230 healthy controls to investigate the possible association between the MMP2 rs243865, MMP3 rs3025058, MMP7 rs11568818, and MMP9 rs3918242 polymorphisms, respectively, and the risk of cervical cancer. Our results suggested that the MMP2 rs243865-1306 C/T was significantly associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer (CT vs. CC, OR = 1.46; 95 % CI 1.18-3.55; P = 0.032; TT vs. CC, OR = 1.72; 95 % CI 1.28-4.02; P = 0.031; CT + TT vs. CC, OR = 1.43; 95 % CI 1.21-3.44; P = 0.029). Similarly, the MMP7 rs11568818-181A/G genotypes can also elevate the risk of cervical cancer in all genetic models. However, the genotype and allele frequencies of MMP3 rs3025058 and MMP9 rs3918242 polymorphisms in cervical cancer patients were not significantly different from controls. Further analysis showed MMP2 rs243865 and MMP7 rs11568818 genotypes were associated with advanced tumor stages of cervical cancer patients. More interestingly, the MMP2 rs243865 and MMP7 rs11568818 genotype was statistically significantly associated with a poor survival in cervical cancer patients. Our results showed that the MMP2 rs243865 and MMP7 rs11568818 genotypes e were associated with increased susceptibility and development of cervical cancer in Chinese Han population."

26543236,26543236,Risk prediction for sporadic Alzheimer's disease using genetic risk score in the Han Chinese population.,"More than 30 independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in European. We aimed to confirm these SNPs in Chinese Han and investigate the utility of these genetic markers. We randomly divided 459 sporadic AD (SAD) patients and 751 cognitively normal controls into two sets (discovery and testing). Thirty-three SAD risk-associated SNPs were firstly tested in the discovery set. Significant SNPs were used to calculate genetic risk score (GRS) in the testing set. Predictive performance of GRS was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). In the discovery set, 6 SNPs were confirmed (P = 7.87 x 10(-11)~0.048), including rs9349407 in CD2AP, rs11218343 in SORL1, rs17125944 in FERMT2, rs6859 in PVRL2, rs157580 and rs2075650 in TOMM40. The first three SNPs were associated with SAD risk independent of APOE genotypes. GRS based on these three SNPs were significantly associated with SAD risk in the independent testing set (P = 0.002). The AUC for discriminating cases from controls was 0.58 for GRS, 0.60 for APOE, and 0.64 for GRS and APOE. Our data demonstrated that GRS based on AD risk-associated SNPs may supplement APOE for better assessing individual risk for AD in Chinese."
26536629,26536629,Correlations between ASCC3 Gene Polymorphisms and Chronic Hepatitis B in a Chinese Han Population.,"We have previously identified 8 SNPs in Han Chinese HBV carriers that are associated with disease progression. Although not well studied, genetic factors may also play a significant role in developing chronic HBV disease after exposure. We extend the effect of these eight SNPs on persistent HBV infection in this study. A total of 875 unrelated Han Chinese, 493 chronic hepatitis B subjects (CHB) and 382 HBV clearance individuals (Clear), were recruited from Hubei Province from September 2007 to March 2010. SNPs were verified by using TaqMan 7900HT Sequence Detection System. By using multiple logistic regression analysis, each of the 8 SNP associations was tested using 3 different genetic models (Dominant, Recessive and Additive model), in 4 types of analyses (full sample, men, women, age stratified). A Bonferroni correction was used to account for multiple statistical tests for each SNP association (P<0.05/8 = 0.0063). A significant correlation was observed at SNP rs10485138 located in ASCC3 gene in female patients (OR, 0.445; 95% CI, 0.253-0.784; P = 0.005). Females bearing C allele infected by HBV had an increased susceptibility to CHB compared with those T allele carriers. Our results indicated that SNP rs10485138 located in ASCC3 gene was associated with persistent HBV infection in Han Chinese."

The contribution of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to preterm RDS differs between ethnicities and remains unclear in Chinese infants. This study evaluated whether common SNPs and consequent haplotypes increase susceptibility to RDS in a population of preterm infants from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China.
26546898,26546898,Plasma Adiponectin Concentrations and Adiponectin Gene Polymorphisms Are Associated with Bronchial Asthma in the Chinese Li Population.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical significance of changes in the plasma adiponectin concentration in patients with bronchial asthma and to test the association between the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2241766 and rs1501299 in the ADIPOQ gene and bronchial asthma in the Chinese Li population. We selected 120 cases and 120 controls, and plasma adiponectin, interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, we genotyped two tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) and evaluated their association with bronchial asthma using the χ2 test and genetic model analysis. Compared to controls, patients with acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma showed significantly lower adiponectin and significantly higher IL-6 and TNF-α levels (p<0.01). A positive association was found between the rs1501299 SNP and acute exacerbation (OR=1.62; 95% CI=1.08-2.43; p=0.019). The inverse correlation between the plasma adiponectin concentration and asthma exacerbation indicates that adiponectin may play a protective role in the pathogenesis of asthma.

26506822,26506822,Genetic variation in the ABCG2 gene is associated with gout risk in the Chinese Han population.,"Gout is a common type of arthritis that is characterized by hyperuricemia, tophi, and joint inflammation. Current evidence suggests that heredity contributes to the progression of gout. Previous studies have shown that regulation of the ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) pathways plays a role in gout occurrence. To investigate and validate potential genetic associations with the risk of gout, we conducted a case-control study. We conducted 143 cases and 310 controls and genotyped seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ABCG2 gene. ABCG2 SNP association analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 Statistical Package, PLINK Software, HaploView software package, and SHEsis software platform. We identified that four susceptibility SNPs were potentially associated with occurrence of gout. Rs2622621 and rs3114018 in ABCG2 can actually increase the risk of gout in log-additive model (rs2622621, odds ratio (OR) = 1.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-2.61, p < 0.001; rs3114018, OR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.13-2.13, p = 0.006). We found that rs17731799G/T-G/G and rs3114020 T/C-T/T in ABCG2 can actually increase the risk of gout in dominant model (rs17731799, OR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.05-2.66, p = 0.028; rs3114020, OR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.00-2.51, p = 0.048). The ABCG2 haplotype ""GGCTCTC"" (OR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.75, p = 0.0019) decreased the gout risk. Our results, combined with those from previous studies, suggest that genetic variation in ABCG2 may influence gout susceptibility in the Han population."
26505452,26505452,Polymorphic variations in manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) genes contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Chinese Han population.,"Impaired antioxidant defense increases the oxidative stress and contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). MnSOD and eNOS are important antioxidant enzymes. This aim of this study was to verify the association of MnSOD and eNOS tagSNPs with T2DM in a Chinese Han population. Four tagSNPs of MnSOD and eight tagSNPs of eNOS were detected using TaqMan technology in 1272 healthy controls and 1234 T2DM patients. All study participants were unrelated members of the Han ethnic group in China. In this study, the frequency of the rs4880 MnSOD single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) genotype differed significantly between T2DM patients and controls [allele: P = 0.03, genotype: P = 0.04, odd's ratio (OR) = 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07-1.49]. The A-T haplotype and G-T haplotype remained significant in T2DM after Bonferroni correction (P = 1.58 x 10(-6) and 8.00 x 10(-4), respectively) with a global p-value of 7.25 x 10(-8). The rs1799983 and rs891512 SNPs of eNOS differed significantly between T2DM patients and controls [rs1799983: corrected allele: P = 2.10 x 10(-3), corrected genotype: P = 6.30 x 10(-3), OR = 1.43 (95%CI = 1.18-1.73); rs891512, corrected allele: P = 3.50 x 10(-3), corrected genotype: P = 9.10 x 10(-3), OR = 1.70 (95%CI = 1.26-2.30)]. Following Bonferroni correction, none of the haplotypes of eNOS were significant in T2DM. These results indicate that common variants in MnSOD and eNOS increased the risk of T2DM in the Chinese Han population."
26505415,26505415,Variations in WNT3 gene are associated with incidence of non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate in a northeast Chinese population.,"Non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) is a common birth defect. Several WNT genes are involved in craniofacial embryogenesis, and therefore may play an important role in the etiology of NSCL/P. Two SNPs (rs3809857 and rs9890413) in the WNT3 gene were subjected to case-control and case-parent analysis by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in 236 unrelated patients with NSCL/P, including 128 elementary families (185 mothers and 154 fathers), and 400 control individuals from northeast China. The rs3809857 SNP, under the assumption of a dominant model, was found to induce a 2-fold lower risk of NSCL/P ORGG vs GT + TT = 0.605, 95%CI = 0.436-0.839, P = 0.003). Moreover, the family-based association test revealed an under-transmission for the minor allele T. On the other hand, we observed a significant association in the case-control and case-parent analysis of the SNP rs9890413. In addition, the P values for the haplotype of rs3809857-rs9890413 were observed to be statistically significant (P = 0.004). In conclusion, our study confirmed the association between the WNT3 variant and NSCL/P in the population tested."

In this study, we investigated the association between the VDR single nucleotide polymorphism rs2228570 and CP susceptibility in a Han Chinese population consisting of 440 moderate or severe CP patients and 324 controls. Genomic DNA was extracted from buccal epithelial cells and genotyped using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometry. No significant difference in allelic or genotypic frequencies distributions for rs2228570 was found between CP patients and controls. In conclusion, we found no statistically significant association between rs2228570 and CP in our population."
26503210,26503210,Interleukin 10 gene -1082A/G polymorphism is associated with osteosarcoma risk and poor outcomes in the Chinese population.,"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a multifunctional cytokine that participates in the development and progression of various malignant tumors. However, data regarding the role of IL-10 polymorphisms in osteosarcoma development are not available. A case-control study was conducted in 260 patients with osteosarcoma and 260 healthy controls to investigate the possible association between IL-10 polymorphisms and the risk of osteosarcoma. Our results indicate the IL-10 -1082A/G (rs1800896) polymorphism is significantly associated with an increased risk of osteosarcoma in all genetic models (AG vs. AA, odds ratio (OR) = 1.56; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.28-2.32, P = 0.017; GG vs. AA, OR = 1.62, 95 % CI 1.24-2.61, P = 0.013; AG + GG vs. CC, OR = 1.76, 95 % CI = 1.31-3.01, P = 0.019). However, the genotype and allele frequencies of IL-10 -819C/T (rs1800871) and -592A/C (rs1800872) polymorphisms in osteosarcoma patients did not significantly differ from controls. Further analyses revealed that the IL-10 -1082A/G (rs1800896) genotypes were associated with advanced tumor stages and metastasis in osteosarcoma patients. Additionally, a statistically significant association between the IL-10 -1082A/G (rs1800896) genotype and poor survival in osteosarcoma patients was observed. Our results demonstrate that the IL-10 -1082A/G (rs1800896) genotype is associated with an increased susceptibility and worse outcome for osteosarcoma patients in the Chinese Han population."

26496256,26496256,Association Study between an SNP in CD147 and Its Expression With Acute Coronary Syndrome in a Jiangsu Chinese Population.,"CD147 is an important molecule in the inflammation and proteolysis process. This molecule crucially contributes to the initial and progression of atherosclerotic lesions. A single nucleotide polymorphism in CD147 gene, the rs8259 T/A in the 3'-untranslated region, is responsible for its expression in various cells. This study assessed whether the genetic variation rs8259 is associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and CD147. A total of 943 ACS subjects and 439 stable angina subjects, and 851 controls were genotyped for rs8259 polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA-sequencing method. Plasma soluble CD147 (sCD147) level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CD147 mRNA and protein expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were tested by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot, respectively. We found that TT genotype and T-allele frequency of CD147 rs8259 in ACS patients were much lower than the other patient groups. Significant difference was not observed between stable angina and controls. CD147 T allele was negatively related to ACS. ACS patients exhibited the highest CD147 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma sCD147 level. The plasma sCD147 levels in the culprit vessel were higher than those in the radial artery. In ACS patients, AA gene carriers had the highest CD147 levels, whereas TT gene carriers had the lowest CD147 levels. Linear regression analysis showed that genotypes and disease conditions contributed 49% to the change of the plasma CD147 level. These results suggested that the single nucleotide polymorphism of CD147 gene rs8259 T/A was associated with ACS susceptibility. Allele T gene may decrease the relative risk of suffering from ACS through downregulation of CD147 expression."
26505368,26505368,Association of a miR-34b binding site single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene with susceptibility to male infertility.,"This study aims to explore the possible associations between a genetic variation in the miR-34b binding site in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene (rs55763075) with male infertility in a Chinese population. Genotype distributions of the rs55763075 single nucleotide polymorphism were investigated by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing in a Chinese cohort that included 464 infertile men with idiopathic azoospermia or oligospermia and 458 controls with normal fertility. Overall, no significant differences in the distributions of the genotypes of the MTHFR rs55763075 polymorphism were detected between the infertility and control groups. A statistically significant increased risk of male infertility was found for carriers of the rs55763075 AA genotype when compared with homozygous carriers of the rs55763075 GG genotype in the azoospermia subgroup (OR = 1.721; 95% CI = 1.055-2.807; P = 0.031). Furthermore, we found that rs55763075 was associated with folate and homocysteine levels in patients with idiopathic azoospermia. Our results indicated that the MTHFR 3'-UTR rs55763075 polymorphism might modify the susceptibility to male infertility with idiopathic azoospermia."
26475999,26475999,Interaction between peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and smoking on cardiovascular disease.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the association between peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) genotype and additional gene-smoking interaction on cardiovascular disease (CVD) based on a Chinese population. A total of 1248 subjects (613 men, 635 women), with a mean age of 55.5±11.8 years old, were selected, including 620 CVD patients and 628 normal controls. Logistic regression was performed to investigate association between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and CVD. Generalized MDR (GMDR) was used to analysis the gene-environment interaction, cross-validation consistency, the testing balanced accuracy, and the sign test, to assess each selected interaction were calculated. The carriers of homozygous mutant of two SNP revealed increased CVD risk than those with wild-type homozygotes, OR (95% CI) were 1.31 (1.16-1.95) and 1.68 (1.29-2.06), respectively. GMDR analysis for one- to three-locus models indicated that there was a significant two-locus model (p=0.0107) involving rs1805192 and smoking, indicating a potential gene-gene interaction between rs1805192 and smoking. Overall, the two- locus models had a cross-validation consistency of 10 of 10, and had the testing accuracy of 62.17%. We found that smokers with Pro/Ala or Ala/Ala genotype have highest CVD risk, compared to non-smokers with Pro/Pro genotype, OR (95% CI) was 3.46 (1.31-3.42), after covariates adjustment. We found a significant association between genotypes of variants in rs10865710 and rs1805192 with increased CVD risk and a potential gene-gene interaction between rs1805192 and smoking."
26492838,26492838,Common variants in QPCT gene confer risk of schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population.,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a common and severe mental disorder, its etiology has not been elucidated completely. In one previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) of SCZ in the Caucasian population, the QPCT has been reported as susceptible gene for SCZ. The QPCT gene encodes Glutaminyl cyclase (QC), an enzyme which is involved in the post translational modification by converting N-terminal glutamate of protein to pyroglutamate, which is resistant to protease degradation, more hydrophobic, and prone to aggregation and neurotoxic. To further investigate the role of this gene in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population, we conducted this study in 1,248 (Mean age ± S.D, 36.44 years ± 9.0) SCZ cases, 1,248 (Mean age ± S.D, 30.62 years ± 11.35) healthy control samples for a case control study. We genotyped six SNPs in this study, including one positive SNP of the previous study, using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform. We found that rs2373000 was significantly associated with SCZ before correction [rs2373000: P allele = 0.016, χ(2)  = 5.784, OR [95%CI] = 0.861 [0.762-0.972], P genotype = 0.018, χ(2)  = 0.069]. After permutation correction for multiple testing, rs2373000 [rs2373000: P Allele corrected = 0.063, P genotype corrected = 0.069] showed marginal association with SCZ. Additionally, one pathogenic haplotype (TGT) containing rs2373000 was also significantly associated with SCZ. Our results are consistent with the findings of previous study and the genetic risk of QPCT gene for SCZ also exists in the Han Chinese population."
26495885,26495885,Association between ADAMTS-4 gene polymorphism and lumbar disc degeneration in Chinese Han population.,"Low back pain (LBP) is a common health problem and many LBP are caused by lumbar disc degeneration (LDD). ADAMTS-4 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs-4), also known as aggrecanse-1, plays a core role in degeneration of extracellular matrix in LDD. To investigate the association between ADAMTS-4 genetic polymorphism and LDD, we genotyped SNPs in and around ADAMTS-4. We recruited 482 sporadic cases of LDD and 496 healthy controls from Chinese Han population. Five SNPs were selected and phenotyped by the Sequenom MassARRAY system. Allelic, genotypic, and haplotypic association was performed. Rs4233367 (c.1877 C>T), which located in exon of ADAMTS-4 showed significant association with LDD. The T allele conferred a lower risk of LDD with an OR of 0.69 and TT genotype is at nearly one-fifth of the risk compared to CC genotype. Other tested SNPs didn't show significant difference between the case and control groups. The SNP rs4233367 in the exon of ADAMTS-4 gene may be associated with lumbar disc degeneration. © 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

26488483,26488483,Characterization of Sugarcane Mosaic Virus Scmv1 and Scmv2 Resistance Regions by Regional Association Analysis in Maize.,"Sugarcane Mosaic Virus (SCMV) causes one of the most severe virus diseases in maize worldwide, resulting in reduced grain and forage yield in susceptible cultivars. In this study, two association panels consisting of 94 inbred lines each, from China and the U.S., were characterized for resistance to two isolates: SCMV-Seehausen and SCMV-BJ. The population structure of both association panels was analyzed using 3072 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The Chinese and the U.S. panel were both subdivided into two sub-populations, the latter comprised of Stiff Stalk Synthetic (SS) lines and Non Stiff Stalk Synthetic (NSS). The relative kinships were calculated using informative 2947 SNPs with minor allele frequency ≥ 5% and missing data ≤ 20% for the Chinese panel and 2841 SNPs with the same characteristics were used for the U.S. panel. The Scmv1 region was genotyped using 7 single sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers, and 12 SSR markers were used for the Scmv2 region in the U.S. panel, while 5 of them were used for the Chinese panel. For all traits, a MLM (Mix Linear Model) controlling both population structure and relative kinship (Q + K) was used for association analysis. Three markers Trx-1, STS-11, and STS-12 located in the Scmv1 region were strongly associated (P = 0.001) with SCMV resistance, and explained more than 16.0%, 10.6%, and 19.7% of phenotypic variation, respectively. 207FG003 located in the Scmv2 region was significantly associated (P = 0.001) with SCMV resistance, and explained around 18.5% of phenotypic variation."

26474561,26474561,The association of CD40 polymorphisms with CD40 serum levels and risk of systemic lupus erythematosus.,"Current evidence shows that the CD40-CD40 ligand (CD40-CD40L) system plays a crucial role in the development, progression and outcome of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The aim of this study was to investigate whether a CD40 gene single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with SLE and CD40 expression in the Chinese population. We included controls (n = 220) and patients with either SLE (n =205) in the study."
26468016,26468016,Single nucleotide polymorphism rs11669203 in TGFBR3L is associated with the risk of neuroblastoma in a Chinese population.,"With a primary mortality, neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood. Amplification of the MYCN (v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene neuroblastoma derived homolog) oncogene is observed in 20-30 % of NB cases, a feature which also characterizes a highly aggressive subtype of the disease. However, the systematic study of association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MYCN-regulated genes and the risk of NB has not been investigated. In the current study, we scanned a set of 16 SNPs located within known or predicted MYCN binding sites in a cohort of 247 patients of Chinese origin with neuroblastic family tumors, including neuroblastoma (NB), ganglioneuroma (GN), and ganglioneuroblastoma (GNB), and in 290 cancer-free controls to determine whether any of the tested SNPs are associated with neuroblastic family tumors. We found that the rs11669203 G>C polymorphism, located in TGFBR3L promoter, is significantly associated with the risk of NB. Further, we found that this association is site specific to adrenal NB compared to non-adrenal NB. In addition, transcriptome analysis indicated that increased expression of TGFBR3L is strongly correlated with poor survival. The SNP rs11669203 located at the MYCN binding site of TGFBR3L is significantly associated with elevated risk of NB, and abnormal MYCN-regulated TGFBR3L expression may contribute to NB oncogenesis."
26464718,26464718,Possible involvement of single nucleotide polymorphisms in anti-Müllerian hormone signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of early OHSS in Han Chinese women.,"To investigate the possible relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) signaling pathway and the incidence of early OHSS, the genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes of 122 participants (62 patients with early OHSS and 60 patients without OHSS who underwent IVF/ICSI), and SNPs of the AMH and AMHR2 exons were detected directly. Further more, genotype distribution and allele frequency were analyzed. We found seven types of SNPs in the AMH exons, and two of them were missense mutations (rs10407022 and rs182295886). However, these two missense mutations did not increase the risk of early OHSS (rs10407022, P=0.307, OR=1.552, CI 0.668, 3.608; rs182295886, P=0.442, OR=0.359, CI 0.026, 4.883). While it was observed that participants with the SNP (rs10407022) had a relatively higher ovarian response than those without the SNP. Further more, we did not find any SNPs in exons of AMHR2. In conclusion, we analyzed the pathogenesis of OHSS by first investigating the SNPs in the AMH signaling pathway. There is no association between SNPs in the AMH/AMHR2 signaling pathway and early OHSS in Han Chinese women."
26474411,26474411,Association of SNPs in EGR3 and ARC with Schizophrenia Supports a Biological Pathway for Schizophrenia Risk.,"We have previously hypothesized a biological pathway of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity proteins that addresses the dual genetic and environmental contributions to schizophrenia. Accordingly, variations in the immediate early gene EGR3, and its target ARC, should influence schizophrenia susceptibility. We used a pooled Next-Generation Sequencing approach to identify variants across these genes in U.S. populations of European (EU) and African (AA) descent. Three EGR3 and one ARC SNP were selected and genotyped for validation, and three SNPs were tested for association in a replication cohort. In the EU group of 386 schizophrenia cases and 150 controls EGR3 SNP rs1877670 and ARC SNP rs35900184 showed significant associations (p = 0.0078 and p = 0.0275, respectively). In the AA group of 185 cases and 50 controls, only the ARC SNP revealed significant association (p = 0.0448). The ARC SNP did not show association in the Han Chinese (CH) population. However, combining the EU, AA, and CH groups revealed a highly significant association of ARC SNP rs35900184 (p = 2.353 x 10(-7); OR [95% CI] = 1.54 [1.310-1.820]). These findings support previously reported associations between EGR3 and schizophrenia. Moreover, this is the first report associating an ARC SNP with schizophrenia and supports recent large-scale GWAS findings implicating the ARC complex in schizophrenia risk. These results support the need for further investigation of the proposed pathway of environmentally responsive, synaptic plasticity-related, schizophrenia genes."

26452339,26452339,Genetic variant in DIP2A gene is associated with developmental dyslexia in Chinese population.,"Increasing evidence suggests that there is a substantial heritable component including several risk loci and candidate genes for developmental dyslexia (DD). DIP2A has been identified to be partially deleted on chromosome region 21q22.3, which cosegregates with DD. And it fits into a theoretical molecular network of DD implicated in the development of DD. Compared with some DD candidate genes that have been extensively studied (e.g., DYX1C1, DCDC2, KIAA0319, and ROBO1), very little is known about the association between candidate gene DIP2A and DD susceptibility. And given the linguistic and genetic differences between Chinese and other Western populations, it is worthwhile validating the association of DIP2A in Chinese dyslexic children. Here, we investigated two genetic variants, selected by bioinformatics analysis, in DIP2A in a Chinese population with 409 dyslexic cases and 410 healthy controls. We observed a significantly increased DD risk associated with rs2255526 G allele (OR = 1.297, 95% CI = 1.036-1.623, Padjusted  = 0.023) and GG genotypes (OR = 1.833, 95% CI = 1.043-3.223, Padjusted  = 0.035), compared with their wild-type counterparts. In addition, it was marginally significantly associated with DD under the recessive model (OR = 1.677, 95% CI = 0.967-2.908, Padjusted  = 0.066) and the dominant model (OR = 1.314, 95% CI = 0.992-1.741, Padjusted  = 0.057). However, we found no evidence of an association of SNP rs16979358 with DD. In conclusion, this study showed that a genetic variant in the DIP2A gene was associated with increased DD risk in China."
26448018,26448018,Variants in Vitamin D Binding Protein Gene Are Associated With Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.,"To investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 4 representative genes (VDR, GC, CYP2R1, and CYP24A1) encoding the core proteins involved in vitamin D production, degradation, and ligand-dependent signaling pathway are associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in a Chinese population. A total of 1494 pregnant Han Chinese women (692 women with GDM and 802 women with normal glucose served as controls) were recruited through a 2-step approach. Participants were further divided into 2 groups according to body mass index before gestation (pre-BMI) (25 kg/m2). Nine SNPs (rs3733359, rs2282679, and rs16847024 in GC, rs2060793 and rs10741657 in CYP2R1, rs2248359 and rs6013897 in CYP24A1, rs11574143 and rs739837 in VDR) were genotyped using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. The relationships between genotypes/alleles of a single locus as well as haplotypes of each gene and GDM were analyzed. We did not observe a significant difference in genotype frequency of each SNP between cases and controls. However, in the obese subgroup (pre-BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2), the risk allele-A of rs3733359 showed an association with increased risk of GDM (OR = 1.739, 95% CI = 1.066-2.837, P = 0.027). The GG-haplotype frequency of rs3733359 and rs2282679 in GC was modestly lower in the GDM group (OR = 0.848, 95% CI = 0.719-0.999, P = 0.048). Rs2060793 and rs10741657 were associated with insulin area under the curve (P = 0.028, P = 0.042, respectively), while rs739837 and rs6013897 demonstrated a correlation with fasting glucose (P = 0.019, P = 0.049, respectively). Additionally, rs2248359 displayed an association with leukocyte counts (B = 0.063 P = 0.033) and rs16847024 was related to high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (B = 0.086, P = 0.005). Our results indicate an association between GC variants and GDM, as well as a relation between a subset of loci in CYP2R1, CYP24A1, and VDR and clinical parameters related to GDM. Our findings may provide information for identifying biomarkers for early risk prediction of GDM and the pathways involved in disease progression."

26448013,26448013,"High Incidence of Malaria Along the Sino-Burmese Border Is Associated With Polymorphisms of CR1, IL-1A, IL-4R, IL-4, NOS, and TNF, But Not With G6PD Deficiency.","Malaria is highly endemic in Yunnan Province, China, with the incidence of malaria being highest along the Sino-Burmese border. The aim of our study was to determine whether genetic polymorphisms are associated with the prevalence of malaria among Chinese residents of the Sino-Burmese border region. Fourteen otherwise healthy people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, 50 malaria patients, and 67 healthy control subjects were included in our cross-sectional study. We analyzed the frequency of the G3093T and T520C single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CR1. Logistic regression was used to calculate the prevalence odds ratio (POR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of malaria for the T520C SNP of CR1 and SNPs of G6PD, IL-4, IL-4R, IL-1A, NOS, CD40LG, TNF, and LUC7L. The frequency of the 3093T/3093T genotype of CR1 in the malaria group (0.16) was significantly higher than that in the control group (0.045, P < 0.05), and significantly lower than that in the G6PD deficiency group (0.43, P < 0.01). The frequency of the 520T/520T genotype of CR1 was significantly higher in the malaria patients (0.78) than that in the control group (0.67, P < 0.05) and G6PD-deficiency group (0.36, P < 0.05). The T allele of the T520C variant of CR1 was significantly associated with the prevalence of malaria (POR: 1.460; 95% CI: 0.703-3.034). Polymorphisms of G6PD did not significantly influence the prevalence malaria (P > 0.05). A GTGTGTC haplotype consisting of IL-1A (rs17561), IL-4 (rs2243250), TNF (rs1800750), IL-4R (rs1805015), NOS (rs8078340), CD40LG (rs1126535), and LUC7L (rs1211375) was significantly associated with the prevalence of malaria (POR: 1.822, 95% CI: 0.998-3.324). The 3093G/3093G and 520T/520T genotypes are the predominant genetic variants of CR1 among Chinese residents near the Sino-Burmese border, and the T allele of T520C is associated with the prevalence of malaria in this region. Although G6PD deficiency does not protect against malaria, it may diminish the association between malaria and the CR1 polymorphisms in this population. The GTGTGTC haplotype is also associated with the prevalence of malaria in this region."
26429306,26429306,Contribution of dendritic cell immunoreceptor (DCIR) polymorphisms in susceptibility of systemic lupus erythematosus and primary Sjogren's syndrome.,"Dendritic cell immunoreceptor (DCIR) has previously shown an association with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Caucasians and Han Chinese. This study was aimed to further investigate whether DCIR polymorphisms are novel susceptibility factors for other autoimmune diseases, i.e. systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS). A total of 1502 patients with SLE, 476 patients with primary SS, and 1278 non-related healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2377422 and rs10840759 were genotyped using TaqMan assay. The differences in allelic and genotypic distribution between two groups were assessed using Pearson chi-square test, and logistic regression adjusting for age and sex, respectively. P-value < 0.025 was considered statistically significant by Bonferroni correction. The SNP rs2377422 confers an increased susceptibility risk to both SLE (allele model: P = 7.65 × 10(-4), OR 1.20; genotype recessive model: P = 0.012, OR 1.29), and primary SS (allele model: P = 3.74 × 10(-4), OR 1.31; genotype dominant model: P = 1.62 × 10(-4), OR 2.02). There is no association between rs10840759 and SLE or primary SS. In conclusion, DCIR SNP rs2377422 is a novel genetic susceptibility factor for both SLE and primary SS."

26436404,26436404,Analysis of the association between polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene and dental caries in a Chinese population.,"Environmental influences on the development and progression of dental caries are well known; however, there is little evidence of a genetic component imparting susceptibility to dental caries. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between a single nucleotide polymorphism in the vitamin D receptor TaqI locus and dental caries susceptibility in a Chinese population. This case-control study was conducted with a case group (264 patients with dental caries from northwestern China) and a control group (219 individuals without dental caries or systemic disease from the same area). DNA was extracted from the peripheral venous blood of the study participants; the distribution of TaqI locus genotypes and allele frequencies was determined via polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The data obtained were statistically analyzed using the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Chi-square test. The frequency of the Tt genotype in the case group (14.0%) was significantly higher than that in the control group (4.3%), as determined using the genotype TT as the reference. The risk of dental caries was increased 3.8-fold in individuals with the heterozygous Tt genotype compared to that in the individuals with the TT genotype. The proportion of the 't' allele in the case group (7.0%) and the control group (2.1%) was observed to be significantly different [P = 0.0003; OR = 3.592, confidence interval 95% (1.790-7.208)]. Our results therefore suggested that the allele 't' might be a genetic factor determining dental caries susceptibility in individuals from the northwest of China."

The objectives of this study were to detect polymorphisms of BMPER gene in four indigenous Chinese cattle populations and to investigate their effects on body size traits. Initially, three SNPs, namely G100597A (SNP1), C105331A (SNP2), and G105521A (SNP3) and eight distinct haplotypes were identified. In a total of 12 SNP-SNP combinations, SNP2-SNP3 had a strong linkage in Qinchuan cattle. These four cattle populations belong to intermediate genetic diversity at three SNP loci except Shuxuan cattle population in SNP3. At SNP1, genotype AA was associated with an increased body size. For SNP2, the heterozygous genotype individuals had a greater rump length than those of two other homozygotic genotypes. At SNP3, individuals with GG genotype had smaller rump length and hip width. A total of seven haplotype combinations were detected in Qinchuan cattle population and association analysis results showed individuals with Haplotype combination 4/2 (AAA/CAA) had greater rump length than those with Hap3/1 and Hap3/3 (P < 0.05).

26408209,26408209,Common variants of HTR1A and SLC6A4 confer the increasing risk of Schizophrenia susceptibility: A population-based association and epistasis analysis.,"Schizophrenia (SZ) is a complex psychiatric disorder strongly influenced by genetic variants, some of which are associated with mood disorders. The neurotransmitter 5-hydoxytryptamine (5-HT) and its related biochemical factors have been shown to play a significant role in maintaining mood balance. Recent studies evaluating the association between SZ and genetic polymorphisms in a serotonin transporter (encoded by SLC6A4) and serotonin receptor 1A (encoded by HTR1A) show conflicting results. In this study, we performed a case-control association analysis using 4,000 individuals with Chinese-Han ancestry. Of these participants, 1,000 were SZ cases and 3,000 were healthy controls. Thirty-six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in SLC6A4 and HTR1A were genotyped in our 4,000 study samples. Of those, 33 polymorphic SNPs with a minor allele frequency >0.05 were used for further analysis. We found that rs878567 in HTR1A (asymptotic P-value = 3.89×10(-4) , corrected P-value = 0.0106) was significantly associated with SZ. Further haplotype-based analyses revealed that a two-SNP haplotype, rs2054847-rs140701 (TG) in gene SLC6A4, was significantly associated with SZ (P-value = 1.63×10(-4) and corrected P-value = 0.002799). We did not identify any significant epistatic interactions between the two genes. Our findings provide supportive evidence that genetic polymorphisms in SLC6A4 and HTR1A may influence the risk of SZ in Han Chinese individuals. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

The purpose of our study is to assess the contribution of GALNT2 rs4846914, APOE rs429358, rs7412, rs405509 variants, and several environmental factors to the development of hypertension disease in the China Han population. A hospital-based case-control study was conducted. Cases were hypertension (n=211) and controls were normal participants (n=434). The AA, AG, and GG genotype frequencies of GALNT2 rs4846914 were 22.8%, 43.1%, and 34.1% in hypertension subjects, and 35.3%, 44.2%, and 20.5% in controls (P<0.05), respectively. The OR of the AG genotype adjusted for all risk factors compared to the AA genotype was 1.61 (95%CI: 1.02 to 2.56) and to the GG genotype 2.67 (95%CI: 1.59 to 4.488). There was no significant difference between the APOE rs429358, rs7412, and rs405509 genotype frequencies in hypertension and control subjects. The present work indicates that SNP rs4846914 in GALNT2 gene is related to an increased risk of hypertension in China Han population, but the APOE gene is not."

Previous study had identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH) genes associated with UADT cancers in European and Japanese populations. We sought to determine if these SNPs associated with laryngeal, esophageal, gastric or colorectal cancer in Chinese population. We conducted a case-control study among 1577 cases and 1013 healthy controls from northwest China. Five SNPs associated with UADT cancers risk were selected from previous genome-wide association studies and genotyped using Sequenom Mass-ARRAY technology. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression adjusting for age and gender. We identified that the minor alleles of rs1789924 and rs971074 were associated with decreased risk of laryngeal cancer (OR = 0.311; 95% CI = 0.161-0.602; P < 0.001) and esophagus cancer (OR = 0.711; 95% CI = 0.526-0.962; P = 0.027) in allelic model analysis, respectively. In the genetic model analysis, we found the ""C/T"" genotype of rs1789924 was associated with decreased laryngeal cancer risk in codominant model (P = 0.046) and overdominant model (P = 0.013); the ""C/T-T/T"" genotype of rs1789924 was associated with reduced risk of laryngeal cancer under dominant model (P = 0.013).

26389889,26389889,Association of Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) Gene Polymorphisms and of Serum NAMPT Levels with Dilated Cardiomyopathy in a Chinese Population.,"Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) has crucial roles for myocardial development, cardiomyocyte energy metabolism and cell death/survival by regulating NAD⁺-dependent sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) deacetylase. This study aimed to determine if the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the NAMPT gene may affect the susceptibility and prognosis for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and to describe the association of serum NAMPT levels with clinical features of DCM. Three SNPs (rs61330082, rs2505568, and rs9034) were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method in a case-control study of 394 DCM patients and 395 controls from China. Serum NAMPT levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The homozygote for the minor allele at rs2505568 and rs9034 could not be detected in this study. Rs9034 T allele and CT genotype were associated with increased DCM risk (OR: 1.63, 95% CI = 1.16-2.27, p = 0.005 and OR: 1.72, 95% CI = 1.20-2.50, p = 0.0027, respectively). Nominally significant decreased DCM risk was found to be associated with the A allele and AT genotype of rs2505568 (OR: 0.48, 95% CI = 0.35-0.67, p < 0.0001 and OR: 0.44, 95% CI = 0.31-0.62, p < 0.0001, respectively), but it should be interpreted with caution because of Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium in the control group. Of five haplotypes constructed, TAC (rs61330082-rs2505568-rs9034) was a protective haplotype to DCM (OR: 0.22, 95% CI = 0.13-0.39, p = 1.84 × 10(-8)). The Cox multivariate survival analysis indicated that the rs9034 CT genotype (hazard ratio (HR): 0.59, 95% CI = 0.37-0.96, p = 0.03) was an independently multivariate predictor for longer overall survival in DCM patients. Serum NAMPT levels were significantly higher in the DCM group than controls (p < 0.0001) and gradually increased with the increase of New York Heart Association grade in DCM patients. However, there was a lack of association of the three SNPs with serum NAMPT levels. Spearman correlation test revealed that the NAMPT level was positively associated with brain natriuretic peptide (r = 0.56, p = 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (r = 0.293, p = 0.011) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (r = 0.294, p = 0.011). Our study suggested that NAMPT may play an important role in the development of DCM."
26383524,26383524,Identification of a shared protective genetic susceptibility locus for colorectal cancer and gastric cancer.,"Risk of both colorectal cancer (CRC) and gastric cancer (GC) is considered to be heritable with mounting evidence for their genetic susceptibility. However, it remains unknown whether a shared genetic background is underlying these two cancers. A total of ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with digestive system cancers risk were selected from previous genome-wide association studies. All SNPs were genotyped in 449 CRC cases, 588 GC cases, and 703 controls using Sequenom Mass-ARRAY technology. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age and gender, and evaluated their association with both cancers in a Han Chinese population using chi-squared (χ (2)) test and genetic model analysis. By χ (2) test, we found that rs2057314 (p = 0.028; OR = 1.21) was significantly associated with an increased risk of CRC, rs7758229 (p = 0.005; OR = 0.77) was significantly associated with a decreased risk of GC. Furthermore, a shared susceptibility locus rs9502893 was found to have significant protective effect against CRC (p = 0.010; OR = 0.80) and GC (p = 0.0003; OR = 0.74). Our findings could provide insight into the underlying shared a partly overlapping genetic aspect of CRC and GC in a Chinese population. Additional studies are required to verify and discover more common genetic variants associated with risk for digestive system cancers."
26384301,26384301,The association analysis of lncRNA HOTAIR genetic variants and gastric cancer risk in a Chinese population.,"The HOX transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR), a well-known long noncoding RNA, is involved in pathogenesis and progress of multiple tumors. Its ectopic expression and biological functions have been observed in gastric cancer. In this study, we conducted a two-stage case-control study to evaluate whether genetic variations of HOTAIR were associated with gastric cancer risk. We identified that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4759314 was significantly associated with the increased gastric cancer risk with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.39 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13-1.71, P = 0.002] in the combined sets. Further functional experiments revealed the allele-specific effects on HOTAIR and HOXC11 expressions in gastric cancer tissues, of which HOTAIR and HOXC11 expressions of individuals carrying with AG genotype were much higher than those with AA genotype; similarly, the effects occurred in intronic promoter activities, of which the promoter activity of G allele was more pronounced than that of A allele. Interestingly, we identified a novel potential oncogene HOXC11 in gastric cancer pathogenesis with differential expression in gastric cancer tissues by association analysis with candidate gene strategy. These results suggest that SNP rs4759314 of HOTAIR acts as a potential biomarker for predicting gastric cancer, and the role of HOXC11 in gastric cancer etiology is warranted to further investigation."

26379930,26379930,Association between polymorphism of CD20 gene and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in Chinese population.,"Rituximab was widely used in clinical practice. Some chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients were primary or secondary resistance to rituximab, but the mechanism has not been yet clear. CD20 gene coding region was amplified by PCR in 92 cases of newly diagnosed CLL patients and 200 healthy donors. The expression of CD20 was conducted in peripheral blood specimens of CLL patients. Proportions of CD20 expression and fluorescence intensity were detected by flow cytometry. Exon-3 c.246C>T (rs17155019) and Exon-4 c.632C>T (rs2070770) were present in 4.35% (4/92) and 9.78% (9/92) of newly diagnosed CLL patients. The mutations were not found in remaining exons. The frequency of C/C genotype and C allele of rs2070770 were significantly higher than the normal control population (90.22% vs 81.00%, P=0.04; 95.11% vs 90%, P=0.04). There was no significant relationship between genotypes with CLL development (P>0.05), however, C allele of rs2070770 may be associated with CLL (P=0.04, OR=0.46, 95% CI=0.22-0.98). The expression CD20 mRNA, proportion and intensity of CD20 were no significant different between genotypes of two polymorphic loci (P>0.05). Low expression of CD20 for CLL was not associated with mutation of CD20 gene coding region. Other mechanisms, such as promoter methylation, may result in low expression of CD20."
26382569,26382569,Replication of ZNF804A gene variant associations with risk of heroin addiction.,"Heroin addiction is heritable, but few specific genetic variants have been reproducibly associated with this disease. The zinc finger protein 804A (ZNF804A) gene is a biologically plausible susceptibility gene for heroin addiction, given its function as a transcription factor in human brain. Novel associations of two common ZNF804A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs7597593 and rs1344706, with heroin addiction have been reported in Han Chinese. Both SNPs have also been implicated for regulating ZNF804A expression in human brain, including the addiction-relevant dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In this independent replication study, we tested the rs7597593 and rs1344706 SNP genotypes and their corresponding haplotypes for association with heroin addiction using cases drawn from the Urban Health Study and population controls: total N = 10 757 [7095 European Americans (EAs) and 3662 African Americans (AAs)]. We independently replicated both ZNF804A SNP associations in EAs: the rs7597593-T (P = 0.016) and rs1344706-A (P = 0.029) alleles both being associated with increased risk of heroin addiction, consistent with the prior report. Neither SNP was associated in AAs alone, but meta-analysis across both ancestry groups resulted in significant associations for rs1344706-A [P = 0.016, odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 1.13 (1.02-1.25)] and its haplotype with rs7597593-T [P = 0.0067, odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 1.16 (1.04-1.29)]. By showing consistent associations across independent studies and diverse ancestry groups, our study provides evidence that these two ZNF804A SNPs and their risk haplotype are among the few replicable genetic associations with heroin addiction."

Genetic factors as well as environmental factors play a role in development of gastric cancer. To investigate the independent roles of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in base excision repair (BER) genes (APE1 and NEIL2), carcinogen metabolism gene (CYP2E1) and tumor suppressor pathway gene (MDM2) for gastric cancer susceptibility in a Chinese population, we conducted a hospital based case-control study to evaluate the potential association between these polymorphisms and susceptibility to gastric cancer in a Northern Jiangsu population. We also associated the NEIL-2 mRNA expression with the studied NEIL2 SNP genotypes to assess whether the genotypes have influence on the NEIL2 mRNA (hence protein) expression. Five SNPs, APE 1 (rs2275008), NEIL 2 (rs804270), MDM2 (rs2279744), and CYP 2E1 (rs2480256 and rs2031920), were genotyped by TaqMan assays in 105 gastric cancer cases and 118 controls. Genotype frequency distribution showed that the APE 1 SNP (rs2275008), NEIL 2 SNP (rs804270), MDM2 SNP (rs2279744), and CYP 2E1 SNP (rs2031920) had more mutant alleles in gastric cancer cases than controls (76.19, 68.57, 54.29, and 43.81%, respectively), while CYP 2E1 SNP (rs2480256) had large percentage of both alleles (43.81%). Risk analysis revealed that there was increased risk for gastric cancer in subjects with mutant alleles in APE 1 (rs2275008: OR 5.49, 95% CI = 2.6-5.7, p <.0001), NEIL 2 (rs804270: OR 2.3, 95% CI = 1.22-4.3, p=0.01), MDM2 (rs2279744: OR 14.65, 95% CI = 5.63-8.15, p < .0001), and CYP 2E1 (rs2031920: OR 8.385, 95% CI = 3.2-5.3, p < .0001) SNPs. Moreover, the NEIL2 mRNA expression analysis showed that there was significant differential expression of NEIL2 mRNA among the randomly tested NEIL2 genotypes (p = 0.005), with low expression seen in variant genotypes than in other genotypes. In conclusion, variant alleles in the NEIL2 (rs804270), APE1 (rs2275008), CYP2E1 (rs2031920) and MDM2 (rs2279744) SNPs may independently influence susceptibility to gastric cancer in a Northern Jiangsu Chinese population. The genotypes may also independently influence their respective gene mRNA expression, as seen in our study, where there was differential expression of the NEIL2 mRNA among the genotypes, with low NEIL2 mRNA expression seen in the variant genotype."
26365437,26365437,Donor miR-196a-2 polymorphism is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after liver transplantation in a Han Chinese population.,"Recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of death after liver transplantation (LT). We aim to evaluate the association of donor and recipient single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the risk of HCC recurrence after LT. A total of 155 adult patients who underwent primary LT for HCC were enrolled. Ten SNPs associated with HCC susceptibility were genotyped. Patients who received donor livers with the rs11614913 homozygous CC variant presented significantly higher recurrence rates of HCC (41.7 vs. 15.3%, p = 0.009) and lower cumulative tumor-free survival (p = 0.005) than those who received TT wild-type donor livers. The donor rs11614913 genetic variant was an independent risk factor for HCC recurrence (odds ratio = 2 per each C allele, p < 0.05) and could significantly improve the predictive abilities of clinical models (Milan, UCSF and Hangzhou criteria). Donor livers homozygous for rs11614913 CC were associated with a higher miR-196a expression than TT (p = 0.002). In a lentiviral infection of mouse liver and orthotopic mouse model of HCC, the liver miR-196a overexpression group showed a significantly larger tumor size than the control group (p = 0.001). There is a close association between the tumor size and expression of miR-196a in the liver (r = 0.693, p = 0.001). In conclusion, the donor miR-196a-2 rs11614913 polymorphism is associated with HCC recurrence after LT and improves the predictive value of clinical models. The overexpression of miR-196a in the liver might provide a tumor-favorable environment for the development of HCC."
26365205,26365205,Association between CD14 gene promoter polymorphisms with serum total-IgE and eosinophil levels in atopic and non-atopic asthma patients in a Chinese Han population.,The aim of this study was to investigate the association between CD14 gene promoter SNPs with serum total-IgE and eosinophil levels in atopic asthma and non-atopic asthma in Chinese Han.
26354101,26354101,A genetic variant in CAMKK2 gene is possibly associated with increased risk of bipolar disorder.,"A recent large-scale study have reported that rs1063843, a single nucleotide polymorphism located in the CAMKK2 gene is highly associated with schizophrenia in European and Han Chinese populations. Increasing evidences show that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have some common genetic variance. Here, we evaluated the association of this variant with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in Iranian population. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of 500 schizophrenic patients, 500 bipolar patients and 500 normal controls and all were genotyped for the rs1063843 using a PCR-RFLP method. The allele frequency of rs1063843 was significantly different in both schizophrenia and bipolar patients comparing to control group. For the first time, we showed that rs1063843 is highly associated with bipolar disorder, although more replication studies are needed to confirm our findings. Our results also support the findings of previous studies suggesting a significant association between rs1063843 and schizophrenia."
26375522,26375522,Association between polymorphisms of interleukin 12 and rheumatoid arthritis associated biomarkers in a Chinese population.,The aim of the present study was to examine the association between polymorphisms of interleukin 12 (IL-12) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) associated biomarkers in a Chinese population.
26364108,26364108,Joint genome-wide association study for milk fatty acid traits in Chinese and Danish Holstein populations.,"The identification of causal genes or genomic regions associated with fatty acids (FA) will enhance our understanding of the pathways underlying FA synthesis and provide opportunities for changing milk fat composition through a genetic approach. The linkage disequilibrium between adjacent markers is highly consistent between the Chinese and Danish Holstein populations, such that a joint genome-wide association study (GWAS) can be performed. In this study, a joint GWAS was performed for 16 milk FA traits based on data of 784 Chinese and 371 Danish Holstein cows genotyped by a high-density bovine single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. A total of 486,464 SNP markers on 29 bovine autosomes were used. Bonferroni corrections were applied to adjust the significance thresholds for multiple testing at the genome- and chromosome-wide levels. According to the analysis of either the Chinese or Danish data individually, the total numbers of overlapping SNP that were significant at the chromosome level were 94 for C14:1, 208 for the C14 index, and 1 for C18:0. Joint analysis using the combined data of the 2 populations detected greater numbers of significant SNP compared with either of the individual populations alone for 7 and 10 traits at the genome- and chromosome-wide significance levels, respectively. Greater numbers of significant SNP were detected for C18:0 and the C18 index in the Chinese population compared with the joint analysis. Sixty-five significant SNP across all traits had significantly different effects in the 2 populations. Ten FA were influenced by a quantitative trait loci (QTL) region including DGAT1. Both C14:1 and the C14 index were influenced by a QTL region including SCD1 in the combined population. Other QTL regions also showed significant associations with the studied FA. A large region (14.9-24.9 Mbp) in BTA26 significantly influenced C14:1 and the C14 index in both populations, mostly likely due to the SNP in SCD1. A QTL region (69.97-73.69 Mbp) on BTA9 showed a significantly different effect on C18:0 between the 2 populations. Detection of these important SNP and the corresponding QTL regions will be helpful for follow-up studies to identify causal mutations and their interaction with environments for milk FA in dairy cattle."
26350268,26350268,Association study of ankylosing spondylitis and polymorphisms in ERAP1 gene in Zhejiang Han Chinese population.,"The susceptibility loci of ERAP1 polymorphisms have been found to be strongly associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The researches in multiple ethnic cohorts suggested that the population attributable risk in ERAP1 polymorphisms is at a high significance level. This study was undertaken to estimate the prevalence and incidence of subsets of AS and investigate the specific variants of ERAP1 polymorphisms in AS susceptibility, in the Han ethnic Chinese population in Zhejiang Province. AS patients were selected, diagnosed, and confirmed by a qualified rheumatologist. The basal clinical and demographic characteristics were compared with all subjects. Genotypes for eight selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ERAP1 gene (rs27038, rs27037, rs27434, rs27980, rs7711564, rs30187, rs10050860, and rs17482078) were determined by using the Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX platform in Zhejiang Han Chinese population. Association analyses were performed on the whole genotyped data set in 707 unrelated ankylosing spondylitis cases and 837 ethnically matched controls. We observed the strongest association between AS and HLA-B27, which confers over 90 % of ankylosing spondylitis cases. Moreover, we found three loci of ERAP1 polymorphisms were at a high significance level (rs27037 P = 0.00451; rs27434 P = 0.00012; rs27980 P = 0.00682) with AS in Zhejiang population. We also confirmed polymorphism locus of ERAP1 previously reported association with AS (rs27434; P = 5.3 × 10(-12)). Our results indicated a difference in the mechanism of susceptibility loci in subsets of Zhejiang Han Chinese population and provided further evidence that rs27434 is the key polymorphism associated with AS in ERAP1 gene."
26349055,26349055,Genetic polymorphisms of RAGE and risk of ulcerative colitis in a Chinese population.,"The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and its proinflammatory ligands are critically implicated in the pathological progression of ulcerative colitis (UC). Functional polymorphisms in the regulatory elements and/or ligand-binding regions of the RAGE gene affect the expression and function of RAGE and thus may increase susceptibility to UC. In this study, a total of 266 unrelated UC patients and 247 control subjects were analyzed for 3 RAGE single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (-429 T/C, -374 T/A, and G82S) using an improved small-amplicon high resolution melting curve (HRM) analysis assay. Serum levels of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) were determined by a double sandwich ELISA system. The genotypes, alleles and haplotypes were analyzed and compared between UC patients and control subjects. Three pairs of genotyping primers for three RAGE polymorphism loci (-429 T/C, -374 T/A, and G82S) were developed based on HRM. Significant differences in the allele distribution of the G82S polymorphism was found among UC cases and controls from a Chinese population. Carriers of the RAGE G82S variant genotype were at higher risk of UC (OR=2.594, 95% CI: 1.778-3.784, P<0.001) than homozygous wild-type individuals. Further analyses revealed that the 82 (GS+SS) variant genotype was associated with patients who have extended UC (OR=1.924, 95% CI: 1.163-3.181, P=0.010), and a family history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (OR=1.923, 95% CI: 1.049-3.521, P=0.032). The polymorphisms -374 T/A and -429 T/C did not demonstrate any association with UC, but an association was found between the -374(TA+AA) variant genotypes and the serum sRAGE level (P=0.002). Moreover, haplotypes T/A/A and T/A/G showed significantly different frequencies between UC patients and controls (OR=3.337, 95% CI: 1.892-6.091, P=0.026; OR=0.530, 95% CI: 0.351-0.801, P=0.002). The present study developed novel primers based on HRM to provide preliminary evidence in a Chinese population that the RAGE polymorphism is involved in genetic susceptibility to UC and that the 82(GS+SS) genotype of G82S is a risk factor for UC. Furthermore, RAGE polymorphisms may be related to the location of UC as well as a family history of IBD in a Chinese population."
26347319,26347319,Case-control association study of ABCB1 gene and major depressive disorder in a local Chinese Han population.,Human P-glycoprotein encoded by the ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1) gene is expressed in the blood-brain barrier. ABCB1 protects the brain from many drugs and toxins such as glucocorticoids through the efflux pump. Recent evidence suggests that a specific allele of the ABCB1 gene confers susceptibility to major depressive disorder (MDD) in the Japanese population. The aim of this study was to explore the association of ABCB1 gene polymorphisms with MDD in a local Chinese Han population.
26347468,26347468,Association Between the Gene Polymorphisms of HDAC9 and the Risk of Atherosclerosis and Ischemic Stroke.,"Genome-wide association studies have demonstrated various polymorphisms of histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) gene was strong risk locus for large-vessel stroke, but the results were controversial. This study aims to replicate the association between the previous detected SNPs of HDAC9 and the susceptibility of ischemic stroke. The study population consisted of 262 consecutive patients diagnosed with ischemic stroke and 300 age and gender matched unrelated controls between October 2012 and October 2014. Rs11984041, rs2389995, and rs2240419 of HDAC9 were genotyped and compared between the cases and controls. The SNP rs11984041 of HDAC9 was found nonpolymorphic in the population involved. The G allele of rs2389995 was found significantly associated with decreased risk of ischemic stroke, no matter with the codominant (AG v.s AA, 0.53 (0.36-0.77), P < 0.001; GG v.s AA, 0.63 (0.27-1.43), P < 0.001), dominant (AG + GG v.s AA, 0.54 (0.38-0.78), P < 0.001), or the recessive model (GG vs AA + AG, 0.75 (0.33-1.71), P < 0.001). On the other hand, The T allele of rs2240419 was found significantly associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke, no matter with the codominant (CT v.s CC, 1.75 (1.22-2.51), P < 0.001; TT v.s CC, 2.67 (1.55-4.61), P < 0.001), dominant (CT + TT v.s CC, 1.93 (1.38-2.71), P < 0.001), or the recessive model (TT vs CC + CT, 2.07 (1.23-3.47), P < 0.001). No linkage disequilibrium was found between rs2389995 and rs2240419 of HDAC9. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the SNP rs11984041 of HDAC9 was nonpolymorphic in Chinese Han population. The minor G allele of rs2389995 significantly decreased and the minor T allele of rs2240419 significantly increased the risk of ischemic stroke."

26346037,26346037,-141C insertion/deletion polymorphism of the dopamine D2 receptor gene is associated with schizophrenia in Chinese Han population: Evidence from an ethnic group-specific meta-analysis.,"Accumulate evidence has implicated dopamine D2 receptor gene polymorphisms in the etiology of schizophrenia. A single nucleotide polymorphism, -141C insertion/deletion (Ins/Del) (rs1799732), in the promoter region of the dopamine D2 receptor gene has been linked to schizophrenia; however, the data are inconclusive. This study investigated whether the -141C polymorphism is associated with the risk of schizophrenia in different ethnic groups by performing a meta-analysis. A total of 24 case-control studies examining the association between -141C Ins/Del polymorphism and schizophrenia were identified according to established inclusion criteria. Significant association was revealed between -141C Ins/Del polymorphism and schizophrenia risk in dominant genetic model (Ins/Ins + Ins/Del versus Del/Del) (odds ratio = 0.33, 95% confidence interval = 0.14-0.81, z = 2.41, P = 0.02) in Chinese Han but not in Caucasian, Japanese or India populations. Our results indicate that -141C Ins/Del polymorphism might be a susceptibility factor for schizophrenia in Chinese Han population."
26345810,26345810,Correlation between natriuretic peptide receptor C (NPR3) gene polymorphisms and hypertension in the Dai people of China.,"Hypertension affects one-fifth of the world population. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that correlated with hyper-tension in large samples. However, the genetic mutations leading to hypertension might differ among various populations, as they have different origins and are subjected to different environmental pressures. Therefore, additional studies are urgently needed to verify the GWAS findings across different populations. This study focused on the natriuretic peptide receptor C gene (NPR3), one of the hypertension-positive genes identified in a GWAS of an East Asian population. The correlation analysis between NPR3 and hypertension was replicated in 450 Chinese Dai (235 patients vs 215 controls) and 484 Chinese Mongolian (211 patients vs 273 controls) individuals. The positive SNP identified by GWAS analysis and three other tag SNPs representing the NPR3 linkage disequilibrium (LD) block regions were selected for genotyping. The results revealed that the rs1173766 polymorphism was associated with the occurrence of hypertension (χ(2) = 6.87, P = 0.0088), and that the T allele should be protective in the Dai ethnic group. Consider-ing a close LD block at the 3' end of the NPR3 gene in the East Asian population, we speculate that there might be a mutation in the last five exons or the 3' untranslated region of NPR3 that could change the structure or expression of the NPR3 gene. However, in the Mongolian ethnic group, these SNPs were not associated with the incidence of hypertension, suggesting population heterogeneity for the genetic factors that contribute to hypertension."
26345801,26345801,Association of TLR2 and TLR4 non-missense single nucleotide polymorphisms with type 2 diabetes risk in a southern Chinese population: a case-control study.,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs), the triggers of the innate and adaptive immune responses, are involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several studies have investigated the effects of genetic polymorphisms in TLR4 and TLR2, but they have yielded limited results. We investigated whether non-missense genetic polymorphisms in the regulatory regions of TLR4 and TLR2 were related to T2DM in a southern Chinese population. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR4 (rs1927911, rs11536889, rs1927907, rs1927906, rs1927914, rs7873784, and rs2149356) and TLR2 (rs1898830, rs3804099, rs4696480, and rs3804100) were genotyped in 552 T2DM and 552 unrelated age- and gender-matched controls by SNaPShot Multiplex assay. Genotypes GG (OR = 0.09, 95%CI = 0.01- 0.83, P = 0.03) and CG (OR = 0.08, 95%CI = 0.01-0.74, P = 0.03) of the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) SNP rs7873784 in TLR4, and genotype AG (OR = 0.67, 95%CI = 0.46-0.97, P = 0.04) and allele G (OR = 0.88, 95%CI = 0.79-0.97, P = 0.01) of the intron SNP rs1898830 in TLR2 were identified as protective against the development of T2DM in southern Chinese people. In contrast, a meta-analysis of rs1927911 and rs1927914 showed no association. Haplotypes AGTT (OR = 0.34, 95%CI = 0.15-0.77, P = 0.01) and AATT (OR = 1.20, 95%CI = 1.01- 1.44, P = 0.05) in TLR2 were significantly associated with susceptibility to T2DM. Our results suggest that the effects of non-missense polymorphisms located in the regulatory regions of TLR4 and TLR2 should not be neglected in T2DM association analysis."
26352671,26352671,Whole-Genome Analysis of Diversity and SNP-Major Gene Association in Peach Germplasm.,"Peach was domesticated in China more than four millennia ago and from there it spread world-wide. Since the middle of the last century, peach breeding programs have been very dynamic generating hundreds of new commercial varieties, however, in most cases such varieties derive from a limited collection of parental lines (founders). This is one reason for the observed low levels of variability of the commercial gene pool, implying that knowledge of the extent and distribution of genetic variability in peach is critical to allow the choice of adequate parents to confer enhanced productivity, adaptation and quality to improved varieties. With this aim we genotyped 1,580 peach accessions (including a few closely related Prunus species) maintained and phenotyped in five germplasm collections (four European and one Chinese) with the International Peach SNP Consortium 9K SNP peach array. The study of population structure revealed the subdivision of the panel in three main populations, one mainly made up of Occidental varieties from breeding programs (POP1OCB), one of Occidental landraces (POP2OCT) and the third of Oriental accessions (POP3OR). Analysis of linkage disequilibrium (LD) identified differential patterns of genome-wide LD blocks in each of the populations. Phenotypic data for seven monogenic traits were integrated in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The significantly associated SNPs were always in the regions predicted by linkage analysis, forming haplotypes of markers. These diagnostic haplotypes could be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in modern breeding programs."
26345874,26345874,Association of the VRK2 gene rs3732136 polymorphism with schizophrenia in a Northwest Chinese Han population.,"Previous studies have found that the vaccinia related kinase 2 gene (VRK2) polymorphism was associated with schizophrenia (SCZ) in the worldwide population. This association was further supported by VRK2 mRNA expression patterns and brain structure variations. Here, we analyzed four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the VRK2 gene in a total population of 893 samples, consisting of 360 patients with SCZ and 533 healthy controls of Han Chinese descent using the SNPscan method. Single SNP, haplotype, and gender-specific association analyses were performed. We found that rs3732136 was significantly associated with SCZ (P = 0.042; odds ratio = 1.25; 95% confidence interval = 1.01-1.55). Further genotype and haplotype association analyses suggested a similar pattern. Our data provide preliminary evidence that the VRK2 gene might play a major role in the development of SCZ in the Northwest Chinese Han population."

26337060,26337060,Lack of Association Between Polymorphisms in Dopa Decarboxylase and Dopamine Receptor-1 Genes With Childhood Autism in Chinese Han Population.,"Genetic factors play an important role in childhood autism. This study is to determine the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in dopa decarboxylase (DDC) and dopamine receptor-1 (DRD1) genes with childhood autism, in a Chinese Han population. A total of 211 autistic children and 250 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were recruited. The severity of disease was determined by Children Autism Rating Scale scores. TaqMan Probe by real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine genotypes and allele frequencies of single-nucleotide polymorphism rs6592961 in DDC and rs251937 in DRD1. Case-control and case-only studies were respectively performed, to determine the contribution of both single-nucleotide polymorphisms to the predisposition of disease and its severity. Our results showed that there was no significant association of the genotypes and allele frequencies of both single-nucleotide polymorphisms concerning childhood autism and its severity. More studies with larger samples are needed to corroborate their predicting roles."

26314850,26314850,Association of CELF2 polymorphism and the prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in southern Chinese population.,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy with high metastatic potential and loco-regional recurrence. The overall survival of NPC has been limited from further improvement partly due to the lack of effective biomarker for accurate prognosis prediction and precise treatments. Here, in light of the implication of CELF gene family in cancer prognosis, we selected 112 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in six members of the family and tested their associations with the clinical outcomes in a discovery cohort of 717 NPC patients. Survival analyses under multivariate cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier curve revealed five promising SNPs, which were further validated in another independent sample of 1,520 cases. Combined analysis revealed that SNP rs3740194 in CELF2 was significantly associated with the decreased risk of death with a Hazard ratio (HR) of 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.58-0.82, codominant model). Moreover, rs3740194 also showed a significant association with superior metastasis-free survival (HR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.57-0.83, codominant model). Taken together, our findings suggested that genetic variant of rs3740194 in CELF2 gene might be a valuable predictor for NPC prognosis, and potentially useful in the personalized treatment of NPC."

Tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system PCR (T-ARMS-PCR) is a new method offering fast detection and extreme simplicity at a negligible cost for SNP genotyping. In this paper, we investigated the genetic variations at different ages of 660 Chinese indigenous cattle belonging to three breeds (QC, NY, JX) and applied T-ARMS-PCR and PCR-RFLP methods to genotype four SNPs, SNP1: g.A2980G, SNP2: g.A2996T, SNP3: g.A36718G, SNP4: g.G36850A. The statistical analyses indicated that these 4 SNPs affected growth traits markedly (P<0.05) in QC population, whereas combined haplotypes were not (P>0.05). The qPCR (quantitative PCR) indicated that bovine PNPLA3 gene was exclusively expressed in fat tissues. Besides, the analysis between SNP and mRNA expression revealed that, in SNP1, the expression of AG was much higher than AA and GG (P<0.05), which was in accordance with the results of growth traits association analysis, while the results of SNP4 was not. These results supported high potential that SNPs of bovine PNPLA3 gene might be utilized as genetic markers in marker-assisted selection (MAS) for Chinese cattle breeding programs."
26313529,26313529,Single nucleotide polymorphisms near the inhibin beta B gene on 2q14 are associated with pre-eclampsia in Han Chinese women.,"Pre-eclampsia (PE) is the most common medical complication of pregnancy encountered worldwide. A previous genome-wide association study showed that three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located near the inhibin beta B gene (INHBB) - rs12711941 (T>G), rs7576192 (A>G) and rs7579169 (T>C) - were associated with PE in Australian women. The present study was undertaken to assess the genetic association between these three SNPs and the risk of PE in Han Chinese women."
26304507,26304507,Association of gastrointestinal gland cancer susceptibility loci with esophageal carcinoma among the Chinese Han population: a case-control study.,"Esophageal carcinoma (EC) is a common malignancy worldwide. Previous studies indicated that gastrointestinal gland cancer and EC share some susceptibility loci. Our aim was to identify new single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with EC by investigating whether known gastrointestinal cancers susceptibility loci are found in EC patients. A Chinese Han population case-control study was conducted to assess SNP associations with EC risk. Twenty-six SNPs were selected from gastrointestinal cancer susceptibility loci, and 360 EC patients and 310 controls were genotyped for these SNPs using Sequenom MassARRAY technology. The association of SNP frequencies with EC was analyzed by chi-square tests, and genetic model analysis. After Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) p value screening, we excluded two SNPs. Based on chi-square tests, the minor alleles of rs13294589 (p = 0.046) and rs4924935 (p = 0.046) were correlated with reduced EC risk and rs4269383 (p = 0.010) and rs10953615 (p = 0.036) were correlated with increased EC risk. In the genetic model analyses, we found that the minor alleles ""T"" of rs401681, ""A"" of rs10088262, and ""C"" of rs4924935 may reduce the risk of EC. rs401681 has previously been reported to be associated with EC. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report an association of the other five SNPs with EC. Our findings provide evidence for the genetic variants associated with susceptibility to EC in the Chinese Han population, which might be used as potential molecular markers for detecting susceptibility to EC in Chinese Han people."
26313240,26313240,Association of the functional SNP rs2275294 in ZNF512B with risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease in Han Chinese.,"The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2275294 of the ZNF512B gene has been reported to be associated with a risk of ALS in the Japanese population. Here we conducted a case-control study examining the possible association of rs2275294 with risk of sporadic ALS and PD in Han Chinese. Our study included 301 patients with ALS and 457 age- and gender-matched controls, as well as 555 patients with PD and 473 age- and gender-matched controls. Subjects were genotyped at rs2275293 using the ligase detection reaction. The genotype distribution of rs2275294 shows significant difference between patients with ALS and the control group according to the dominant model (OR 1.518, 95% CI 1.074-2.145, p = 0.018) and based on alleles (OR 1.249, 95% 1.016-1.534, p = 0.035). Stratification analysis showed a significant difference between females with ALS and female controls based on the dominant model (OR 3.285, 95% CI 1.856-5.815, p < 0.001) or alleles (OR 1.697, 95% CI 1.208-2.383, p = 0.002). In contrast, no significant differences were identified between rs2275294 and patients with PD. In conclusion, our case-control study suggests that the CC genotype and C allele at rs2275294 are associated with increased risk of ALS in Han Chinese, particularly females."
26307051,26307051,Heterogeneity revealed through meta-analysis might link geographical differences with nasopharyngeal carcinoma incidence in Han Chinese populations.,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an epithelial malignancy highly prevalent in southern China, and incidence rates among Han Chinese people vary according to geographic region. Recently, three independent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) confirmed that HLA-A is the main risk gene for NPC. However, the results of studies conducted in regions with dissimilar incidence rates contradicted the claims that HLA-A is the sole risk gene and that the association of rs29232 is independent of the HLA-A effect in the chromosome 6p21.3 region."
26297999,26297999,Genetic variations of NKX2-5 in sporadic atrial septal defect and ventricular septal defect in Chinese Yunnan population.,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth abnormality, and more than 40% CHD subtypes are sporadic atrial septal defect (ASD) and ventricular septal defect (VSD). The etiology of ASD and VSD remains largely unknown. NKX2-5 gene is a highly conserved homeobox protein gene and expressed in the developing heart. Its mutations can cause sporadic ASD and VSD. This study aimed to investigate the genetic variations of NKX2-5 in ASD and VSD in Chinese Yunnan population. The whole 2 coding exon and partial flanking intron sequences of NKX2-5 gene were screened using DNA sequencing in 107 ASD patients and 391 VSD patients as well as 487 healthy individuals (control) who had parental origin (three generations) from the Yunnan province in China. Results found that, 4 reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs2277923, rs3729753, rs703752 and rs202071628) were detected. A novel heterozygous DNA sequence variant (DSV) (1500G>C) in the 3'UTR region of NKX2-5 gene were identified in 2 VSD patients, but none in ASD and controls. One single nucleotide polymorphism (rs2277923), the frequency of which was significantly higher in ASD group, and the allele and genotype were associated with the occurrence of ASD. Besides, a weak statistical association existed between rs703752 and VSD (uncorrected P=0.028). The novel DSV (1500G>C) of NKX2-5 gene may contribute to a small number of VSD, and rs2277923 SNP may contribute to the risk of sporadic ASD in Chinese Yunnan population."

26309605,26309605,Association between genetic variants of DVWA and osteoarthritis of the knee and hip: a comprehensive meta-analysis.,"Recently, double von Willebrand factor domain A (DVWA) gene, a previously unknown gene, was revealed to contain several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that showed consistent association with knee osteoarthritis (OA) in Japanese and Chinese cohorts. However, subsequent studies failed to confirm this result in several different populations. To deal with the issues raised by inconsistent results among those studies, we investigated the association between DVWA and OA using meta-analytic techniques, combining all published data up to December 2014. 10 independent samples from 4 teams contributed data for a possible association between SNP rs7639618 and knee or hip OA. The total number of cases and controls of this SNP was respectively 4,142 versus 6,575 for knee OA, and 2,325 versus 2,914 for hip OA. A trend of significant association was observed in the combined population with knee OA (P=0.06), and a significant difference was identified between patients with knee OA and controls for the G-allele of rs7639618 (P=0.02). Together with the reported functional studies, our results indicate that DVWA may have a small but strong effect on the susceptibility to knee OA, at least in Asian population. Further functional studies are needed to determine the underlying variation of DVWA and to relate this to the pathophysiology of OA."
26289938,26289938,Association of CD40 polymorphisms and haplotype with risk of systemic lupus erythematosus.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease that is caused by genetic and environmental factors. Current evidence shows that the CD40-CD40L system plays a crucial role in the development, progression and outcome of SLE. CD40, which stimulates lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation, is an important immunomodulator and is expressed in the thyroid follicular cells as well as antigen-presenting cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether CD40 gene polymorphism confers susceptibility to SLE and its impact on CD40 expression in Chinese. We analyzed four single nucleotide polymorphisms of CD40 gene rs1883832C/T, rs13040307C/T, rs752118C/T, and rs3765459G/A in 205 patients with SLE and 220 age- and sex-matched controls, using Snapshot SNP genotyping assays and DNA sequencing method. Soluble CD40 (sCD40) levels were measured by ELISA. There were significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of CD40 gene rs1883832 C/T polymorphism between the group of patients with SLE and the control group (P < 0.05). sCD40 levels were increased in patients with SLE compared with controls (P < 0.01). Moreover, genotypes carrying the CD40 rs1883832 T variant allele were associated with increased CD40 levels compared with the homozygous wild-type genotype in patients with SLE. The rs1883832 C/T polymorphism of CD40 and its sCD40 levels were associated with SLE in the Chinese population. These data suggest that CD40 gene may play an essential role in the development of SLE."
26289323,26289323,"Association of p53 rs1042522, MDM2 rs2279744, and p21 rs1801270 polymorphisms with retinoblastoma risk and invasion in a Chinese population.","Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of p53 rs1042522, MDM2 rs2279744 and p21 rs1801270, all in the p53 pathway, which plays a crucial role in DNA damage and genomic instability, were reported to be associated with cancer risk and pathologic characteristics. This case-control study was designed to analyse the association between these SNPs and retinoblastoma (RB) in a Chinese Han population. These SNPs in 168 RB patients and 185 adult controls were genotyped using genomic DNA from venous blood. No significant difference was observed in allele or genotypic frequencies of these SNPs between Chinese RB patients and controls (all P > 0.05). However, the rs1042522 GC genotype showed a protective effect against RB invasion, as demonstrated by event-free survival (HR = 0.53, P = 0.007 for GC versus GG/CC). This effect was significant for patients with a lag time >1 month and no pre-enucleation treatment (P = 0.007 and P = 0.010, respectively), indicating an interaction between p53 rs1042522 and clinical characteristics, including lag time and pre-enucleation treatment status. Thus, the rs1042522 SNP may be associated with RB invasion in the Han Chinese population; however, further large and functional studies are needed to assess the validity of this association."
26283177,26283177,Association Between the 4p16 Susceptibility Locus and the Risk of Atrial Septal Defect in Population from Southeast China.,"Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs16835979, rs870142 and rs6824295, located in chromosome 4p16 were associated with the risk of ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) in the European population. The 4p16 susceptibility locus in congenital heart disease was replicated in Chinese populations. Here, we analyzed the associations between these three SNPs and ASD in Chinese population from Fujian Province in southeast China. We conducted a case-control study by genotyping three SNPs in 354 non-syndromic ASD patients and 557 non-CHD control subjects. Logistic regression analyses showed that the genotype and allele frequencies of these three SNPs were significantly different between the cases and controls in Fujian Chinese population. The allele A of rs870142, the allele A of rs16835979 and the allele A of rs6824295 were significantly associated with an increased risk of ASD. According to the analysis of the three SNPs, the haplotype of AAA was associated with a significantly increased risk of ASD. Our study further supports that these three SNPs confer the predisposition to ASD phenotype in Chinese population."
26302166,26302166,Lack of association of rs3798220 with small apolipoprotein(a) isoforms and high lipoprotein(a) levels in East and Southeast Asians.,"The variant allele of rs3798220 in the apolipoprotein(a) gene (LPA) is used to assess the risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) in Europeans, where it is associated with short alleles of the Kringle IV-2 (KIV-2) copy number variation (CNV) and high lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) concentrations. No association of rs3798220 with CAD was detected in a GWAS of East Asians. Our study investigated the association of rs3798220 with Lp(a) concentrations and KIV-2 CNV size in non-European populations to explain the missing association of the variant with CAD in Asians."

A large meta-analysis including 28,141 individuals identified nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with altered SUA level in a Caucasian population. However, raised SUA level alone is not sufficient for the development of gout arthritis and most of these SNPs have not been studied in a Han Chinese population. Here, we performed a case-control association analysis to investigate the relationship between these SUA correlated SNPs and gout arthritis in Han Chinese."
26284813,26284813,Genome-wide association of polycystic ovary syndrome implicates alterations in gonadotropin secretion in European ancestry populations.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common, highly heritable complex disorder of unknown aetiology characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation and defects in glucose homeostasis. Increased luteinizing hormone relative to follicle-stimulating hormone secretion, insulin resistance and developmental exposure to androgens are hypothesized to play a causal role in PCOS. Here we map common genetic susceptibility loci in European ancestry women for the National Institutes of Health PCOS phenotype, which confers the highest risk for metabolic morbidities, as well as reproductive hormone levels. Three loci reach genome-wide significance in the case-control meta-analysis, two novel loci mapping to chr 8p23.1 [Corrected] and chr 11p14.1, and a chr 9q22.32 locus previously found in Chinese PCOS. The same chr 11p14.1 SNP, rs11031006, in the region of the follicle-stimulating hormone B polypeptide (FSHB) gene strongly associates with PCOS diagnosis and luteinizing hormone levels. These findings implicate neuroendocrine changes in disease pathogenesis."
26278011,26278011,Variants in the Regulatory Region of WNT5A Reduced Risk of Cardiac Conotruncal Malformations in the Chinese Population.,"WNT5A is one of the most highly investigated non-canonical Wnt ligands and is involved in the embryonic heart development, especially in formation of the cardiac conotruncal region by regulating the migration and differentiation of cardiac neural crest (CNC) and second heart field (SHF) cells. No study to date has comprehensively characterized the WNT5A regulatory variants in patients with congenital heart malformations (CHMs). The association between regulatory variants of the WNT5A gene and CHMs was examined in case-control association study in 1,210 CHMs and 798 controls. Individuals carrying a homozygous genotype CC (rs524153) or GG (rs504849) had a similarly reduced risk of conotruncal malformations. The homozygous genotypes (CC for rs524153 and GG for rs504849) were associated with a lower WNT5A transcriptional level compared with the transcriptional level of those with wild-type genotypes. Further functional analysis revealed that an additional upstream single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs371954924 (-5244GCCA > CC) in a linkage disequilibrium (LD) block with the above genotyped SNPs decreased WNT5A expression through the attenuated binding affinity with the transcription factor SOX9. This is the first demonstration that genetic variants in the regulatory regions of WNT5A play a vital role in sporadic conotruncal malformations susceptibility through the changeable expression of the WNT5A gene."
26314684,26314684,Genome-wide Association Study of Autism Spectrum Disorder in the East Asian Populations.,"Autism spectrum disorder is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with strong genetic basis. To identify common genetic variations conferring the risk of ASD, we performed a two-stage genome-wide association study using ASD family and healthy control samples obtained from East Asian populations. A total of 166 ASD families (n = 500) and 642 healthy controls from the Japanese population were used as the discovery cohort. Approximately 900,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP array 6.0 chips. In the replication stage, 205 Japanese ASD cases and 184 healthy controls, as well as 418 Chinese Han trios (n = 1,254), were genotyped by TaqMan platform. Case-control analysis, family based association test, and transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) were then conducted to test the association. In the discovery stage, significant associations were suggested for 14 loci, including 5 known ASD candidate genes: GPC6, JARID2, YTHDC2, CNTN4, and CSMD1. In addition, significant associations were identified for several novel genes with intriguing functions, such as JPH3, PTPRD, CUX1, and RIT2. After a meta-analysis combining the Japanese replication samples, the strongest signal was found at rs16976358 (P = 6.04 × 10(-7)), which is located near the RIT2 gene. In summary, our results provide independent support to known ASD candidate genes and highlight a number of novel genes warranted to be further investigated in a larger sample set in an effort to improve our understanding of the genetic basis of ASD."
26276359,26276359,Association of GRM4 gene polymorphisms with susceptibility and clinicopathological characteristics of osteosarcoma in Guangxi Chinese population.,"Osteosarcoma is the most frequent malignant primary bone tumor. GRM4 is expressed in human osteosarcoma cells, and high expression of mGluR4 in osteosarcoma tissues is related to poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between polymorphism of the GRM4 gene and the susceptibility to osteosarcoma in a Chinese population. In a case-control study, we investigated polymorphisms in the GRM4 gene (rs2229901, rs733457, and rs1906953) with a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (TaqMan). The study was conducted with 126 Chinese patients with osteosarcoma and 168 Chinese subjects in a control group. Unconditional logistic regression was used to analyze the correlation between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and osteosarcoma risk. Different survival rates of different genotypic patients with osteosarcoma were analyzed through Kaplan-Meier. There were statistically significant differences in the distributions of the rs1906953 genotypes between the cases and control group (P = 0.034). However, there was no remarkable difference in the three genotypes of GRM4 gene rs2229901 locus between the patient group and control group (P = 0.369). Survival analysis for rs1906953 showed that the median survival time of osteosarcoma patients with the CC genotype was significantly shorter compared to the CT and TT genotypes; patients carrying CC genotype have apparently got a decrease in their recurrence-free survival time in comparison with patients carrying TT genotype. Our data suggest that GRM4 gene polymorphism is closely related to the morbidity and metastasis of osteosarcoma in a Chinese population."

26277822,26277822,Association of interleukin 3 (IL-3) polymorphisms with schizophrenia in Han Chinese population.,"Schizophrenia has been observed to be associated with various abnormalities in multiple cytokines. Recent genetic analyses showed that the interleukin 3 (IL-3) gene and its receptors are significantly associated with schizophrenia, especially in Irish populations. To examine the associations of the Irish-risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, e.g., rs3916441) in the IL-3 gene with schizophrenia in Chinese population, we utilized two independent samples from Southwestern China, including a total 901 schizophrenia patients and 1417 healthy controls. However, no statistically significant differences were observed in allelic or genotypic frequencies of the tested 6 SNPs in IL-3 between cases and controls in any sample. Therefore, the results of our analyses were not able to confirm the association of IL-3 SNPs with schizophrenia. The absence of the IL-3's association in Chinese population suggest a potential genetic heterogeneity in the susceptibility of schizophrenia on this locus and also demonstrate the difficulties in replicating associations of schizophrenia across different ethnic populations."
26261632,26261632,Association of two polymorphisms in the FADS1/FADS2 gene cluster and the risk of coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke.,"Little is known about the association of the FADS1/FADS2 SNPs and serum lipid levels and the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic stroke (IS) in the Chinese southern population. The present study aimed to determine such association in the Chinese southern population. A total of 1,669 unrelated subjects (CAD, 534; IS, 553; and healthy controls, 582) were recruited in the study. Genotypes of the FADS1 rs174546 SNP and the FADS2 rs174601 SNP were determined by the SNaPshot Multiplex Kit. The T allele and TT genotype frequencies of the two SNPs were predominant in our study population. The T alleles were associated with increased risk of CAD and IS. Correspondingly, the C alleles were associated with reduced risk of CAD and IS. Haplotype analyses showed that the haplotype of T-T (rs174546-rs174601) was associated with an increased risk for IS, and the haplotype of C-C (rs174546-rs174601) was associated with a reduced risk for CAD and IS. The two SNPs were likely to influence serum lipid levels. The T allele carriers of the two SNPs and rs174601 TT genotype were associated with decreased serum HDL-C and ApoAI levels in the patient groups and with an increased risk of CAD and IS. The present study suggests that the FADS1 rs174546 SNP and the FADS2 rs174601 SNP are associated with the risk of CAD and IS, and are likely to influence serum lipid levels. However, further functional studies are needed to clarify how the two SNPs actually affect serum lipid levels and the risk of CAD and IS."

26267381,26267381,Molecular Basis of Gene-Gene Interaction: Cyclic Cross-Regulation of Gene Expression and Post-GWAS Gene-Gene Interaction Involved in Atrial Fibrillation.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia at the clinic. Recent GWAS identified several variants associated with AF, but they account for <10% of heritability. Gene-gene interaction is assumed to account for a significant portion of missing heritability. Among GWAS loci for AF, only three were replicated in the Chinese Han population, including SNP rs2106261 (G/A substitution) in ZFHX3, rs2200733 (C/T substitution) near PITX2c, and rs3807989 (A/G substitution) in CAV1. Thus, we analyzed the interaction among these three AF loci. We demonstrated significant interaction between rs2106261 and rs2200733 in three independent populations and combined population with 2,020 cases/5,315 controls. Compared to non-risk genotype GGCC, two-locus risk genotype AATT showed the highest odds ratio in three independent populations and the combined population (OR=5.36 (95% CI 3.87-7.43), P=8.00×10-24). The OR of 5.36 for AATT was significantly higher than the combined OR of 3.31 for both GGTT and AACC, suggesting a synergistic interaction between rs2106261 and rs2200733. Relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) analysis also revealed significant interaction between rs2106261 and rs2200733 when exposed two copies of risk alleles (RERI=2.87, P<1.00×10-4) or exposed to one additional copy of risk allele (RERI=1.29, P<1.00×10-4). The INTERSNP program identified significant genotypic interaction between rs2106261 and rs2200733 under an additive by additive model (OR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.74-0.97, P=0.02). Mechanistically, PITX2c negatively regulates expression of miR-1, which negatively regulates expression of ZFHX3, resulting in a positive regulation of ZFHX3 by PITX2c; ZFHX3 positively regulates expression of PITX2C, resulting in a cyclic loop of cross-regulation between ZFHX3 and PITX2c. Both ZFHX3 and PITX2c regulate expression of NPPA, TBX5 and NKX2.5. These results suggest that cyclic cross-regulation of gene expression is a molecular basis for gene-gene interactions involved in genetics of complex disease traits."

Ionizing radiation is the only well-established risk factor and may result in double-strand breaks. The x-ray repair cross-complementing group 3 (XRCC3) gene plays a vital role in DNA repair through homologous recombination. We aimed at investigating the association between XRCC3 genetic polymorphisms and PTC susceptibility. Eighty-three PTC patients and 367 controls in a Chinese population were enrolled in the study. Tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified by HaploView 4.2 software. Genomic DNAs were isolated from peripheral blood samples by using TaqMan Blood DNA kits. The genotyping of XRCC3 SNPs was performed by TaqMan SNPs genotyping assay. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the association between XRCC3 SNPs and PTC susceptibility. The statistical analyses were conducted by using SPSS 13.0 software. Four tag-SNPs were initially identified by HaploView 4.2 software. Only one SNP (rs861539) was shown to be significantly associated with increased risk of PTC. There was a significant difference in smoking and drinking status between PTC cases and controls. And the stratified analysis suggested that the polymorphisms of rs861539 in XRCC3 were correlated with PTC risk in the four subgroups of smokers (ex-smokers included), non-smokers, drinkers (ex-drinkers included), and non-drinkers. The meta-analysis showed that only two studies reported a significant association between XRCC3 polymorphisms and PTC risk. In this study, we find a significant association between rs861539 polymorphisms and PTC susceptibility. However, there were inconsistent results in previous published studies. Therefore, further studies in a large population are required to gain insights into the PTC risk conferred by XRCC3 SNPs."
26249641,26249641,CARD14 gene polymorphism c.C2458T (p.Arg820Trp) is associated with clinical features of psoriasis vulgaris in a Chinese cohort.,"Genome-wide association studies have found the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) c.C2458T, at the caspase recruitment domain family member 14 (CARD14) gene, to be associated with psoriasis. But little is known about the association of c.C2458T and clinical features of psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) in a Chinese cohort. This study was undertaken to further explore the relationship between c.C2458T and risk of psoriasis in southern Chinese subjects and to evaluate the SNP effect on the clinical features of psoriasis. A case-control study was performed involving 345 PsV patients and 206 controls. The variant of c.C2458T was typed using a SNaPshot assay. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 13.0 software. In analysis of the basic situation of the sample, no difference was observed between cases and controls for age and sex. In the frequency distribution of genotypes and alleles in patients and controls, we found no association between the SNP and the risk of PsV. We performed a stratified analysis according to the age of onset, family history and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) subphenotypes. We found that the CC genotype was associated significantly with an increased familial history of PsV. The main finding of our study was that the CC genotype was more common in familial cases than in sporadic cases. However, there were no significant differences found in other subphenotypes of age of onset or PASI between patients positive and those negative for a particular phenotype. In conclusion, the SNP c.C2458T may have significant effects on heritability of PsV in our Chinese population."

26255836,26255836,Evaluation of genetic susceptibility of common variants in CACNA1D with schizophrenia in Han Chinese.,"The heritability of schizophrenia (SCZ) has been estimated to be as high as 80%, suggesting that genetic factors may play an important role in the etiology of SCZ. Cav1.2 encoded by CACNA1C and Cav1.3 encoded by CACNA1D are dominant calcium channel-forming subunits of L-type Voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels, expressed in many types of neurons. The CACNA1C has been consistently found to be a risk gene for SCZ, but it is unknown for CACNA1D. To investigate the association of CACNA1D with SCZ, we designed a two-stage case-control study, including a testing set with 1117 cases and 1815 controls and a validation set with 1430 cases and 4295 controls in Han Chinese. A total of selected 97 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CACNA1D were genotyped, and single-SNP association, imputation analysis and gender-specific association analyses were performed in the two independent datasets. None was found to associate with SCZ. Further genotype and haplotype association analyses indicated a similar pattern in the two-stage study. Our findings suggested CACNA1D might not be a risk gene for SCZ in Han Chinese population, which add to the current state of knowledge regarding the susceptibility of CACNA1D to SCZ."

26239312,26239312,Association between xanthine dehydrogenase tag single nucleotide polymorphisms and essential hypertension.,"The present study aimed to investigate the association between xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) gene polymorphism and essential hypertension in the rural Han Chinese population of Fuxin, Liaoning. Han Chinese individuals, who had lived in rural areas of Fuxin, were selected as subjects for the present study. A total of 521 unrelated patients with hypertension were selected, along with a further 533 unrelated individuals with normal blood pressure, in order to serve as controls. Five tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the XDH gene were selected. An estimation of SNP allele frequency was determined using DNA pooling and pyrosequencing methods. Prior to Bonferroni correction, T allele frequency for rs206811 was significantly higher in patients with hypertension, as compared with the controls (64.1 vs. 59.4%; P=0.031); C allele frequency for rs1042039 was significantly higher in patients with hypertension, as compared with the controls (66.1 vs. 60.6%; P=0.011), C allele frequency for rs1054889 was significantly lower in patients with hypertension, as compared with the controls (38.8 vs. 44.8%; P=0.007); and A allele frequency for rs2073316 was significantly lower in patients with hypertension, as compared with the controls (29.2 vs. 34.4%; P=0.013). However, once a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was applied, the XDH gene polymorphisms rs1042039, rs1054889, and rs2073316 were shown to be associated with hypertension (P=0.044, 0.035, and 0.039, respectively). These results suggest that the XDH gene polymorphisms rs1042039, rs1054889, and rs2073316 may be associated with hypertension in the rural Han Chinese population."

26232326,26232326,PTEN gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to oral squamous cell carcinoma in a Chinese Han population.,"The tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) plays a significant role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. However, there are no data regarding the role of PTEN polymorphisms in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). A hospital-based case-control study was conducted to investigate the potential association between PTEN polymorphisms and the risk of OSCC in a Chinese Han population. The study population comprised 201 patients with OSCC and 199 healthy controls. Seventeen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PTEN were investigated and genotyped using Sequenom Mass ARRAY and iPLEX-MALDI-TOF technology. The observed genotype frequencies of these polymorphisms were in agreement with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the control group (P > 0.05 for all). The heterozygous CT genotype was not associated with significantly increased risk for OSCC (OR = 0.89, 95 % CI = (0.55-1.42), P = 0.83), the TT genotype was not associated with increased risk for OSCC (OR = 1.01, 95 % CI = (0.58-1.74), P = 0.74) compared to the PTEN SNP rs1234224 homozygous CC genotype. Meanwhile, CT/TT variants were not associated with increased risk for OSCC compared with the CC genotype (OR = 0.93, 95 % CI = 0.60-1.44, P = 0.73). The T allele was not associated with significantly increased risk compared to the C allele (OR = 0.99, 95 % CI = 0.72-1.58, P = 0.69). Similar associations with the risk of OSCC were observed for the other genotypes of PTEN gene polymorphisms. There were no significant differences in the distribution of the genotype and allele frequencies of polymorphisms of the PTEN gene between the OSCC patients and controls in a Chinese Han population. Further studies are needed to clarify the specific roles of PTEN polymorphisms in the etiology of OSCC."
26251230,26251230,Association between rs2431697 T allele on 5q33.3 and systemic lupus erythematosus: case-control study and meta-analysis.,"rs2431697 is located on 5q33.3, between pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 and miR-146a. Several studies have estimated the association between rs2431697 and systemic lupus erythematosus risk. However, the results were inconsistent. A case-control study was carried out to explore the association between rs2431697 and systemic lupus erythematosus risk in a central Chinese population. Meta-analyses combining present with previous studies were conducted to further explore the association. Our case-control study included 322 cases and 353 controls. rs2431697 T allele was associated with increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (odds ratios (ORs) = 1.461, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.091-1.957, P = 0.011). The association was stronger between T allele and the risk of anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (OR = 2.510, 95% CI 1.545-4.077, P < 0.001). The meta-analyses included 8648 systemic lupus erythematosus patients and 10947 controls. rs2431697 T allele had an overall OR of 1.262 (95% CI 1.205-1.323, P < 0.001) under fixed-effects model. After stratified by ethnicity, I (2) reduced from 24.3 to 0 %. T allele had an OR of 1.213 (95% CI 1.145-1.284, P < 0.001) in European descendant and 1.365 (95% CI 1.259-1.480, P < 0.001) in Asian under fixed-effects model. Data on women were also extracted, and T allele had an OR of 1.337 (95% CI 1.162-1.539, P < 0.001) under random-effects model. The pooled ORs were not influenced by each study in sensitivity analyses. There were no publication biases observed in these analyses. The results from our case-control study and the meta-analyses indicate that rs2431697 T allele significantly associates with the increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus."

26221375,26221375,Association analysis of genetic variants of adiponectin gene and risk of pancreatic cancer.,"Adiponectin is a cytokine exclusively secreted from adipocyte, and could perform direct or indirect effects on anti-inflammation and anti-tumor. Previous researches have studied the correlation between plasma adiponectin levels and the risk of pancreatic cancer. So we aimed at investigating the association of genetic variants of adiponectin gene and the risk of pancreatic cancer. In this study, we genotyped 6 SNPs of adiponectin gene in a case-control study of recruited 172 patients of pancreatic cancer and 181 healthy people in Chinese Han population. The results indicated that two of the SNPs had significant associations with pancreatic cancer. Of which, the SNP rs1501299C>A decreased the risk of PC (P=0.016, OR=0.662 95% CI 0.472-0.928), while rs1065358T>C increased the risk of PC (P=0.027, OR=1.421 95% CI 1.040-1.941). Furthermore, in the clinical correlation analysis, we found rs1501299 was correlated with tumor size (P=0.026), cigarette smoking (P=0.022) and alcohol consumption (P=0.001) and rs1063538 was correlated with alcohol consumption (P=0.026). In conclusion, we provided evidences that the variants in adiponectin gene might influence the development and progression of pancreatic cancer."
26223437,26223437,FOXO3 rs12212067: T > G Association with Active Tuberculosis in Han Chinese Population.,"It is well known that the human innate immune and adaptive immune response play important role in tuberculosis (TB) infection and progress. Emerging evidence shows that FOXO3 plays an important role in the human immune system. Recent research has shown that the FOXO3 genetic variants are associated malaria infection. In this study, 268 confirmed TB patients, 321 patients with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), and 475 TB-free controls were recruited; the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12212067: T > G in FOXO3 was genotyped using predesigned TaqMan® allelic discrimination assays. The results showed that the G allele of rs12212067 in FOXO3 was more common in health control and the latent TB group compared with the active TB group (p = 0.048, odds ratio (OR) 95 % confidence intervals (CI) = 1.37 (1.00-1.89); p = 0.042, OR 95 % CI = 1.42 (1.01-1.99), respectively); furthermore, within active TB patients, the G allele of rs12212067 in FOXO3 was more frequent in extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) group compared to pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) group (p = 0.035, OR 95 % CI = 0.57 (0.33-0.97). In conclusion, this study found that rs12212067 in FOXO3 was associated with increased risk of active TB. The minor G allele might be a protection factor which was found more common in latent TB patients and healthy controls than active TB patients."

26214689,26214689,Genetic Loci Associated with Allergic Sensitization in Lithuanians.,"Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common and complex disease. It is associated with environmental as well as genetic factors. Three recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reported altogether 47 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AR or allergic sensitization (AS) in Europeans and North Americans. Two follow up studies in Swedish and Chinese replicated 15 associations. In these studies individuals were selected based on the self-reported AR, or AR/AS diagnosed using blood IgE test or skin prick test (SPT), which were performed often without restriction to specific allergens. Here we performed third replication study in Lithuanians. We used SPT and carefully selected set of allergens prevalent in Lithuania, as well as Illumina Core Exome chip for SNP detection. We genotyped 270 SPT-positive individuals (137 Betulaceae -, 174 Poaceae-, 199 Artemisia-, 70 Helianthus-, 22 Alternaria-, 22 Cladosporium-, 140 mites-, 95 cat- and 97 dog dander-sensitive cases) and 162 SPT-negative controls. We found altogether 13 known SNPs associated with AS (p ≤0.05). Three SNPs were found in Lithuanians sensitive to several allergens, and 10 SNPs were found in Lithuanians sensitive to a certain allergen. For the first time, SNP rs7775228:C was associated with patient sensitivity to dog allergens (F_A=0,269, F_U=0.180, P=0.008). Thus, careful assessment of AS allowed us to detect known genetic variants associated with AS/AR in relatively small cohort of Lithuanians."

In this study, we aim to explore the possible association between the four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs11097230, rs17001385, rs14773 and rs6836703) in ART3 gene and male infertility with spermatogenesis impairment in the Chinese population. The study population included 321 idiopathic infertile males with azoospermia or oligozoospermia and 250 fertile males. Four SNPs of ART3 gene were genotyped using the method of SNaPshot. The results showed that an SNP (rs6836703) in the intron11 region of ART3 gene is significantly associated with male infertility (odds ratio: 0.632, 95% confidence interval: 0.440-0.910). No significant associations were found between any of the other three variants (rs11097230, rs17001385 and rs14773) in ART3 gene and male infertility. SNP rs6836703 in ART3 gene may contribute to male infertility risk in the Chinese population."

26209750,26209750,BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and plasma levels in Chinese Han population with obsessive-compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.,"Anxiety disorders are a category of mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear, which include generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) used to be categorized as anxiety disorder in DSM-IV. However OCD was no longer included in anxiety disorders and came into its own category titled as Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders (OCRD) in DSM-5. It will be interesting to explore is there any different biological characteristics between OCD and anxiety disorders. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was a potential candidate gene in both OCD and GAD. The results of genetic association studies between BDNF and OCD have been inconsistent. BDNF plasma/serum levels in OCD have been found lower than those in healthy controls. However the heritable reason of the lowered BDNF levels was not well elucidated. The amount of studies about BDNF and GAD were relatively small. The aims of this study were to determine whether single nucleotide polymorphism Val66Met of BDNF was associated with OCD and GAD, to examine BDNF plasma levels in OCD and GAD, and to explore whether Val66Met variation influences BDNF plasma levels."
26211578,26211578,The single nucleotide polymorphism and haplotype analysis of MDR1 in Chinese diffuse large B cell lymphoma patients.,"We investigated whether the MDR1 (multidrug resistance 1) gene single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and haplotype variants were associated with the susceptibility to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A total of 129 DLBCL patients and 208 healthy controls from Jiangsu Han population were enrolled in this study. They were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-allele specific primers (PCR-ASP) method or DNA direct sequencing at three common loci: C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T. At locus G2677T/A, allele G and genotype GT were significantly more common in DLBCL (G: OR=1.48, 95% CI: 1.08-2.02, Pc=0.03; GT: OR=1.96, 95% CI: 1.25-3.07, Pc<0.01), while genotype AT in this locus seemed to be protective (OR=0.29, 95% CI: 0.02-0.72, Pc=0.03). TT genotype at locus C3435T showed a risk factor in DLBCL (OR=2.38, 95% CI: 1.52-3.74, Pc<0.01). The frequency of T-G-T haplotype was significantly increased in DLBCL group (OR=5.21, 95% CI: 2.58-10.54, Pc<0.01); haplotype of G-T in 2677-3435 and diplotype of 2677GT/3435TT were significantly more frequent in DLBCL group (G-T: OR=3.97, 95% CI: 2.31-6.85, Pc<0.01; 2677GT/3435TT: OR=4.55, 95% CI: 2.02-10.22, Pc<0.01). Our findings demonstrate that G, GT at locus G2677T/A, and TT at locus C3435T might contribute to the susceptibility to DLBCL, as well as haplotype of T-G-T, G-T in 2677-3435 and diplotype of 2677GT/3435TT, while AT at locus G2677T/A might be a protective genotype. These findings could provide evidence that the MDR1 SNPs may modify the susceptibility to DLBCL and shade new lights in disease association studies."

Using whole exome sequencing, we identified a missense variant (c.130C>T, p.R44C) in the MCM2 gene, which has a pro-apoptosis effect and is involved in the initiation of eukaryotic genome replication. This missense variant is very likely to be the disease causing variant. It segregated with hearing loss in this pedigree, and was not found in the dbSNP database or databases of genomes and SNP in the Chinese population, in 76 patients with sporadic hearing loss, or in 145 normal individuals. We performed western blot and immunofluorescence to test the MCM2 protein expression in the cochlea of rats and guinea pigs, demonstrating that MCM2 was widely expressed in the cochlea and was also surprisingly expressed in the cytoplasm of terminally differentiated hair cells. We then transiently expressed the variant MCM2 cDNA in HEK293 cells, and found that these cells displayed a slight increase in apoptosis without any changes in proliferation or cell cycle, supporting the view that this variant is pathogenic. In summary, we have identified MCM2 as a novel gene responsible for nonsyndromic hearing loss of autosomal dominant inheritance in a Chinese family."

Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and genotyping for TNF-α/rs1799724 and CXCL12/rs266085 was carried out using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays. TNF-α/rs1799724 polymorphism showed the C-allele was less prevalent among cases as compared to controls (74.3% vs. 92.0%), while the T-allele was more prevalent among cases (P=0.000, OR=3.99, 95% C.I.: 2.90-5.51). CXCL12/rs266085 polymorphism showed the C-allele was less prevalent among cases as compared to controls (41.2% vs. 49.7%), while the T-allele was more prevalent among cases (P=0.001, OR=1.41, 95% C.I.: 1.14-1.74). The genotype and allele frequencies of these two SNPs did not differ between CIS and invasive squamous cell carcinoma (P>0.05). Moreover, the allele frequencies of rs1799724 were significantly different between controls without or with HPV infection (P<0.05). Neither the genotype nor allele frequencies of rs266085 were statistically different between HPV-negative and positive controls. TNF-α/rs1799724 and CXCL12/rs266085 polymorphisms are associated with cervical cancer. C->T polymorphism of these two SNPs and HPV infection are linked to high risk for cervical cancer."

26204268,26204268,Schizophrenia Related Variants in CACNA1C also Confer Risk of Autism.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders with a strong genetic component. Many lines of evidence indicated that ASD shares common genetic variants with other psychiatric disorders (for example, schizophrenia). Previous studies detected that calcium channels are involved in the etiology of many psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and autism. Significant association between CACNA1C (calcium channel, voltage-dependent, L type, alpha 1C subunit) and schizophrenia was detected. Furthermore, rare mutation in CACNA1C is suggested to cause Timothy syndrome, a multisystem disorder including autism-associated phenotype. However, there is no evidence for association between CACNA1C and autism in Chinese Han population. To investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in CACNA1C and autism, we first performed a family-based association study between eighteen SNPs in CACNA1C and autism in 239 trios. All SNPs were genotyped by using Sequenom genotyping platform. Two SNPs (rs1006737 and rs4765905) have a trend of association with autism. To further confirm the association between these two SNPs with autism, we expanded the sample size to 553 trios by adding 314 trios. Association analyses for SNPs and haplotype were performed by using family-based association test (FBAT) and Haploview software. Permutation tests were used for multiple testing corrections of the haplotype analyses (n=10,000). The significance level for all statistical tests was two-tailed (p<0.05). The results demonstrated that G allele of rs1006737 and G allele of rs4765905 showed a preferential transmission to affected offspring in 553 trios (p=0.035). Haplotype analyses showed that two haplotypes constructed from rs1006737 and rs4765905 were significantly associated with autism (p=0.030, 0.023, respectively; Global p=0.046). These results were still significant after permutation correction (n=10,000, p=0.027). Our research suggests that CACNA1C might play a role in the genetic etiology of autism in Chinese Han population."

26168879,26168879,The Effect of SCN9A Variation on Basal Pain Sensitivity in the General Population: An Experimental Study in Young Women.,"SCN9A is a key player in various rare monogenic pain disorders, including absence of pain or extreme pain, indicating that SCN9A is critical in human pain perception. This study aimed to investigate the association between the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SCN9A and basal pain sensitivity variability in the general population. We used a combined tag and candidate SNP approach to explore possible associations between SCN9A SNPs and basal pain sensitivity in 309 healthy female Chinese undergraduates. Mechanical and heat pain sensitivity were measured, and a total of 28 SNPs were included in the final correlation analysis. Four candidate SNPs (rs6746030, rs7595255, rs12622743, and rs11898284) and 10 tag SNPs were associated (P < .05) with different pain perception phenotypes and exhibited opposite effects, resulting in either hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity. Furthermore, of all these SNPs, rs16851778 showed the strongest significant (P = .003) association with lower mechanical pain sensitivity, which was strengthened in a subsequent replication sample with 260 young patients scheduled for elective gynecological surgery. These findings provided evidence that the variability of basal pain sensitivity was associated with SCN9A polymorphisms in the general population."
26163701,26163701,Establishment of a 100-seed weight quantitative trait locus-allele matrix of the germplasm population for optimal recombination design in soybean breeding programmes.,"A representative sample comprising 366 accessions from the Chinese soybean landrace population (CSLRP) was tested under four growth environments for determination of the whole-genome quantitative trait loci (QTLs) system of the 100-seed weight trait (ranging from 4.59g to 40.35g) through genome-wide association study (GWAS). A total of 116 769 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified and organized into 29 121 SNP linkage disequilibrium blocks (SNPLDBs) to fit the property of multiple alleles/haplotypes per locus in germplasm. An innovative two-stage GWAS was conducted using a single locus model for shrinking the marker number followed by a multiple loci model utilizing a stepwise regression for the whole-genome QTL identification. In total, 98.45% of the phenotypic variance (PV) was accounted for by four large-contribution major QTLs (36.33%), 51 small-contribution major QTLs (43.24%), and a number of unmapped minor QTLs (18.88%), with the QTL×environment variance representing only 1.01% of the PV. The allele numbers of each QTL ranged from two to 10. A total of 263 alleles along with the respective allele effects were estimated and organized into a 263×366 matrix, giving the compact genetic constitution of the CSLRP. Differentiations among the ecoregion matrices were found. No landrace had alleles which were all positive or all negative, indicating a hidden potential for recombination. The optimal crosses within and among ecoregions were predicted, and showed great transgressive potential. From the QTL system, 39 candidate genes were annotated, of which 26 were involved with the gene ontology categories of biological process, cellular component, and molecular function, indicating that diverse genes are involved in directing the 100-seed weight."
26167925,26167925,Genetic Variants of IκB Kinase β (IKBKB) and Polymerase β (POLB) Were Not Associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Risk in a Chinese Han Population.,"A previous large-scale replication study validation of a genome wide association study (GWAS) identified IκB kinase β (IKBKB) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as a risk factor associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a Chinese Han population. IKBKB SNPs were associated with polymerase β (POLB) SNPs and reduced POLB expression, and this was proposed to be an underlying cause of human SLE development. In the current case-control study, we evaluated IKBKB (rs12676482 and rs2272733) and POLB (rs3136717 and rs3136744) SNPs in 946 SLE patients and 961 healthy controls. We investigated the possible association of these four SNPs with SLE in a Chinese Han population using the polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR) technique. The differences in the frequencies of the four SNP alleles and the genotypes and haplotypes of the POLB polymorphisms were statistically insignificant when the SLE patients were compared with the controls in the Chinese Han population enrolled in this study (all, p ˃ 0.05). Furthermore, no associations were detected using different genetic models (additive, dominant, and recessive; all, p ˃ 0.05). Our findings indicate that the IKBKB (rs12676482 and rs2272733) and POLB (rs3136717, rs3136744) SNPs confer no genetic predisposition to SLE risk in this Chinese Han population."

This study was aimed at investigating whether the SNP might also contribute to HCC susceptibility in the Thai population. Study subjects were enrolled and divided into 3 groups including CHB-related HCC (n=211), CHB without HCC (n=233) and healthy controls (n=206). The SNP was genotyped using allelic discrimination assays based on TaqMan real-time PCR. Data analysis revealed that the distribution of different genotypes was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P>0.05). The frequencies of allele T (major allele) in HCC patients, CHB patients and healthy controls were 51.4%, 58.6% and 61.4%, respectively, whereas the frequencies of C allele (minor allele) were 48.6%, 41.4% and 38.6%. The C allele frequency was higher in HCC when compared with CHB patients (odds ratio (OR)=1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.02-1.74, P=0.032). The genotype of SNP rs1053004 (CC versus TT+TC) was significantly associated with an increased risk when compared with CHB patients (OR=1.83, 95% CI=1.13-2.99, P=0.015). In addition, we observed a similar trend of association when comparing HCC patients with healthy controls (OR=1.77, 95% CI=1.07-2.93, P=0.025) and all controls (OR=1.81, 95% CI=1.19-2.74, P=0.005). These findings suggest that the SNP rs1053004 in STAT3 might contribute to HCC susceptibility and could be used as a genetic marker for HCC in the Thai population."
26176736,26176736,Genetic association of complement component 2 polymorphism with systemic lupus erythematosus.,"Complement component 2 (C2), an early member of the classical pathway, mainly participates in apoptotic cell clearance. We hypothesize that C2 polymorphism may confer genetic susceptibility to complement dysfunction in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The major aim of our study was to investigate the clinical and serological associations of C2 variants in Chinese patients with SLE. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2844455, G/A SNP) located in the intron region of C2 gene was genotyped by direct sequencing in 95 SLE patients and 95 matched normal control subjects. The gene expression profiles were generated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription PCR. Our results showed that the AA genotype was observed more frequently in SLE patients than in normal control subjects (22.1% vs 9.5%, P < 0.05). The A allele was strongly associated with the occurrence of hair loss, photosensitivity and anti-cardiolipin antibodies; whereas, the G allele was associated with lower frequencies of these clinical presentations. Relative expression levels were significantly lower in patients with the AA genotype [median: 18.86, interquartile range (IQR) 11.36-22.43, P = 0.002] than in those with the GG genotype (35.76, IQR: 19.33-49.71). As expected, we confirmed the A allele as a risk factor for SLE development in a Chinese population, in contrast, the G allele might be a protective factor against the pathogenic autoantibody formation and cutaneous manifestations in SLE patients."
26141218,26141218,"IL1B gene polymorphisms, age and the risk of non-small cell lung cancer in a Chinese population.","IL1B rs12621220G/A (-3893), rs1143623G/C (-1464), rs16944T/C (-511) and rs1143627C/T (-31) were previously reported to be associated with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and formed a specific haplotype (GGCT) which was associated with increased IL1B gene expression and increased risk of NSCLC in European populations. Only the two SNPs of rs16944T/C (-511) and rs1143627C/T (-31) have been studied in Chinese populations, and the results were conflicting. Thus we studied the association of the above four SNPs with NSCLC in a large Chinese population."

26125895,26125895,Intracranial aneurysm risk factor genes: relationship with intracranial aneurysm risk in a Chinese Han population.,"Few studies have examined the genes related to risk fac-tors that may contribute to intracranial aneurysms (IAs). This study in Chinese patients aimed to explore the relationship between IA and 28 gene loci, proven to be associated with risk factors for IA. We recruited 119 patients with aneurysms and 257 controls. Single factor and logistic regression models were used to analyze the association of IA and IA rup-ture with risk factors. Twenty-eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 22 genes were genotyped for the patient and control groups. SNP genotypes and allele frequencies were analyzed by the chi-square test. Logistic regression analysis identified hypertension as a factor that increased IA risk (P = 1.0 x 10(-4); OR, 2.500; 95%CI, 1.573-3.972); IA was associated with two SNPs in the TSLC2A9 gene: rs7660895 (P = 0.007; OR, 1.541; 95%CI, 1.126-2.110); and in the TOX gene: rs11777927 (P = 0.013; OR, 1.511; 95%CI, 1.088-2.098). Subsequent removal of the influence of family relationship identified between 12 of 119 patients enhanced the significant association of these SNPs with IA (P = 0.001; OR, 1.691; 95%CI, 1.226-2.332; and P = 0.006; OR, 1.587; 95%CI, 1.137-2.213 for rs7660895 and rs11777927, respectively). Fur-thermore, the minor allele of rs7660895 (A) was also associated with IA rupture (P = 0.007; OR, 2.196; 95%CI, 1.230-3.921). Therefore, hypertension is an independent risk factor for IA. Importantly, the TSL-C2A9 (rs7660895) and TOX (rs11777927) gene polymorphisms may be associated with formation of IAs, and rs7660895 may be associated with IA rupture."
26125784,26125784,Cyclin D1 G870A polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of multiple myeloma.,"Cyclin D1 is an important cell cycle regulator implicated in the pathogenesis of many cancer types. In particular, translocation and overexpression of cyclin D1 are common events in multiple myeloma (MM), suggesting that it may drive the initiation and progression of this malignancy. However, the association between genetic polymorphisms of cyclin D1 and the risk for developing MM remains poorly characterized. We performed a case-control study with 67 patients with MM and 66 healthy controls in a Chinese population. The cancer-associated G870A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of CCND1, the gene encoding cyclin D1, was determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. We found that there was a strong association between the homozygous variant allele  (GG) and MM susceptibility, with an odds ratio (OR) of 4.679 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.081-5.647]. When further stratified analysis was performed, the increased risk was only evident in individuals over 60 years old (OR=3.297; 95%CI: 1.058-10.276). Our results suggest that the CCND1 G870A SNP may be critically involved in MM development."
26139146,26139146,TOX and CDKN2A/B Gene Polymorphisms Are Associated with Type 2 Diabetes in Han Chinese.,"To study associations between type 2 diabetes (T2DM) candidate genes and microvascular complications of diabetes (MVCDs), we performed case-control association studies for both T2DM and MVCDs in Han Chinese subjects. We recruited 1,939 unrelated Han Chinese T2DM patients and 918 individuals with normal blood glucose levels as nondiabetic controls. Among T2DM patients, 1116 have MVCDs, 266 have a history of T2DM of >10 years but never developed MVCDs. Eighty-two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 54 candidate genes were genotyped. Discrete association studies were performed by the PLINK program for T2DM and MVCDs. Significant associations were found among candidate gene SNPs and T2DM, including rs1526167 of the TOX gene (allele A, P = 2.85 × 10(-9), OR = 1.44). The SNP rs10811661 of the CDKN2A/B gene was also associated with T2DM (allele T, P = 4.09 × 10(-7), OR = 1.36). When we used control patients with >10 years of T2DM history without MVCD, we found that the G allele of SNP rs1526167 of the TOX gene was associated with MVCD (nominal P = 4.33 × 10(-4)). In our study, significant associations were found between TOX and CDKN2A/B gene SNPs and T2DM. The TOX polymorphism might account for the higher risk of T2DM and the lower risk of MVCDs in the Han Chinese population."
26154111,26154111,Association study of single nucleotide polymorphisms in JAK2 and STAT5B genes and their differential mRNA expression with mastitis susceptibility in Chinese Holstein cattle.,"The JAK-STAT pathway plays a key role in mediating immune responses. The genetic effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in JAK2 and STAT5B were investigated for serum cytokines, mastitis indicators and productions traits in a population of 468 Chinese Holstein cattle. Pooled DNA sequencing revealed one SNP (BTA8:g.39645396A>G) in JAK2 and two SNPs (BTA19:g.43673888A>G and BTA19:g.43660093T>C) in STAT5B. A fixed effect model considering the effects of SNPs, parity, herd, season and year of calving was used by way of the general linear model procedure of sas. Genotype frequencies of these SNPs in the population were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P > 0.05). A novel SNP (g.39645396A>G) in JAK2 was predicted to change the amino acid from lysine to asparagine and was significantly associated with the somatic cell count (SCC) and somatic cell score (SCS), whereas g.43673888A>G in STAT5B was significantly associated with SCC, SCS and interleukin-4 (IL-4) (P < 0.05). The dominant effect of g.39645396A>G in JAK2 was significant for SCS, and its additive effect was significant for SCC, whereas the dominant effect of g.43673888A>G in STAT5B was significant for SCS and IL-4 (P < 0.05). The combination of g.39645396A>G in JAK2 and g.43673888A>G in STAT5B showed a significant effect on SCC, SCS, IL-4 and TNF-α (P < 0.05). As for mRNA expression analysis, the AA genotype g.39645396A>G and GG genotype g.43673888A>G indicated higher mRNA expression level and were significantly different from other genotypes (P < 0.05). The results imply that JAK2 and STAT5B genes could be useful candidate genes, and the identified polymorphisms might potentially be strong genetic markers for selection of dairy cattle against mastitis development."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the associations between major depressive disorder and relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CREB1 gene. A total of 1,038 subjects of Han Chinese descent were recruited, including 456 patients with major depressive disorder (case group) and 582 healthy volunteers (control group). The frequency distributions of the genotypes and alleles were estimated in the case and control groups, and analyzed for any correlation with major depressive disorder. Three relevant SNP sites in CREB1 were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and statistical analyses were performed to estimate their use as risk factors for major depressive disorder. The analyses revealed that rs2254137 and rs16839883 in CREB1 showed polymorphisms in the sample population, and the genotype and allele frequencies of rs16839883 differed significantly when comparing the patients and healthy controls ("

26109858,26109858,An exploratory study of the association between SORL1 polymorphisms and sporadic Alzheimer's disease in the Han Chinese population.,"In previous studies, we reported that the sortilin-related receptor, L (DLR class) A repeats containing (SORL1) gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with the risk of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD) in the Han Chinese population. To further explore the relationships between SORL1 genetic variants and SAD, we conducted a two-step study. Sequencing analysis in 50 case samples identified 14 SNPs within the promoter and untranslated region of the SORL1 gene. Subsequent genotyping analysis in 106 patients with SAD and 179 healthy controls detected a significant association between the ""G"" allele of SNP rs1133174 in the 3' untranslated region of the SORL1 gene and SAD risk (odds ratio =1.92, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] =1.28-2.90, adjusted P=0.028). In addition, ""G"" allele carriers of rs1133174 (GA + GG) have a 2.15-fold increased risk of SAD compared to noncarriers (AA) (adjusted P=0.042). However, no significant positive associations were observed in the other 13 SNPs within the SORL1 gene. These preliminary findings suggest that the SORL1 SNP rs1133174 may be a potential risk locus for SAD in the Han Chinese population."
26115041,26115041,SNP rs2057482 in HIF1A gene predicts clinical outcome of aggressive hepatocellular carcinoma patients after surgery.,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) plays an important role in tumor growth and metastasis. Genetic variations of HIF1A gene have been shown to influence the developing risk and prognosis in many types of human malignancies. However, their association with clinical outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients remains unclear. To investigate the predictive role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HIF1A gene in HCC patients' outcomes, we genotyped three functional SNPs (rs2057482, rs1957757 and rs2301113) in HIF1A gene and assessed their associations with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis of 492 surgical HCC patients. The patients with variant alleles (CT+TT) of SNP rs2057482 had a significantly lower recurrence risk when compared with patients with the CC genotype. In stratified analysis, the protective effect of rs2057482 CT+TT genotype was more evident in patients with adverse strata, compared with patients with favorable strata. Additionally, strong joint predictive effect between rs2057482 genotypes and AFP level, stage or differentiation were observed. Functional assay also indicated the significant effect of rs2057482 on gene expression. In conclusion, SNP rs2057482 in HIF1A gene is significantly associated with clinical outcomes of Chinese HCC patients after surgery, especially in those with aggressive status, which warrants further validation in other patient populations."
26125814,26125814,Association between TNFSF4 tagSNPs and myocardial infarction in a Chinese Han population.,"Tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 4 (TNFSF4) plays an important role in atherosclerosis development. However, the biological significance of TNFSF4 variants on myocardial infarction (MI) pathogenesis remains poorly understood. We investigated the influence of 5 TNFSF4 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs3861950, rs17346501, rs7518045, rs1234313, and rs3850641) on individual susceptibility to MI in a Chinese population of 285 MI patients and 645 controls. Genotyping was performed using the polymerase chain reaction-ligase detection reaction method. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, only the TNFSF4 tagging single nucleotide polymorphism rs7518045 exhibited a significant effect on MI risk; A allele (odds ratio = 0.68, 95% confidence interval = 0.46-1.00, P = 0.048) and AA genotype (odds ratio = 0.64, 95% confidence interval = 0.42-0.97, P = 0.036) were associated with a decreased risk of MI compared with the G allele and the combined AG/GG genotype, respectively. Moreover, the haplotype rs3861950C-rs17346501C-rs7518045A-rs1234313G containing the rs7518045 A allele also exhibited a significant association with a decreased risk for MI (odds ratio = 0.42, 95% confidence interval = 0.21-0.84, P = 0.011). Our study showed that the A allele of the rs7518045 and haplotype rs3861950C-rs17346501C-rs7518045A-rs1234313G in the TNFSF4 gene were associated with decreased MI risk in a Chinese Han population. Further studies using larger sample sizes and in diverse ethnic populations are needed to confirm the general validity of our findings."

26092620,26092620,A2BP1 gene polymorphisms association with olanzapine-induced weight gain.,"The ataxin-2 binding protein 1 (A2BP1) gene is reported to be one of the susceptibility genes in schizophrenia, autism, and obesity. The aim of this study was to explore the association of A2BP1 gene polymorphisms with antipsychotic induced weight gain (AIWG) in Chinese Han population. Three hundred and twenty-eight patients with schizophrenia were followed-up for an 8-week period of treatment with olanzapine. The fasting weights of 328 patients were measured before and after the 8-week course of treatment. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs: rs8048076, rs1478697, rs10500331, and rs4786847) of the A2BP1 gene were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We analyzed putative association of A2BP1 polymorphisms with AIWG of olanzapine using linear regression analysis and found that SNP rs1478697 was significantly associated with AIWG caused by olanzapine (p=0.0012; Bonferroni corrected p=0.0048). The association was replicated in another independent sample including 208 first-episode and drug-naïve patients presenting with schizophrenia after a 4-week treatment with olanzapine (p=0.0092; Bonferroni corrected p=0.0368; meta p=5.33×10(-5)). To explore the biological plausibility of A2BP1 in the pathogenesis of AIWG, we made expression analyses and eQTL analyses; these analyses showed that A2BP1 was highly expressed in whole brain tissues using the HBT database, and that rs1478697 has an expression quantitative trait locus effect in human cerebellar cortex tissues using the BRAINEAC database (p=2.50E-04). In conclusion, the rs1478697 in A2BP1 may be associated with AIWG induced by 8-week treatment with olanzapine."
26079504,26079504,Genetic polymorphisms of interleukin-6 gene and susceptibility to coronary artery disease in Chinese population: Evidence based on 4582 subjects.,"The aim of this study was to explore whether interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene (-174 G/C and -572 C/G) polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to coronary artery disease (CAD) risk in Chinese population. All the statistical tests were performed using Stata version 11.0. Twelve articles involving 16 studies were included in this meta-analysis, covering a total of 2309 CAD cases and 2273 controls. For IL-6 gene -572 C/G polymorphism, the results showed evidence for significant association between IL-6 gene -572 C/G polymorphism and CAD risk (for G allele vs. C allele: OR=1.48, 95% CI=1.26-1.74, p<0.001; for G/G vs. C/C: OR=2.60, 95% CI=1.54-4.39, p<0.001; for G/G vs. G/C+C/C: OR=2.15, 95% CI=1.35-3.42, p=0.001; for G/G+G/C vs. C/C: OR=1.55, 95% CI=1.29-1.85, p<0.001). However, for IL-6 gene -174 G/C polymorphism, no significant association was found between this variation and CAD risk. In summary, our meta-analysis showed evidence that IL-6 gene -572 C/G polymorphism may be a risk factor for CAD susceptibility. For IL-6 gene -174 G/C polymorphism, no significant association was found between this variation and CAD risk."

26085717,26085717,Identification of XRCC1 Arg399Gln and XRCC3 Thr241Met Polymorphisms in a Turkish Population and Their Association with the Risk of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,"DNA repair systems are essential for cellular functions. Defects due to sequence variations in DNA repair genes can lead severe failure of cell functions and causing many cancer types including leukemia. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between XRCC1 Arg399Gln and XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphisms and susceptibility to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in Turkish patients. In addition, genotype distribution of these polymorphisms was compared with other populations. The frequencies of Arg399Gln and Thr241Met single nucleotide polymorphisms were studied in 25 CLL patients and 30 healthy individuals. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped by PCR-RFLP method. The genotype and allele frequencies of Arg399Gln and Thr241Met polymorphisms were not statistically different between the CLL patients and control group. The allelic frequency similarities were found between Turkish and Brazilian populations for Arg399Gln polymorphism. On the other hand, similarities were found between Turkish and other Caucasian populations for Thr241Met polymorphism. Marked differences were observed between American African versus Turkish and Chinese versus Turkish populations for Arg399Gln and Thr241Met polymorphisms respectively. These results indicate that Arg399Gln and Thr241Met polymorphisms were not associated with the development of CLL in Turkish population and ethnic differences is one of the most important factor for allele frequency differences."

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor, the kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), are involved in the angiogenesis of cancers. In this study, we investigate whether the polymorphisms of VEGF and KDR are associated with a glioma risk. Blood samples were collected from 477 glioma patients and 477 healthy controls. Five tag-single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of KDR were obtained from the HapMap database, and eight tag-SNPs of VEGF were selected based on previous studies. After extraction of genomic DNAs by a Qiagen DNA blood kit, the SNPs of VEGF and KDR were genotyped with a Sequenom MassArray iPLEX platform and further analyzed with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The odds ratios and their 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to assess the association between VEGF, KDR polymorphisms, and glioma risks with the aid of SPSS 13.0 software. The haplotype analysis demonstrated that two SNPs of VEGF [rs3025039 (C>T), rs2010963 (G>C)] could elevate the susceptibility to a glioma in the homozygous model [odds ratio (OR) = 3.13 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-7.49, P = 0.007) and OR = 1.58 (95% CI 1.07-2.34, P = 0.022), respectively], dominant model [OR = 1.38 (95% CI 1.04-1.84, P = 0.025) and OR = 1.32 (95% CI 1.01-1.72, P = 0.043), respectively], and allelic model [OR = 1.43 (95% CI 1.11-1.84, P = 0.005) and OR = 1.24 (95% CI 1.04-1.50, P = 0.019), respectively]. Furthermore, three SNPs of KDR [rs7667298 (A>G), rs2305948 (C>T), rs1870377 (T>A)] were also assumed to be associated with an increased risk of a glioma in the homozygous [OR = 1.93 (95% CI 1.30-2.86, P = 0.001), OR = 2.56 (95% CI 1.28-5.11, P = 0.006), and OR = 1.52 (95% CI 1.00-2.31, P = 0.049), respectively], dominant [OR = 1.52 (95% CI 1.16-1.98, P = 0.002), OR = 1.41 (95% CI 1.05-1.87, P = 0.020), and OR = 1.48 (95% CI 1.13-1.93, P = 0.004), respectively], and allele models [OR = 1.39 (95% CI 1.15-1.67, P = 0.001), OR = 1.47 (95% CI 1.14-1.89, P = 0.002), and OR = 1.27 (95% CI 1.05-1.52, P = 0.013), respectively].

Additional functional and association studies with different ethnic groups included are needed to further confirm our results."
26074057,26074057,Association of Inducible T Cell Costimulator Polymorphisms with Susceptibility and Outcome of Hepatitis B Virus Infection in a Chinese Han Population.,"Inducible T cell costimulator (ICOS) functions to regulate cell-cell signalling, immune responses and cell proliferation. ICOS single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may affect protein expression and functions. This study investigated the association of ICOS SNPs with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and outcome in a Chinese population. A total of 1290 Chinese Han individuals were enrolled, including 63 asymptomatic HBV carriers, 220 chronic hepatitis B patients (CHB), 249 HBV-related liver cirrhosis patients (LC), 108 patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 338 patients with natural HBV clearance and 312 healthy subjects (as controls). DNA samples from these subjects were genotyped for four ICOS SNPs (rs11883722, rs10932029, rs1559931 and rs4675379) using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay and analysed. The data showed that genotype and allele frequencies of ICOS SNPs in cases and controls followed the Hardy-Weinberg distribution. The CC genotype of rs4675379 was higher in patients with HBV infection (including AC, CHB, LC and HCC) than in patients with HBV clearance (P = 0.006). Furthermore, the genotype 'GA' and the minor allele 'A' of rs1559931 were associated with a decreased HCC susceptibility (P < 0.001). Haplotype analysis data showed that 'GC' haplotype in block 2 (rs1559931 and rs4675379) had a lower frequency in patients than in HBV-cleared subjects (P = 0.034), although its overall frequency was only 1.6%. Our study found that ICOS rs1559931 SNP was associated with decreased HBV-related HCC risk in the studied Chinese Han population, except for patients with natural clearance of HBV."

Considering the overlapping of clinical manifestation and pathologic characteristics of PD and multiple system atrophy (MSA), we conducted a large-sample study to investigate the associations between this variant and these two neurodegenerative diseases in a Chinese population. A total of 1216 PD, 406 MSA patients, and 869 healthy controls were included. All cases were genotyped for the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) using Sequenom iPLEX Assay technology. The rs75932628-T variant of the TREM2 gene was not identified in PD patients and controls. The genotype frequency of rs75932628-T SNP in MSA patients was 0.25% (1/406). However, no significant correlation was identified between this variant and the risk for MSA. TREM2 rs75932628 is unlikely to play a major role in the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative diseases. Our findings argue against a generalized immune dysfunction triggered by the variant in the TREM2 gene."

Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs rs1395821, rs1878406, rs5333, rs1800541, and rs5370) of the EDNRA and EDN1 gene were examined in 480 participants from 160 families. The IMT protocol involves scanning the common carotid arteries (CCAs), the carotid bifurcations (bulb), and the origins (first 1 cm) of the internal carotid arteries (ICAs). Generalized linear models with a generalized estimating equation were employed to consider the dependence among family members. After multivariate adjustment, the effects of interactions between EDNRA and EDN1 gene with gender, obesity, and exercise were observed. For gene-gender interaction on CCA IMT, the adjusted mean for men carrying the GA/GG genotype of EDNRASNP rs1878406 was 1.18 times higher than that for men carrying the AA genotype (95% CI: 1.01, 1.37). As for bulb and ICA IMT, the adjusted mean values for women carrying the AC/AA genotype of EDN1 rs5370 was lower than those carrying the CC genotype: 0.89, [0.82, 0.98]; and 0.90 [0.83, 0.99], respectively. We did observe significant effects of EDNRA SNPs rs1395821 and rs5333 in individuals who regularly exercised. A significantly lower adjusted mean in CCA IMT for non-obese individuals carrying EDNRA SNP rs5333 was observed (0.92 [0.86, 0.99]) compared with non-obese individuals carrying the AA genotype. This study first reported significant interactions of EDNRA and EDN1 polymorphisms with gender, regular exercise, and obesity on carotid IMT in Han Chinese participants."

In this study, we evaluated the potential association of FCRL3 polymorphisms with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) in a Chinese Han population. Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FCRL3-rs945635, rs3761959, rs7522061, rs10489678, and rs7528684-were genotyped in 630 patients with SSNHL and 600 healthy controls by using a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. The allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies in the patients and the controls were compared using a χ(2) test. Moreover, we performed haplotype analysis by using the online software platform SHEsis. The results revealed a significant association between three SNPs-rs7528684, rs3761959, and rs7522061-and SSNHL in the studied Chinese Han population. Furthermore, the AGT and GAC haplotypes were associated with a significantly higher prevalence of SSNHL than were the GAT, GGC and GGT haplotypes. However, no significant differences were detected in either the genotype or allele frequencies of the other two SNPs, rs945635 and rs10489678, between the SSNHL and control groups. Overall, this study has identified an association between FCRL3 polymorphisms and increased risk of SSNHL in a Chinese Han population."

However, its biological role in breast cancer has not been reported. To test whether WT1 SNPs can be used as a molecular marker in order to improve the risk stratification of breast cancer, we performed a case-control study including 709 female sporadic breast cancer patients and 749 female healthy control subjects in the Southeast China. Five WT1 SNPs (rs16754, rs3930513, rs5030141, rs5030317, rs5030320) were selected and determined by polymerase chain reaction-ligase detection reaction to assess their associations with breast cancer risk. Results showed the distributions of the alleles of these WT1 SNPs were consistent with data from Chinese population as suggested by the International HapMap Project. Individuals with the minor alleles of rs16754, rs5030317 and rs5030320 showed a significant decrease of breast cancer risk in codominant model (OR = 0.6370, 95% CI: 0.4260-0.9520 for rs16754; OR = 0.5940, 95% CI: 0.3890-0.9070 for rs5030317; OR = 0.5870, 95% CI: 0.3850-0.8960 for 5030320, respectively) and recessive model. Stratified analyses showed the protective effects were more evident in the subjects with age ≤ 50 years or in pre-menopausal status. To explore the potential mechanism, we conducted bioinformatics genotype-phenotype correlation analysis, and found that the mRNA expression level for homozygous rare allele of WT1 gene was lower than that in wild-type and heterozygous group (P = 0.0021) in Chinese population. In summary, our findings indicated that minor alleles of rs16754, rs5030317 and rs5030320 are associated with reduced risk of breast cancer, suggesting that WT1 SNPs may be a potential biomarker of individualized prediction of susceptibility to breast cancer. However, large prospective and molecular epidemiology studies are needed to verify this correlation and clarify its underlying mechanisms."

Two previous studies indicated that SNPs in UBE2E2 were associated with risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the Japanese and Korean populations, respectively. We examined the association of one SNP in this gene, rs7612463, with the risk of T2DM in 1957 Han participants in northeastern China, using an SNPscan(TM) Kit. rs7612463 genotype was significantly associated with risk for T2DM under various genetic models, including an additive model (P = 0.004), a dominant model (P = 0.024), and a recessive model (P = 0.008). The AA genotype was associated with a significantly decreased risk for T2DM (P = 0.004, OR = 0.513, 95% CI = 0.325-0.810) after adjustment for age, gender, and BMI. The heterozygous genotype, AC, was associated with increased risk for total cholesterol (mmol l-1; P = 0.031) and triglycerides (mmol l-1; P = 0.039) in control individuals. Our results show that rs7612463 is associated with T2DM, with homozygotes of the AA genotype at decreased risk for T2DM in the Chinese population. Additionally, heterozygotes may have decreased risk of T2DM due to insulin resistance."

26026656,26026656,Ethnicity-stratified analysis of the association between IL-18 polymorphisms and systemic lupus erythematosus in a European population: a meta-analysis.,"We performed a meta-analysis to identify the association between polymorphisms in the promoter of interleukin-18 (IL-18) and susceptibility for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) . Genotype data for three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs rs360719, rs1946518, and rs187238) in the IL-18 promoter were extracted from 20 studies of three different ethnicities (European, Asian, and South American). Data from each ethnicity group and their combinations were analyzed. We found distinct evidence of an association between rs360719 and SLE (P = 0.001) in the European/South American group [odds ratio (OR) 1.31 per C allele, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.53]. Stratification analysis by ethnicity showed a significant association between rs360719 and SLE in the European population (OR 1.33 per C allele, 95% CI 1.11-1.61, P = 0.003) and a lesser effect in the same direction in the South American population (OR 1.18). A significant association was also identified between rs1946518 and SLE in the European population (OR 1.16 per A allele, 95% CI 1.03-1.30, P = 0.017), although there was no association in the Asian or the combined European/Asian population. We also examined genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from an Asian subpopulation (Chinese) for the association between rs1946518 and SLE, but found no association (P = 0.83). The third SNP, rs187238, was not significantly associated with SLE in any of the populations examined. In summary, this study identified a significant association between SLE and two SNPs within the IL-18 gene promoter region (rs360719 and rs1946518) in a European population, but not in populations of Asian origin."
26017031,26017031,Genetic variant near TERC influencing the risk of gliomas with older age at diagnosis in a Chinese population.,"A recent genome-wide association study has identified an association between rs1920116 near TERC and high-grade glioma in populations of European ancestry. In order to evaluate the effect of the SNP rs1920116 near TERC in the Chinese population, we examined associations of this candidate SNP with glioma in a sample of 1970 Chinese Han individuals. SNP genotype data were available for 980 Chinese glioma patients and 990 healthy controls. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between rs1920116 and glioma risk adjusted for age, gender and stratified by tumor grade where appropriate. The allele G at TERC rs1920116 are risk factors for gliomas, and its association with glioma risk was consistent across tumor subgroups in the Chinese Han population (OR = 1.18-1.21). In order to assess variation in SNP effect size at different patient ages, glioma cases and controls were divided into 3 age strata, in years: <50, 50-59, and 60+. The results of multiple logistic regression analyses indicate that the SNP has age-specific effects on the risk of developing glioma. Our report confirmed the effects of rs1920116 near TERC on glioma occurring in older peoples in the Chinese Han population for the first time. As TERC is a candidate for inter-individual variation in telomere length, our study supports the hypothesis that telomerase-related mechanisms of telomere maintenance are more associated with gliomas that develop later in life."
26018909,26018909,The association of adiponectin gene promoter variations with non-small cell lung cancer in a Han Chinese population.,"Recently, in vitro studies have demonstrated that adiponectin has antiangiogenic and tumor growth-limiting properties. Additionally, serum adiponectin levels have been associated with the risk of several cancers; specifically, serum adiponectin was significantly lower in lung cancer patients with advanced-stage disease. In this study, we examined the association of adiponectin gene promoter variations associated with adiponectin gene expression and plasma levels in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a Han Chinese population. A total of 319 patients with NSCLC and 489 healthy individuals were recruited to evaluate the association of four adiponectin gene promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (SNP-12140G>A, SNP-11426A>G, SNP-11391G>A and SNP-11377C>G) with NSCLS risk. Additionally, we constructed haplotypes of these four SNPs and evaluated the association of these haplotypes with NSCLS risk. Our results showed that among these four SNPs, only SNP-12140G>A was associated with NSCLC risk (P<0.05). The haplotype analysis showed that no haplotype was associated with NSCLC after performing a Bonferroni correction (P>0.05). Additionally, an association analysis of the four SNPs stratified into pathologic stages I+II and III+IV showed that these SNPs did not exhibit significant differences between pathologic stages I+II and III+IV. Moreover, we did not observe any differences in allele and genotype frequency for these SNPs between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Our results indicated that the G allele of SNP-12140 may be a risk factor for NSCLC (OR = 1.516; 95% CI: 1.098-2.094) in this Han Chinese population."

Here we aimed to investigate the potential association between SEPS1 variants and HT in the Han population. In addition, the effects of SEPS1 haplotypes on the susceptibility of the development of immune-mediated diseases with an inflammatory component will also be evaluated. Seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor allele frequency ⩾0.05 were genotyped in 1013 HT patients and 2998 healthy controls from genetically independent Han Chinese individuals. We identified that the rs28665122 SNP was significantly associated with HT, both in the female group (allelic P=0.002644 and genotypic P=0.010326) and the combined data set (allelic P=0.000518 and genotypic P=0.002731). Further analyses based on haplotypes indicated that a two-SNP haplotype (rs2009895-rs28665122) was significantly associated with HT (global P=0.0036), which was also observed in females (global P=0.0162) but not in males. Our findings provide further supporting evidence that confirms the results of previous studies, which suggested potential roles of the SEPS1 gene in the pathogenesis and etiology of HT."

26005883,26005883,Lack of association of TNFAIP3 and JAK1 with Behçet's disease in the European population.,"Behçet's disease (BD) is an immune-mediated and complex disease which has been associated with HLA class I molecules although other genes such as IL23R and IL10 have also been involved in the susceptibility to BD. Recently, an association of variants of the JAK1 and TNFAIP3 genes with the disease has been reported in the Chinese Han population. The aim of the present work was to asses whether the association described in Asian populations is replicated in Europeans."
26004291,26004291,C-reactive protein gene polymorphisms and gene-environment interactions in ischaemic stroke.,"Ischaemic stroke is a heterogeneous, multifactorial disease caused by the combination of certain risk factors and genetic factors. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of C-reactive protein (CRP) have been reported to be associated with serum CRP levels. However, genetic association studies have produced conflicting results regarding the association between these SNPs and ischaemic stroke. In this paper, we conducted a population-based case-control study to determine whether two SNPs of CRP (rs1800947 and rs3093059) are associated with ischaemic stroke in Chinese Han population and to evaluate their interaction with environmental risk factors. We found that the rs1800947 GC genotype is significantly associated with the risk of ischaemic stroke, particularly the small-vessel disease and its subtype. Crossover analysis revealed that patients with the rs1800947 GC genotype and habits of smoking or drinking were more susceptible to ischaemic stroke. No association was found between the rs3093059 and ischaemic stroke."
26000043,26000043,Complement receptor 1 genetic variants contribute to the susceptibility to gastric cancer in chinese population.,"As the receptor for C3b/C4b, type 1 complement receptor (CR1/CD35) plays an important role in the regulation of complement activity and is further involved in carcinogenesis. This study aimed to elucidate the association of CR1 genetic variants with the susceptibility to gastric cancer in Chinese population. Based on the NCBI database, totally 13 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected by Haploview program and genotyped using iPlex Gold Genotyping Assay and Sequenom MassArray among 500 gastric cancer cases and 500 healthy controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by logistic regression to evaluate the association of each SNP with gastric cancer. Of all selected Tag SNPs , CR1 rs9429942 T > C was found to confer to the risk of developing gastric cancer. Compared with the carriers with rs9429942 TT genotype, those with CT genotype had 88% decreased risk of developing gastric cancer with OR (95%CI) of 0.12 (0.03-0.50). Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) analysis revealed a significant three-way interaction among rs75422544 C > A, rs10494885 C > T and rs7525160 G > C in the development of gastric cancer with a maximum testing balance accuracy of 56.07% and a cross-validation consistency of 7/10 (P = 0.011). In conclusion, our findings demonstrated the genetic role of CR1 gene in the development of gastric cancer in Chinese population."
26004022,26004022,Association of the angiopoietin-like protein 8 rs2278426 polymorphism and several environmental factors with serum lipid levels.,"The present study was performed to examine the association of the angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8) rs2278426 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and several environmental factors with serum lipid profiles in the Mulao and Han populations. A total of 879 individuals of the Mulao ethnic group and 865 individuals of the Han Chinese ethnic group were included. The serum apolipoprotein (Apo) B level was higher, however the serum ApoA1 level was lower in the Mulao individuals than in the Han individuals (P<0.05 and P<0.001, respectively). The genotypic and allelic frequencies, and the association with the ANGPTL8 rs2278426 SNP were different between the Mulao and Han populations. The frequency of the A allele was 17.80% in Han individuals and 23.04% in Mulao individuals (P<0.001). The frequencies of GG, GA and AA genotypes were 68.79, 26.82 and 4.39% in the Han population, and 60.64, 32.65 and 6.71% in the Mulao population (P<0.005), respectively. A significant association between the SNP and serum lipid traits was only detected in Han females and not in Han males or in the Mulao population. The subjects with GA/AA genotypes had lower low‑density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‑C) and ApoB levels, and higher ApoA1 levels with a higher ApoA1/ApoB ratio than the subjects with the GG genotype in the Han population. Subgroup analyses revealed that the subjects with the GA/AA genotype had lower levels of total cholesterol, LDL‑C and ApoB, and a higher ApoA1/ApoB ratio than the subjects with the GG genotype in Han females (P<0.05‑P<0.001). Serum lipid parameters were also associated with several environmental factors, including dietary patterns, lifestyle, obesity, physical inactivity and hypertension, in the two ethnic groups (P<0.05‑0.001). These findings suggest that there may be an ethnic‑ and gender‑specific association of the rs2278426 SNP and serum lipid parameters."
26016498,26016498,Lack of Association between the TSPAN18 Gene and Schizophrenia Based on New Data from Han Chinese and a Meta-Analysis.,"Tetraspanin-18 (TSPAN18) potentially plays a role in the calcium signaling that is associated with dopamine-induced cortical neuron apoptosis and is considered to be an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (SCZ). Furthermore, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified TSPAN18 as a possible susceptibility gene for SCZ. To validate these findings and reveal the effects of different inheritance models, seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the TSPAN18 gene were analyzed in 443 patients with SCZ and 628 controls of Han Chinese descent via the SNPscan method. Single SNP, genotype, and association analyses with different models (i.e., additive, dominant, and recessive models) were performed, and the published datasets (2062 cases and 2053 controls) were combined with our results to determine the inheritance effects of the SNPs on SCZ. We observed genotypes and allele distributions of TSPAN18 gene did not show any significant associations in the Han Chinese population based on our experimental and meta-analytical results. Our findings indicate that the TSPAN18 gene is unlikely to be a major susceptibility gene for schizophrenia in Han Chinese."

25993436,25993436,Association of SNP Rs9943582 in APLNR with Left Ventricle Systolic Dysfunction in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease in a Chinese Han GeneID Population.,"Heart failure affects 1-2% of the adult population worldwide and coronary artery disease (CAD) is the underlying etiology of heart failure in 70% of the patients. The pathway of apelin and its apelin receptor (APJ) was implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure in animal models, but a similar role in humans is unknown. We studied a functional variant, rs9943582 (-154G/A), at the 5'-untranslated region, that was associated with decreased expression of the APJ receptor gene (APLNR) in a population consisting of 1,751 CAD cases and 1,022 controls. Variant rs9943582 was not associated with CAD, but among CAD patients, it showed significant association with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (431 CAD patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LV ejection fraction or LVEF< 40%) versus 1,046 CAD patients without LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF>50%) (P-adj = 6.71 × 10(-5), OR = 1.43, 95% CI, 1.20-1.70). Moreover, rs9943582 also showed significant association with quantitative echocardiographic parameters, including left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (effect size: increased 1.67 ± 0.43 mm per risk allele A, P = 1.15 × 10(-4)), left atrial size (effect size: increased 2.12 ± 0.61 mm per risk allele A, P = 9.56 × 10(-4)) and LVEF (effect size: decreased 2.59 ± 0.32 percent per risk allele A, P = 7.50 × 10(-15)). Our findings demonstrate that allele A of rs9943582 was significantly associated with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, the left atrial diameter and LVEF in the CAD population, which suggests an important role of the apelin/APJ system in the pathology of heart failure associated with ischemic heart disease."
25994644,25994644,Association of polymorphisms of A260G and A386G in DAZL gene with male infertility: a meta-analysis and systemic review.,"To investigate the association of single nucleotide polymorphism 260 and 386 (SNP260 and SNP386) gene with male infertility, an electronic search was performed to identify case-control studies evaluating the relationship of SNP260 or SNP386 of deleted in azoospermia-like (DAZL) and male infertility. Review Manager 5 was used to process the meta-analysis and other statistical analysis. A total of 139 records were retrieved, of which 13 case-control studies with total 2715 patients and 1835 normozoospermic men were included. SNP260 was found not to play a functional role in male oligo/azoospermia either for Caucasians or for Asians. But for SNP386, models of allele (A/G), dominant (AA/AG + GG), co-dominant (AA/AG) and super-dominant (AA + GG/AG) had a strong correlation to spermatogenic failure with related odds ratio being 0.15 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.07 to 0.34, P < 0.00001), 0.16 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.35, P < 0.00001), 0.15 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.33, P < 0.00001) and 0.15 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.33, P < 0.00001), respectively. Moreover, this correlation was only found in the Chinese Han population (decreasing around 85% risk of oligo/azoospermia infertility) and not found in India, Japan, and Caucasian countries. Our analysis demonstrated that SNP260 of DAZL did not contribute to oligo/azoospermia while SNP386 was correlated to male infertility. However, this correlation was only found in China with a country-specific and ethnicity-specific manner."
26005159,26005159,Gender-specific association between the cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein 4 rs4660293 single nucleotide polymorphism and serum lipid levels.,"Cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein 4 (PABPC4) is an RNA-processing protein which has an important role in regulating gene expression. The association of the PABPC4 rs4660293 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and serum lipid profiles has, to the best of our knowledge, not previously been studied in the Chinese population. The present study aimed to investigate the association between the PABPC4 rs4660293 SNP and several environmental factors with serum lipid levels in the Mulao and Han populations. A total of 727 individuals of Mulao nationality and 729 individuals of Han nationality were randomly selected from stratified randomized samples from a previous study by our group. Genotypes of the PABPC4 rs4660293 SNP were determined via polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses and subsequently confirmed by direct sequencing. Serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein (Apo) B were higher in the Mulao group than those in the Han group (P<0.01 for each). The genotypic and allelic frequencies of the PABPC4 rs4660293 SNP were significantly different between males and females in the Mulao population (P<0.05 for each), while no significant difference was detected between those of males and females amongst the Han population. The frequency of the G allele was higher in Mulao males than in Mulao females (22.12 vs. 13.44%). The G allele carriers were found to have higher total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and ApoAI levels in Han females but not in Han males, and lower TC and HDL-C levels in Mulao females but not in Mulao males than those of the G allele non-carriers (P<0.05 for all). These associations were confirmed by multiple linear regression analysis (P<0.05‑0.001). Serum lipid parameters were also correlated with multiple environmental factors (P<0.05‑0.001). The PABPC4 rs4660293 SNP was associated with serum TC, HDL-C, LDL-C and ApoAI levels in these study populations; however, the association varied between the Mulao and Han populations. A gender-specific association was identified in the populations of the two ethnic groups."
25990668,25990668,Association study of the miRNA-binding site polymorphisms of CDKN2A/B genes with gestational diabetes mellitus susceptibility.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a complex disease induced by a combination of genetic factors and environmental exposures. Growing evidence suggests that common single nucleotide polymorphisms within miRNA-binding sites (miR-binding SNPs) contribute to the development of various diseases. However, the roles of miR-binding SNPs in GDM have not been fully elucidated. The CDKN2A/B genes have been identified as two of the strongest genetic determinants for diabetes risk. The aim of the study was to first investigate the associations between miR-binding SNPs of CDKN2A/B, GDM susceptibility, and quantitative metabolism traits."

25966176,25966176,Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in dopamine receptor D1 are associated with heroin dependence but not impulsive behavior.,"Previous studies suggested that dopamine receptors may be associated with drug dependence and impulsive behavior. In this study, we examined whether dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1) is associated with heroin dependence and the impulsive behavior in patients with heroin dependence. The participants included 367 patients with heroin dependence and 372 healthy controls from a Chinese Han population. We examined the potential association between heroin dependence and 8 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs686, rs4867798, rs1799914, rs4532, rs5326, rs265981, rs10078714, rs10078866) of DRD1, and the associations between single single-nucleotide polymorphism, haplotypes, and impulsive behavior. Compared with the healthy controls, heroin dependence patients showed a significantly lower frequency of GG homozygotes of rs5326 (P = 0.027), significantly lower frequency of the G allele of rs5326 (P = 0.007, odds ratio = 0.718, 95% confidence interval = 0.565-0.913), and higher frequency of the rs265981 G allele (P = 0.0002, odds ratio = 1.711, 95% confidence interval = 1.281-2.287). Furthermore, strong linkage disequilibrium was observed in 2 blocks (D' > 0.9). However, no association was observed between haplotypes and heroin dependence in the 2 blocks. This genetic behavior correlation study showed that the 2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, rs5326 and rs265981, were not associated with the impulsive behavior in patients with heroin dependence. These findings indicate that DRD1 gene polymorphisms are related to heroin dependence in a Chinese Han population and may be informative for future genetic or biological studies on heroin dependence."

25965418,25965418,A functional single-nucleotide polymorphism in the ERCC1 gene alters the efficacy of narrowband ultraviolet B therapy in patients with active vitiligo in a Chinese population.,"T lymphocytes have been shown to cause the destruction of melanocytes in vitiligo pathogenesis. Narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB), as an effective therapeutic strategy in vitiligo, can lead to the formation of DNA photoproducts such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) in perilesional lymphocytes and thus induce skin immunosuppression. The repair of DNA photoproducts is performed mainly through the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. We hypothesized that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NER genes might influence the repair capacity of CPDs and thus contribute to variations in phototherapy efficiency."
25958346,25958346,Correlation of functional GRIN2A gene promoter polymorphisms with schizophrenia and serum D-serine levels.,"Schizophrenia is a severe, complex mental disorder. Abnormal glutamate neurotransmission mediated by decreased expression of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors (NMDArs) and its endogenous co-agonist d-serine (d-Ser) has been proposed as one of the hypotheses of the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. GRIN2A gene promoter polymorphism causes changes in the regulation of the expression of NMDAr subunit genes. Our study is aimed at evaluating a possible association between GRIN2A promoter GT polymorphisms and schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population in Shaanxi and the relationship between serum d-Ser levels and GRIN2A (GT)n in schizophrenia. Four hundred and twenty patients with schizophrenia and 410 healthy individuals were recruited in this study and GRIN2A (GT)n repeats as well as serum d-Ser levels were measured in all of the subjects. Nineteen alleles were found in (GT)n locus. The allele frequency of (GT)21, (GT)22 and (GT)23 in schizophrenic subjects was significantly lower compared with the mentally healthy controls, while the allele (GT)26 was significantly more frequent than in normal persons. Transcriptional activity of GRIN2A promoter was gradually suppressed with the increase in the length of the (GT)n repeats. d-Ser levels in the serum of the GRIN2A (GT)21 schizophrenic patients were significantly lower than those of the GRIN2A (GT)21 healthy control. A significant correlation between serum d-Ser levels and GRIN2A (GT)21 in schizophrenia was detected. GRIN2A (GT)21 may play a significant role in the etiology of schizophrenia among the Chinese Han population of Shaanxi."
25966116,25966116,Association between methionine synthase reductase A66G polymorphism and primary infertility in Chinese males.,"We examined the association between the methionine synthase reductase (MTRR A66G), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR C677T and A1298C), and methionine synthase (MS A2756G) genotypes and non-obstructive male infertility in a Chinese population. This case-control study included 162 infertile Chinese patients with azoospermia (N = 100) or oligoasthenozoospermia (N = 62) and 120 fertile men as controls. The polymorphisms MTRR A66G, MTHFR C677T, A1298C, and MS A2756G were identified by direct DNA sequencing and the results were statistically analyzed. We found no association between the incidence of any of these variants in azoospermia patients and control populations. The frequency of the MTRR66 polymorphic genotypes (AG, AG+GG) was significantly higher in the oligoasthenozoospermia group compared to the controls (P = 0.013, 0.012). Our findings revealed an association between the single-nucleotide polymorphism A66G in the MTRR gene and male infertility, particularly in oligoasthenozoospermia males, suggesting that this polymorphism is a genetic risk factor for male infertility in Chinese men."

25966232,25966232,Association between the rs189037 single nucleotide polymorphism in the ATM gene promoter and cognitive impairment.,"The aim of this study was to explore the existence of a relationship between the rs189037 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene and cognitive impairment in the elderly (aged 60 years and above). In a cohort, 505 residents of Suinung City were consecutively recruited and their cognitive function was measured using a 30-point Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The subjects were divided into cognitive impairment group and control group on the basis of MMSE scores. Presence of the rs189037 SNP variant was examined using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The prevalence rates of cognitive impairment were 32.7% in the whole sample. The genotype frequencies of the rs189037 polymorphism were 33.5% (CC), 50.7% (CT), and 15.8% (TT); the C and T allele frequencies were 58.8 and 41.2%, respectively. No significant differences in the frequency distributions of the CC, CT and TT genotypes were observed between cognitively impaired and control groups. We found that the rs189037 SNP was not directly correlated with cognitive impairment among the elderly Chinese Han population."

Smoothened (SMO) gene has been considered associating with HCC and HCC recurrence, but its association with HCC recurrence after OLT is not clear yet. In this study, we aim at evaluating the association between donor and recipient SMO gene polymorphisms and HCC recurrence after OLT. A total of 76 patients with HCC who had undergone OLT from July 2007 to August 2012 were included. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), SMO rs3824, located at the 3'UTR region, was genotyped and analyzed in both donor and recipient. We demonstrated that recipient rs3824 polymorphism was significantly associated with HCC recurrence following OLT. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, TNM stage (p = 0.001), recipient SMO rs3824 genotype (CG vs. CC/GG p = 0.001), and histologic grade (p = 0.019) were identified as independent risk factors of HCC recurrence. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly higher in the recipient CC/GG group than in the CG group (p = 0.003 and p = 0.011, respectively). Cox proportional hazards modeling revealed that TNM stage, recipient SMO rs3824 genotype, pre-OLT serum AFP level, and histologic grade were independent factors (p < 0.05) for patients' clinical outcomes. In conclusion, recipient SMO rs3824 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of HCC recurrence following OLT and has a potential clinical value for the prognosis of HCC patients treated with OLT."

We attempted to replicate the associations between the two SNP loci and the risk of HCC in a Korean population. The rs7574865 in STAT4 and rs9275319 in HLA-DQ were genotyped in a total of 3838 Korean subjects composed of 287 HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma patients, 671 chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB) patients, and 2880 population controls using TaqMan genotyping assay. Gene expression was measured by microarray. A logistic regression analysis revealed that rs7574865 in STAT4 and rs9275319 in HLA-DQ were associated with the risk of CHB (OR = 1.25, P = 0.0002 and OR = 1.57, P= 1.44 × 10(-10), respectively). However, these loci were no association with the risk of HBV-related HCC among CHB patients. In the gene expression analyses, although no significant differences in mRNA expression of nearby genes according to genotypes were detected, a significantly decreased mRNA expression in HCC subjects was observed in STAT4, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1. Although the genetic effects of two HCC susceptibility loci were not replicated, the two loci were found to exert susceptibility effects on the risk of CHB in a Korean population. In addition, the decreased mRNA expression of STAT4, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1 in HCC tissue might provide a clue to understanding their role in the progression to HCC."

25895914,25895914,CNTNAP2 Is Significantly Associated With Speech Sound Disorder in the Chinese Han Population.,"Speech sound disorder is the most common communication disorder. Some investigations support the possibility that the CNTNAP2 gene might be involved in the pathogenesis of speech-related diseases. To investigate single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CNTNAP2 gene, 300 unrelated speech sound disorder patients and 200 normal controls were included in the study. Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms were amplified and directly sequenced. Significant differences were found in the genotype (P = .0003) and allele (P = .0056) frequencies of rs2538976 between patients and controls. The excess frequency of the A allele in the patient group remained significant after Bonferroni correction (P = .0280). A significant haplotype association with rs2710102T/+rs17236239A/+2538976A/+2710117A (P = 4.10e-006) was identified. A neighboring single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs10608123, was found in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs2538976, and the genotypes exactly corresponded to each other. The authors propose that these CNTNAP2 variants increase the susceptibility to speech sound disorder. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs10608123 and rs2538976 may merge into one single-nucleotide polymorphism."

25904013,25904013,TNP1 Functional SNPs in bta-miR-532 and bta-miR-204 Target Sites Are Associated with Semen Quality Traits in Chinese Holstein Bulls.,"Transition nuclear proteins (TNPs), major proteins found in the chromatin of condensing spermatids, have been implicated in spermatogenesis and male fertility. In this study, DNA samples were collected from 404 Chinese Holstein bulls and sequenced to identify genetic variants in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of TNP1 and to investigate genetic variations in the TNP1 gene and their common haplotypes. This study was also conducted to determine whether these variations affect bovine semen quality traits and expression levels by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism, bioinformatics analyses, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), and fluorescence assay. Results showed that one new single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; g. 528 G>A, ss1388116558) and one reported SNP (g. 442 A>G, rs110469441) were found in the 3'-UTR of the TNP1 gene. Bioinformatics analysis results revealed that both loci were located in bta-miR-532-binding and bta-miR-204-binding regions, respectively. Association studies revealed that bulls with H1H1 (AGAG) and H1H3 (AGGG) haplotype combinations exhibited a lower deformity rate than those with other haplotype combinations (P < 0.05). The qPCR results showed that the relative mRNA expression of TNP1 in bulls with H1H1 haplotype combination was significantly higher than that in bulls with H4H4 haplotype combination (P < 0.05). MicroRNA qPCR results suggested that bta-miR-532 expression was downregulated by 5-fold in adult bull testicular tissues compared with that in fetal bull testicular tissues; by contrast, bta-miR-204 expression was downregulated by 1.6-fold. Luciferase assay results also indicated that TNP1 expression was directly targeted by bta-miR-532 and bta-miR-204 in murine Leydig tumor cell lines. These results provide the first indication of g. 442 A>G-mediated and g. 528 G>A-mediated translational suppression in which SNPs altered the binding of bta-miR-204 and bta-miR-532 to the 3'-UTR of TNP1; the mediated translational suppression could be involved in the regulation of TNP1 expression and may influence the morphological characteristics of Chinese Holstein bull sperm. We propose that SNPs on the TNP1 3'-UTR may help select semen quality trait in Chinese Holstein bulls in the dairy industry."
25894340,25894340,Polymorphisms in Genes of Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle Key Enzymes Are Associated with Early Recurrence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Alterations of activity and expression in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle key enzymes have been indicated in several malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). They play an important role in the progression of cancer. However, the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding these key enzymes on the recurrence of HCC has not been investigated. In this study, we genotyped 17 SNPs in genes encoding TCA cycle key enzymes and analyzed their association with recurrence-free survival (RFS) in a cohort of 492 Chinese HCC patients by Cox proportional hazard model and survival tree analysis. We identified 7 SNPs in SDHC, SDHD, FH, and IDH2 genes to be significantly associated with the RFS of HCC patients. Moreover, all these SNPs were associated with the early recurrence (within 2 years after surgery) risk of diseases. Cumulative effect analysis showed that these SNPs exhibited a dose-dependent effect on the overall and early recurrence. Further stratified analysis suggested that number of risk genotypes modified the protective effect on HCC recurrence conferred by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization treatment. Finally, the survival tree analysis revealed that SNP rs10789859 in SDHD gene was the primary factor contributing to HCC recurrence in our population. To the best of our knowledge, we for the first time observed the association between SNPs in genes encoding TCA cycle key enzymes and HCC recurrence risk. Further observational and functional studies are needed to validate our findings and generalize its clinical usage."
25932222,25932222,Polymorphisms of COL4A1 gene are associated with arterial pulse wave velocity in healthy Han Chinese and Uygur subjects.,"Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a noninvasive index of arterial stiffness and an independent predictor of cardiovascular outcomes. Type IV collagen is an important structural component of the vascular basement membrane, thus it is important for the integrity and functions of basement membrane. However, the relationship between genetic polymorphisms of COL4A1 gene and PWV in healthy Han Chinese and Uygur subjects remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the association between PWV and COL4A1 genetic polymorphisms in healthy Han Chinese and Uygur subjects. A total of 1533 subjects (909 Han, 624 Uygur) were selected from the Cardiovascular Risk Survey (CRS) study. Two SNPs (rs605143 and rs565470) were genotyped by using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length (PCR-RFLP) method. In the Uygur population, the two SNPs (rs605143 and rs565470) were associated with PWV by analyses of a recessive model (p = 0.002, p = 0.008, respectively), and the difference remained significant after multivariate adjustment (p = 0.004, p = 0.001, respectively); the AA genotype of rs605143 was associated with increased PWV value compared with the AG or GG genotype (1543.36 ± 324.79 cm/s vs. 1530.45 ± 314.24 cm/s and 1522.93 ± 316.00 cm/s); and the CC genotype of rs565470 was associated with increased PWV value compared with the CT or TT genotype (1647.90 ± 553.27 cm/s vs. 1506.8 ± 357.35 cm/s and 1488.4 ± 344.32 cm/s). But for healthy Han Chinese subjects, this association was not observed in rs605143 and rs565470 before and after multivariate adjustment. Both rs605143 and rs565470 in the COL4A1 gene are associated with PWV in healthy Uygur subjects, indicating that carriers of the A allele of rs605143 and the C allele of rs565470 have a high risk of Arterial stiffness."
25891929,25891929,A functional polymorphism of the microRNA-146a gene is associated with susceptibility to drug-resistant epilepsy and seizures frequency.,"Epilepsy is the third most common chronic brain disorder and is characterized by an enduring predisposition for seizures. Recently, a growing body of evidence has suggested that microRNA-146a (miR-146a) is upregulated in the brains of epilepsy patients and of mouse models; furthermore, miR-146a may be involved in the development and progression of seizures through the regulation of inflammation and immune responses. In this report, we performed a case-control study to analyze the relationship between the two potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the miR-146a gene (rs2910464 and rs57095329) and the risk of epilepsy in a Chinese population comprising 249 cases and 249 healthy controls."

Previous studies have indicated that AAM and AANM are highly heritable. RANKL/RANK/OPG signaling pathway is essential for mammary gland development, which is also found associated with post-menopausal and hormone-related diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate associations between the polymorphisms in the TNFSF11, TNFRSF11A and TNFRSF11B genes in the RANKL/RANK/OPG pathway with AAM and AANM in Chinese women."
25871515,25871515,Association between interleukin 17A polymorphisms and susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis in a Chinese population.,Previous studies have revealed an association between interleukin 17A (IL17A) polymorphisms and the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Japanese and Caucasian patients.

25875170,25875170,Association between the European GWAS-identified susceptibility locus at chromosome 4p16 and the risk of atrial septal defect: a case-control study in Southwest China and a meta-analysis.,"Atrial septal defect (ASD) is the third most frequent type of congenital heart anomaly, featuring shunting of blood between the two atria. Gene-environment interaction remains to be an acknowledged cause for ASD occurrence. A recent European genome-wide association study (GWAS) of congenital heart disease (CHD) identified 3 susceptibility SNPs at chromosome 4p16 associated with ASD: rs870142, rs16835979 and rs6824295. A Chinese-GWAS of CHD conducted in the corresponding period did not reveal the 3 susceptibility SNPs, but reported 2 different risk SNPs: rs2474937 and rs1531070. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the associations between the 3 European GWAS-identified susceptibility SNPs and ASD risk in the Han population in southwest China. Additionally, to increase the robustness of our current analysis, we conducted a meta-analysis combining published studies and our current case-control study. We performed association, linkage disequilibrium, and haplotype analysis among the 3 SNPs in 190 ASD cases and 225 age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. Genotype and allele frequencies among the 3 SNPs showed statistically significant differences between the cases and controls. Our study found that individuals carrying the allele T of rs870142, the allele A of rs16835979, and the allele T of rs6824295 had a respective 50.1% (odds ratio (OR) = 1.501, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.122-2.009, PFDR-BH = 0.018), 48.5% (OR = 1.485, 95%CI = 1.109-1.987, PFDR-BH = 0.012), and 38.6% (OR = 1.386, 95%CI = 1.042-1.844, PFDR-BH = 0.025) increased risk to develop ASD than wild-type allele carriers in our study cohort. In the haplotype analysis, we identified a disease-risk haplotype (TAT) (OR = 1.540, 95%CI = 1.030-2.380, PFDR-BH = 0.016). Our meta-analysis also showed that the investigated SNP was associated with ASD risk (combined OR (95%CI) = 1.35 (1.24-1.46), P < 0.00001). Our study provides compelling evidence to motivate better understanding of the etiology of ASD."

25867398,25867398,Associations between genetic variants and the severity of metabolic syndrome in subjects with type 2 diabetes.,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) includes obesity, dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, and dysglycemia. Subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) exhibit features of MetS. The etiology of MetS is complex, involving both environmental and genetic factors. In this study, we examined the role of specific candidate genetic variants on the severity of MetS in T2D subjects. A total of 240 T2D subjects aged 35-64 years were recruited. Waist circumstance, plasma triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting plasma glucose, and blood pressure were measured to define MetS. Subjects were divided into 4 groups according to MetS components. Target genes involved in fibrotic and inflammatory processes, insulin and diabetes, cell growth and proliferation, and hypertension were genotyped. A total of 13 genes and 103 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed to evaluate their genetic association with MetS severity in T2D subjects. Univariate ordinal logistic regression using a dominant model (homozygous for the major allele vs carriers of the minor allele) revealed 6 SNP markers within 4 genes with genotypes associated with MetS risk. For the SNP genotypes of rs362551 (SNAP25), rs3818569 (RXRG), rs1479355, rs1570070 (IGF2R), and rs916829 (ABCC8), heterozygotes showed a lower risk of MetS compared with the reference group. In addition, the CC genotype was comparable to the TT genotype for rs3777411. There was no gender-specific effect. In conclusion, our results suggest that among the Han Chinese population, several SNPs increase the risk of severe MetS in T2D subjects. Further study in a large population should be conducted."
25883525,25883525,Association of Dectin-1 and DC-SIGN gene single nucleotide polymorphisms with fungal keratitis in the northern Han Chinese population.,Dendritic cell-associated C-type lectin-1 (Dectin-1) and dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) play a crucial role in the early procedure of fungal pathogen defenses. The present study evaluated the associations between Dectin-1 and DC-SIGN gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and susceptibility to fungal keratitis (FK) in the northern Han Chinese population.
25867405,25867405,Effect of a pre-microRNA-149 (miR-149) genetic variation on the risk of ischemic stroke in a Chinese Han population.,"Clinical and experimental data have demonstrated that genetic factors play an important role in determining the susceptibility to ischemic stroke (IS). The present study was performed to clarify the association between the pre-microRNA-149 (miR-149) single nucleotide polymorphism rs71428439 and the risk of IS in the Jiangsu Han population. Polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism were performed to identify the genotypes of the miR-149 single-nucleotide polymorphism rs71428439 in 730 unrelated subjects (IS, 348; healthy controls, 382). Plasma levels of homocysteine were determined using a radioassay kit. Compared to healthy controls, IS patients had a lower frequency of GG genotype distribution of the hsa-mir-149 polymorphism (11.5 vs 16.0%) and a higher frequency of TT (46.6 vs 39.0%). The risk of IS was significantly lower among subjects carrying the GG genotype than subjects carrying the AA genotype (odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.603 (0.382- 0.952), P = 0.030) or at least carrying the G allele than patients carrying the A allele (odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.769 (0.620-0.954), P = 0.019). Levels of folate were statistically higher in patients with the TT genotype (8.59 ± 7.75 ng/mL) than in those with the CC genotype (6.32 ± 5.97 ng/mL) in IS patients. Our results suggest that the miR- 149 single nucleotide polymorphism rs71428439 influences plasma levels of homocysteine and is associated with IS risk in the Jiangsu Han population."
25865299,25865299,Association of miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism with cardio-cerebrovascular diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The microRNA146a rs2910164 polymorphism has been associated with the development of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases (CCDs); however, the results were inconsistent among different studies. The present report was aimed to investigate the association between rs2910164 G/C polymorphism and the risk of CCDs. Based on the data extracted from 12 eligible studies with a total of 5433 CCD cases and 6278 controls, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the diseases risk of rs2910164 G/C polymorphism under allelic contrast (C vs. G), homozygote comparisons (CC vs. GG), heterozygote comparisons (GC vs. GG), dominant model (CC+GC vs. GG) and recessive models (CC vs. GC+GG) in fixed or random effects models. We also conducted pathway enrichment analyses using the putative and validated miR-146a interacting targets to explore the functional impacts of rs2910164. The current meta-analysis results showed that rs2910164 CC genotype has a decreased risk with overall cardiovascular diseases and the specific coronary artery disease. Stratified analysis based on ethnicity showed that the CC genotype has a decreased risk with CCDs in Chinese population, but has an increased risk with CCDs in Korean and Indian populations. The results from pathway enrichment analysis also revealed the association of rs2910164 G allele with heart function and disease related pathways. Our findings suggested that miR-146a CC genotype might be a protective factor for cardiovascular diseases in Chinese population, but a risk factor in Korean and Indian populations."

25867326,25867326,Associations between INSR and MTOR polymorphisms in type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy in a Northeast Chinese Han population.,"We explored the associations of INSR and mTOR, 2 key genes in the insulin signaling pathway, and the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1799817, rs1051690, and rs2059806) in INSR and 3 SNPs (rs7211818, rs7212142, and rs9674559) in mTOR were genotyped using the Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX platform in 89 type 2 diabetes patients without diabetic nephropathy, 134 type 2 diabetes patients with diabetic nephropathy, and 120 healthy control subjects. Statistical analysis based on unconditional logistic regression was carried out to determine the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) for each SNP. Combination analyses between rs2059806 and rs7212142 were also performed using the X(2) test and logistic regression. Among these 6 SNPs, 4 (rs1799817, rs1051690, rs7211818, and rs9674559) showed no association with type 2 diabetes mellitus or diabetic nephropathy. However, rs2059806 in INSR was associated with both type 2 diabetes mellitus (P = 0.033) and type 2 diabetic nephropathy (P = 0.018). The rs7212142 polymorphism in mTOR was associated with type 2 diabetic nephropathy (P = 0.010, OR = 0.501, 95%CI = 0.288- 0.871), but showed no relationship with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Combination analysis revealed that rs2059806 and rs7212142 had a combined effect on susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. Our results suggest that both INSR and mTOR play a role in the predisposition of the Han Chinese population to type 2 diabetic nephropathy, but the genetic predisposition may show some differences."

We found that the CC genotype was more frequent in the osteosarcoma group compared to the control group (P = 0.011). We also found that the C allele was more common in osteosarcoma patients than that in control subjects (P = 0.004). Our results suggested that the RECQL5 genetic polymorphism was associated with osteosarcoma in a Chinese population."

The key effectors in the WNT signaling pathway are low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5), transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), and downstream-regulated glucagon (GCG). Our previous studies suggest that the WNT signaling pathway plays a significant role in risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Chinese population. The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LRP5, TCF7L2 and glucagon (GCG) and quantitative traits in a healthy population. We used tag SNP to screen candidate SNPs for LRP5 and GCG; for TCF7L2, used the confirmed SNP rs11196218. A total of 1842 patients with T2DM and 7777 healthy controls underwent genotyping for the SNPs. We found a significant association of rs3758644 in LRP5 and fasting plasma glucose (p=0.006), and rs11196218 in TCF7L2 and triglycerides level (p=0.004). Among the SNPs in LRP5, TCF7L2, and GCG analyzed, only rs3758644 of LRP5 and rs11196218 of TCF7L2 were significantly associated with fasting plasma glucose and triglycerides index, respectively, in a healthy population."

The mammalian target of the the rapamycin (MTOR) gene has been reported to be involved in mouse embryo development and regulates the proliferation of embryonic stem cells. Our study explored the relationship between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs17027478 in the promoter region of MTOR gene and the development of RSA. A total of 306 patients with RSA and 127 healthy females as the controls were recruited in the case-control study. The predesigned TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay was adopted to analyze the association between rs17027478 and the development of RSA. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and luciferase reporter assays were conducted to analyze the function of the variant. It was found that a significant association exists between the variant and the risk of RSA among the patients who experienced no less than three spontaneous abortions (p = 0.043). However, the significant difference disappeared among the total samples (p = 0.524). Furthermore, we observed lower MTOR mRNA levels in the blood of RSA patients compared with healthy females (p = 0.020). The luciferase reporter assay showed that the rs17027478A allele significantly reduced the luciferase activity (p = 0.029). The results demonstrated that the variant rs17027478 in the promoter region of MTOR might be a good candidate responsible for the pathogenesis of RSA.

25836258,25836258,Association between ankylosing spondylitis and the miR-146a and miR-499 polymorphisms.,"miRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of multiple target genes at the post-transcriptional level. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA sequences may alter miRNA expression and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple forms of arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis. The present study explored the association between ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), miR-146a rs2910164G>C and miR-499 rs3746444T>C, in a Han Chinese population. A case-control study consisting of 102 subjects with AS and 105 healthy controls was designed. The two miRNA SNPs were identified by direct sequencing. Subsequently, their gene and genotype frequencies were compared with healthy controls. A significant difference was observed in the miR-146a rs2910164G>C SNP. The frequency of the G allele was markedly higher in the AS patients than in the healthy controls (P = 0.005, Pc = 0.01, OR = 1.787), and the frequency of the GG genotype was higher in AS patients than in controls (P = 0.014, Pc = 0.042, OR = 2.516). However, no significant association was found between the miR-499 rs3746444T>C variant and susceptibility to AS. This is the first study to address the association between the miR-146a rs2910164G>C and miR-499 rs3746444T>C polymorphisms and AS, and it suggests a potential pathogenic factor for AS. Further studies are needed to validate our findings in a larger series, as well as in other ethnic backgrounds."
25855559,25855559,Pooled genetic analysis reveals an association of SNPs of only a few genes with risk predisposition to ischemic stroke in a Chinese population.,"Up to date, series of studies on ischemic stroke had resulted in inconsistent conclusion. In this study, we aimed to evaluate which specific genes were associated with increased predisposition to stroke in a Chinese population. To identify the specific genes and polymorphisms associated with predisposition to ischemic stroke, we performed high throughput sequenom based next-generation sequencing from 743 patient with history of ischemic stroke. Variants SNPs in nNOS, renalase, MTHFR, CELSR1 and XYLB genes were found significantly associated with IS, thus suggesting involvement of these loci to IS in Chinese patients. Because of different locations on chromosomes, haplotype analyses were not feasible. Our results demonstrate the top level genes that are related to normal vascular physiology, viz. genes of nitric oxide synthesis, endothelial health and smooth muscle biology. Further validation studies are awaited."
25857634,25857634,"Genetic Polymorphisms in the Toll-like Receptor 10, Interleukin (IL)17A and IL17F Genes Differently Affect the Risk for Tuberculosis in Croatian Population.","Proinflammatory conditions leading to activation of macrophages via interferon-γ bear an important role in host defence against intracellular bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt). Interleukin-17 plays a similar role, as it appears to be also an activator of macrophages. Recently, the TLR-10 was identified as an anti-inflammatory factor that exerts its action via association with the TLR-2 chain at the cell surface of macrophages, the latter being an Mt-binding protein. We have previously found that gene polymorphisms that either inactivate the TLR2 gene product or have a dominant-negative role are associated with tuberculosis (TB) in Croatian population. We have now extended our survey and found that single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in TLR10 (rs11096957) is associated with risk for TB. Homozygotes carrying the A allele are associated with predisposition to disease as analysed by the dominant model of inheritance. In contrast, SNPs in the proinflammatory IL17A and IL17F genes (rs2275913 and rs763780, respectively), found previously to correlate with the disease occurrence in Chinese population, were not significantly associated with tuberculosis in the Croatian population."
25818998,25818998,Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the microRNA miR-1596 locus with residual feed intake in chickens.,"MicroRNAs are an abundant class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. Genetic variations in microRNA sequences may be associated with phenotype differences by influencing the expression of microRNAs and/or their targets. This study identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genomic region of the microRNA miR-1596 locus of chicken. Of the two SNPs, one was 95 bp upstream of miR-1596 (g.5678784A>T) and the other was in the middle of the sequence producing the mature microRNA gga-miR-1596-3p (g.5678944A>G). Genotypic distribution of the two SNPs had large differences among 12 chicken breeds (lines), especially between the fast-growing commercial lines and the slow-growing Chinese indigenous breeds for the g.5678784A>T SNP. Only the g.5678784A>T SNP was significantly associated with residual feed intake (RFI) in the F2 population derived from a fast-growing and a slow-growing broiler as well as in the pure Huiyang bearded chicken. The birds with the AA genotype of the g.5678784A>T SNP had lower RFI and higher expression of the mature gga-miR-1596-3p microRNA of miR-1596 than did those with the other genotypes of the same SNP. We also found that the expression of the mature gga-miR-1596-3p microRNA of miR-1596 was significantly associated with RFI. These findings suggest that miR-1596 can become a candidate gene related to RFI, and its genetic variation may contribute to changes in RFI by altering expression levels of the mature gga-miR-1596-3p microRNA in chicken."
25810067,25810067,Association of gene polymorphisms in RANKL/RANK/OPG system with hypertension and blood pressure in Chinese women.,"Recent studies have revealed that the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand/RANK/osteoprotegerin (RANKL/RANK/OPG) system has an important role in vascular calcification, which is contributory to various cardiovascular diseases and intimately linked to the regulation of blood pressure. Therefore, we performed a case-control study to investigate the associations of 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TNFSF11, TNFRSF11A and TNFRSF11B genes in the RANKL/RANK/OPG system with hypertension and blood pressure in post-menopausal Chinese women. In this study, 503 hypertensive patients and 509 normal controls were recruited. Genotyping was performed using the high-throughput Sequenom genotyping platform. The results showed that two SNPs (rs6567270 and rs4603673) in the TNFRSF11A were associated with hypertension (P=0.010 and P=0.013, respectively) and systolic blood pressure (P=0.024 and P=0.023, respectively). One SNP (rs9646629) in the TNFRSF11A showed significant association with diastolic blood pressure (P=0.031). The results of this study suggest that TNFRSF11A but not TNFSF11 and TNFRSF11B genetic variation is associated with hypertension and blood pressure in Chinese women. The findings provide additional support for the genetic role of RANKL/RANK/OPG system in hypertension and blood pressure regulation."
25845619,25845619,Chemokine CX3CL1 and its receptor CX3CR1 are associated with human atherosclerotic lesion volnerability.,CX3CL1 and its receptor CX3CR1 have been emphasized in atherosclerosis recently.

25818163,25818163,The single nucleotide polymorphism Rs12817488 is associated with Parkinson's disease in the Chinese population.,"A recent meta-analysis of datasets from five of the published Parkinson's disease (PD) genome-wide association studies implicated the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12817488 in coiled-coil domain containing 62 (CCDC62)/huntingtin interacting protein 1 related (HIP1R) as a risk factor for PD. We conducted a case-control study to evaluate the possible association between rs12817488 and PD in Chinese people. All patients (515 PD patients and 518 age and sex-matched controls) were successfully genotyped using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. We observed that the rs12817488 polymorphism is associated with PD (p=0.003) and that the genotype and allele frequencies showed a difference between late-onset PD patients and male controls (p=0.025 and p=0.007, respectively). However, there was no difference in the early-onset PD patients and controls. We found a difference in the genotype and allele frequencies between the male PD patients and the male controls (p=0.034 and p=0.017, respectively). However, there was no difference in females. Patients with the A allele were susceptible to PD in both dominant (GA+AA versus GG; odds ratio [OR] 1.365, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.041-1.788) and recessive (AA versus GG+GA; OR 1.606, 95% CI 1.194-2.158) models. Therefore, our findings support the conclusion that the rs12817488 in CCDC62/HIP1R polymorphism may increase the risk of PD in the Chinese Han population."

25796175,25796175,CYP2J2 rs890293 polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease in the Chinese Han population.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive dysfunction and memory loss. Increasing evidence indicates that inflammation in the brain is a powerful factor in AD progression. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, the biologically active derivatives of arachidonic acid, synthesized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenases, have been proven to have powerful anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of this study was to examine whether polymorphism in CYP2J2, encoding one of the most common CYP epoxygenase isoforms, is associated with late-onset AD (LOAD). This case-control study genotyped 672 representatives of the Chinese Han population, including 321 LOAD patients and 351 healthy controls matched for age and gender, for the functional rs890293 polymorphism within CYP2J2 by means of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The CYP2J2 rs890293 T allele and GT+TT genotype were significantly associated with an increased risk of LOAD. Further data stratification according to the presence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele confirmed a strong association between CYP2J2 rs890293 and LOAD, and indicated that the involvement of CYP2J2 in LOAD was independent of ApoE-ϵ4. Our study demonstrated that CYP2J2 rs890293 is a possible predisposing genetic factor for progression of LOAD."
25808444,25808444,Rs4948496 within ARID5B gene is associated with clinical features of systemic lupus erythematosus in the Chinese Han population.,"In our previous meta-analysis of genome-wide association study, we identified the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4948496 (P = 5.1 × 10(-11) , odds ratio [OR] = 0.85) within the ARID5B gene associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a Chinese population. To investigate its association with disease subphenotypes, we further analyzed the genotype data of rs4948496 in 4348 cases and 6679 controls from our previous meta-analysis and an independent replication cohort in this study. The SNP rs4948496 was significantly associated with SLE (P = 1.61 × 10(-5) , OR = 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.83-0.93) in our group. In case-only study, the genotype of rs4948496 was associated with antinuclear antibodies (P = 0.03, OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.68-0.98) and anti-RNP (P = 0.03, OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.76-0.99). This study showed that rs4948496 in ARID5B is associated with several subphenotypes of SLE and this gene may cause the complicacy of clinical features."
25834816,25834816,A functional variant at miR-520a binding site in PIK3CA alters susceptibility to colorectal cancer in a Chinese Han population.,"An increasing body of evidence has indicated that polymorphisms in the miRNA binding site of target gene can alter the ability of miRNAs to bind their target genes and modulate the risk of cancer. We aimed to investigate the association between a miR-520a binding site polymorphism rs141178472 in the PIK3CA 3'-UTR and the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in a Chinese Han population. The polymorphism rs141178472 was analyzed in a case-control study, including 386 CRC patients and 394 age- and sex-matched controls; the relationship between the polymorphism and the risk of colorectal cancer was examined. Individuals carrying the rs141178472 CC genotype or C allele had an increased risk of developing CRC (CC versus TT, OR (95% CI): 1.716 (1.084-2.716), P = 0.022; C versus T, OR (95% CI): 1.258 (1.021-1.551), P = 0.033). Furthermore, the expression of PIK3CA was detected in the peripheral blood mononucleated cell of CRC patients, suggesting that mRNA levels of PIK3CA might be associated with SNP rs141178472. These findings provide evidence that a miR-520a binding site polymorphism rs141178472 in the PIK3CA 3'-UTR may play a role in the etiology of CRC."
25800439,25800439,Genetic insight into the role of MRAS in coronary artery disease risk.,"The muscle Ras (MRAS) gene polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in white Europeans. The aim of this study was to ascertain the role of MRAS gene polymorphisms in conferring susceptibility to CAD, and to explore the effect on severity of CAD in Chinese population. We genotyped 5009 Chinese individuals (2466 CAD cases and 2543 controls) for eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) around MRAS and used logistic regression analysis to determine whether they were associated with CAD. The association of the SNP loci on the severity of CAD was analyzed using a logistic and linear regression analysis, respectively. Our results revealed that an intron SNP, rs1199337, tends to be marginally associated with CAD as previously reported in Caucasians (nominal P=0.01, OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.20). However, this association did not retain statistically significant levels after applying Bonferroni's correction for multiple testing (corrected P=0.08). There was no significant association between other loci and CAD (nominal P>0.05). We did not observe any significant association between the SNPs and severity of CAD (all P values>0.05). From the above results, the MRAS gene loci might have a minor effect in conferring susceptibility to CAD in Chinese population."
25785145,25785145,Genetic polymorphisms of interleukin-16 are associated with susceptibility to primary knee osteoarthritis.,"Interleukin-16 (IL-16) polymorphisms have been associated with various disease states, and its activity is dysregulated in synovial fibroblasts of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. Here, the association between genetic polymorphisms in the gene encoding IL-16 and susceptibility to primary knee osteoarthritis was investigated in the Chinese Han population. The study included 228 unrelated patients, half of whom presented with primary knee osteoarthritis (OA); the remainder was healthy individuals. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used to examine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL16 in these patients. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square goodness-of-fit test, Hardy-Weinberg (H-W) equilibrium, linkage disequilibrium analysis, and logistic regression analysis. The genotype distributions of three IL16 SNPs, rs11556218, rs4778889, and rs4072111, were found to be in line with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium criteria (P > 0.05). The single-factor logistic regression analysis showed that, compared with the T/T genotype, the T/G genotype decreased the risk of primary knee OA in rs11556218 (OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.18~0.82) and, compared with the C/C genotype, the C/T genotype increased the risk of primary knee OA in rs4072111 (OR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.07~3.59). There was linkage disequilibrium between rs4778889 and rs11556218 (D= 0.592, r(2) = 0.213). Finally, logistic regression analysis showed that compared to haplotype TTC, the TTT haplotype was associated with an increased risk of primary knee OA (OR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.09-4.98); however, the GCC haplotype was associated with a reduced risk of primary knee OA (OR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.12-0.93). Thus, the genetic polymorphisms rs11556218, rs4778889, and rs4072111 in the gene encoding IL-16 are associated with primary knee OA in Chinese Han population."

25785111,25785111,Single nucleotide polymorphisms of cathepsin S and the risks of asthma attack induced by acaroid mites.,"To investigate association between the three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, rs146456111, rs143154304 and rs147260142) in cathepsin S (Cat S) and the risks of allergic asthma attack induced by the acaroid mites in the Chinese population. A case-control study was performed in 412 cases and 454 volunteers/controls to evaluate the effects of three SNPs in Cat S on the risks of asthma attack. The genotypes were determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cleaved amplification polymorphism sequence-tagged sites (PCR-RFLP). The frequencies of genotypes and alleles in these SNPs in the asthmatic group were also analyzed between the two groups. The locus of rs146456111 in Cat S gene, the allele frequency of A and C in asthmatic group were significantly different from the control group (χ(2) = 184.425, P = 0.000), and the difference was significant regarding the distribution of the genotypes (AA, AC, and CC) between asthmatic subjects and normal controls (χ(2) = 177.915, P = 0.000). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the AC, CC, and AC + CC genotypes were significantly increased with the risk of asthma (AC vs. AA, OR = 4.013, 95% CI = 2.989-4.751, P = 0.000; CC vs. AA, OR = 3.167, 95% CI = 2.483-3.785, P = 0.000; AC + CC vs. AA, OR = 3.418, 95% CI = 2.381-4.214, P = 0.000, respectively), compared with AA genotype. Moreover, by comparison with allele A, allele C (OR = 2.187, 95% CI = 1.743-2.281, P < 0.001) tended to increase the risk of asthma; For the locus of rs143154304, compared with the allele frequency G with A in control group, there was no difference (χ(2) = 1.434, P = 0.231) in that of asthmatic group, as well as the distributions of the genotypes (AA, AG, and GG) between asthmatic subjects and normal controls (χ(2) = 1.997, P = 0.369); Logistic regression analysis showed that the AG, GG, and AG + GG genotypes were no risk to asthma (AG vs. AA, OR = 0.991, 95% CI = 0.625-1.507, P = 0.968; GG vs. AA, OR = 0.812, 95% CI = 0.525-1.258, P = 0.352; AG + GG vs. AA, OR = 0.914, 95% CI = 0.612-1.366, P = 0.660, respectively) as compared with AA genotype. By comparison with allele A, G allele (OR = 0.888, 95% CI: 0.732-1.078, P = 0.231) failed to increase the risk of asthma; The allele frequencies A and G of rs147260142 in asthma group and control group showed no significant difference (χ(2) = 0.162, P = 0.688), yet the distribution of the genotypes (AA, AG, and GG) in control group was different from that in asthmatic subjects (χ(2) = 7.520, P = 0.023); Logistic regression analysis suggested that, in compassion with AA genotype, the AG, and AG + GG genotypes appeared to increases the risk of asthma (AG vs. AA, OR = 0.630, 95% CI = 0.439-0.903, P = 0.012; AG + GG vs. AA, OR = 0.710, 95% CI = 0.507-0.996, P = 0.047); However, the GG genotype (OR = 0.843, 95% CI = 0.576-1.234, P = 0.286) and the allele G (OR = 1.040, 95% CI = 0.860-1.258, P = 0.688) were not related to the risk of asthma. The SNP of rs146456111A/C may be susceptible to the risks of asthma in the Chinese population; however, The SNPs of rs143154304A/G and rs147260142A/G may be less likely associated with the asthma attack."
25757091,25757091,"Association of GDF5, SMAD3 and RUNX2 polymorphisms with temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis in female Han Chinese.","Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA) is a complex disease and has a strong genetic component in its pathogenesis. Experimental evidence suggests the involvement of biological pathway in the disease. This case-control study was designed to investigate whether five common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GDF5, SMAD3, RUNX2, TGFβ1 and CHST11, respectively, are associated with TMJOA in female Han Chinese patients. A total of 240 participants were evaluated comprising 114 female patients diagnosed with TMJOA based on Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders and 126 healthy female controls. The SNPs of the five genes in the genomic DNA were examined by sequencing, and their allelic, genotypic and carriage rate frequency distributions, as well as the triple combination of the risk genotypes, were analysed using the logistic regression model. The SNP in GDF5 or SMAD3 showed significant association with TMJOA, a relatively weak association was observed in RUNX2. In the triple combinational analysis, the risk of TMJOA grew 5·09 times in the patients with five or six risk alleles (P < 0·01). This is the first study to evaluate the association of GDF5, SMAD3, RUNX2, TGFβ1 and CHST11 with TMJOA in female Han Chinese. Our study suggests that the SNPs of genes related to TGFβ family might contribute to the risk of TMJOA."
25773791,25773791,Rs895819 within miR-27a might be involved in development of non small cell lung cancer in the Chinese Han population.,"MicroRNA-27a (miR-27a) is deemed to be an oncogene that plays an important role in development of various cancers, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of miR-27a can influence the maturation or aberrant expression of hsa-miR27a, resulting in increased risk of cancer and poor prognosis for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to assess the effects of rs895819 within miR-27a on susceptibility and prognosis of NSCLC patients in 560 clinical confirmed cases and 568 healthy check-up individuals. Adjusted odds/hazard ratios (ORs/HRs) and 95% confidential intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the association between rs895819 and the risk and prognosis of NSCLC. The results showed that allele A and genotype GG of rs895819 were significantly associated with an increased risk of NSCLC (38.9% vs 30.8%, adjusted OR=1.26, 95%CI=1.23-1.29 for allele G vs A; 18.1% vs 11.7%, adjusted OR=1.67, 95%CI=1.59-1.75 for genotype GG vs AA). Moreover, positive associations were also observed in dominant and recessive models (53.7% vs 49.9%, adjusted OR=1.17, 95%CI=1.13-1.20 for GG/AG vs AA; 18.1% vs 11.7%, adjusted=1.65, 95%CI=1.58-1.73). However, no significant association was found between rs895819 and the prognosis of NSCLC in genotype, dominant and recessive models. These results suggested that miR-27a might be involved in NSCLC carcinogenesis, but not in progression of NSCLC. The allele G, genotype GG and allele G carrier (GG/AG vs AA) of rs895819 might be genetic susceptible factors for NSCLC. Further multi-central, large sample size and well-designed prospective studies as well as functional studies are warranted to verify our findings."

25765001,25765001,Association of FPGS genetic polymorphisms with primary retroperitoneal liposarcoma.,"Primary retroperitoneal liposarcoma is generally regarded as a genetic disorder. We have retrospectively genotyped 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 6 candidate genes (MDM2, CDK4, CDC27, FPGS, IGFN1, and PRAMEF13) in 138 patients and 131 healthy control subjects to evaluate the effects of genetic factors on individual susceptibility to primary retroperitoneal liposarcoma in Chinese population. Three SNPs (rs2870820, rs1695147, rs3730536) of MDM2 showed significant differences in single-loci genotypes and allele frequencies between case and control groups (p < 0.05). The minor allele G of SNP rs10760502 in FPGS (folylpolyglutamate synthase) gene was significantly associated with increased risk for primary retroperitoneal liposarcoma, compared with major allele A. Our data suggest that FPGS variant in Chinese population may affect individual susceptibility to primary retroperitoneal liposarcoma."
25749274,25749274,Joint effect of CENTD2 and KCNQ1 polymorphisms on the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus among Chinese Han population.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in populations of European ancestry have identified nine single nuclear polymorphisms (SNP) on chromosome 11 related to type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility. Herein, we further evaluate the association of these SNPs and T2D in a Chinese Han population. We performed a case-control study of 2925 T2D cases and 3281 controls to evaluate the association of five SNPs of KCNJ11, MTNR1B, CENTD2 and LOC387761 and T2D in addition to the previously reported four SNPs of KCNQ1. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate SNP's effect by adjustment for confounding factor age, sex and BMI. In the first stage, SNPs rs1552224 at CENTD2 were significantly associated with T2D and the association was statistically significant in the whole study population (P = 0.001) although it was not replicated in the second stage. rs1552224 and rs2237897 of KCNQ1 showed significant joint effect on T2D and there was a significant decreased risk of T2D with the number increase of risk alleles (P for trend = 3.81 × 10(-17)). Compared to those without carrying any risk allele, individuals carrying one, two, and three or four risk alleles had a 30.7%, 44.8% and 62.0% decreased risk for developing T2D, respectively. Our finding suggests that genetic variant rs1552224 of CENTD2 on chromosome 11 contributes to an independent effect as well as joint cumulative effect with rs2237897 of KCNQ1 on the risk of T2D in Chinese Han population, and further functional research would be warranted."

The generation of HCV F protein and PD-1 expression on T cells was determined. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed no association of rs12979860 CC genotype with spontaneous clearance of HCV infection in our subjects. The generation of HCV F protein was significantly related to HCV infection chronicity, but no significant relationship was found between HCV F protein and SNPs in PD-1. The rs10204525 TT genotype was associated with an increased risk of HCV infection chronicity in age ⩽56years subgroup (adjusted OR=0.390, P=3.8×10(-4)). The C allele of rs10204525 played protective roles in females infected with HCV (adjusted OR=0.608, P=0.008). A significant higher percentage of PD-1 expression on T cells was observed in rs10204525 TT genotype when compared to CC genotype (P=0.047). Moreover, a significant genotype-genotype interaction between IL-28B rs12979860 CC and PD-1 rs10204525 TC+CC was found to be associated with higher rates of spontaneous clearance (adjusted OR=0.689, P=0.032). The combined effect of rs12979860 and rs10204525 was of great value in predicting the outcomes of HCV infection. These analyses showed the importance of IL-28B and PD-1 polymorphisms and their interactions in the outcomes of HCV infection in Chinese Han population in Southeast China."

25738283,25738283,Association of genetic polymorphisms in the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene with prostate cancer aggressiveness.,"Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), encoded by the TERT gene, is an essential component of telomerase, essential for the maintenance of telomere DNA length, chromosomal stability and cellular immortality. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between common genetic variations across the TERT gene region and prostate cancer (PCa) aggressiveness in a Chinese population. A total of 12 TERT tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped on the Sequenom Mass-ARRAY iPLEX® platform in a case-case study with 1,210 Chinese patients with PCa. Unconditional logistic regression was used to investigate the association of genotypes with PCa aggressiveness, Gleason grade and risk of developing early-onset PCa. It was observed that the C allele of the TERT intron 2 SNP (rs2736100) was significantly associated with reduced risk of PCa aggressiveness [odds ratio (OR)=0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66-0.99; P=0.037]. This allele was also significantly correlated with a reduced risk of developing a tumor with a high Gleason score (>7; OR=0.83; 95% CI: 0.70-0.99; P=0.039). The T allele of the intron 4 SNP (rs10069690) was found to be significantly associated with a decreased risk for an aggressive form of PCa (OR=0.76; 95% CI: 0.59-0.97; P=0.030). In addition, the A allele of rs10078761 located at the 3' end of the TERT gene exhibited a statistically significant association with the reduced risk of developing a higher grade disease (OR=0.48; 95% CI: 0.28-0.81; P=0.006). However, no association between TERT polymorphisms and age at diagnosis was observed in the present study. The present findings demonstrated for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that genetic variations across the TERT gene are associated with PCa aggressiveness in a Chinese Han population."

25747431,25747431,No association of TP53 codon 72 SNP with male infertility: a study in a Chinese population and a meta-analysis.,"Genetic polymorphisms may affect human male fertility. Even though TP53 plays a role in spermatogenesis we know little about the association of the functional polymorphism at codon 72 of TP53 with respect to susceptibility to male infertility. We conducted a case-control study to investigate this association in a Chinese population and performed a meta-analysis in different populations to clarify this association. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of TP53 codon 72 (rs1042522 G>C) was genotyped by PCR-RFLP in 83 Chinese male infertility patients and 401 healthy controls. Meta-analysis was performed using the data from four currently available studies. The data from our study were overlayed using the v.9.0 STATA software package. We observed no association between the TP53 codon 72 polymorphism and male infertility (p = 0.84, OR = 1.04, 95% CI, 0.74-1.45). Meta-analysis confirmed the case-control result that there was no significant association between the codon 72 polymorphism of TP53 and male infertility (Pro vs. Arg; p = 0.31, OR = 0.86, 95% CI, 0.65-1.15; Pro/Pro vs. Arg-carriers; p = 0.65, OR = 0.91, 95% CI, 0.61-1.36; Pro-carriers vs. Arg/Arg: p = 0.15, OR = 0.75, 95% CI, 0.51-1.11). The data presented in this communication supports the view that the codon 72 polymorphism of TP53 may not contribute to male infertility susceptibility in the Chinese population."
25711478,25711478,Association of GWAS-Supported Variants rs2200733 and rs6843082 on Chromosome 4q25 with Ischemic Stroke in the Southern Chinese Han Population.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 4q25, rs2200733, and rs6843082, associated with ischemic stroke (IS) in Caucasians. However, subsequent validation studies have remained controversial. The current study aims to evaluate the associations between rs2200733, rs6843082, and IS in the southern Chinese Han population. A total of 1632 subjects were recruited in this case-control study. Genotyping for rs2200733 and rs6843082 was conducted in the Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX platform. The genetic association of the rs2200733 and rs6843082 polymorphisms with IS was estimated using the PLINK program. Our results show that the SNP rs2200733 and rs6843082 have no significant associations with IS in additive, dominant, recessive, and allelic models (all p > 0.050). However, the results also indicate that the rs2200733 polymorphism is associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) in IS patients in both the additive model (p adj  = 0.002) and the recessive model (p adj  = 0.002) after correcting for age. Meanwhile, the rs6843082 polymorphism showed a significant association with serum total cholesterol (TC) in IS individuals in the additive model (p adj  = 0.017) and the dominant model (p adj  = 0.023). These findings suggest that the SNP rs2200733 and rs6843082 on chromosome 4q25 may be not associated with IS susceptibility in southern Han Chinese. As for IS-related quantitative traits, the rs2200733 and rs6843082 polymorphisms might influence SBP and TC in IS patients, respectively."
25711310,25711310,Four genetic variants interact to confer susceptibility to atopic dermatitis in Chinese Han population.,"Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease and is affected by environmental and genetic factors. Gene-gene/environment interactions are strongly believed to contribute to the genetic risk of common diseases. A number of gene-environment interactions of atopic dermatitis were performed. However, there are few comprehensive investigations on the gene-gene (or genetic variants) interactions for atopic dermatitis. We explored the association model of 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which were most significant (P < 10E-05) in our previous genome wide association study (GWAS) for atopic dermatitis, and search for the possible genetic variant interactions based on the previous GWAS data using Generalized Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction and Plink 1.07 in the combined sample of 4,636 cases and 13,559 controls. The most significant associated evidence was observed under dominant model for SNPs rs3126085, rs12085366, and rs7701890, recessive model for SNP rs17173197, and additive model for SNPs rs2393903 and rs6010620. Three significant pair-way interactions were observed, including PRKAG2 and FLG SNPs (rs17173197 × rs3126085, P combined = 1.11E-15), PRKAG2 and TMEM232-SLC25A46 SNPs (rs17173197 × rs7701890, P combined = 2.22E-15), PRKAG2 and TNFRSF6B-ZGPAT SNPs (rs17173197 × rs6010620, P combined = 6.66E-16). Besides, a three-way significant interaction among PRKAG2, TMEM232-SLC25A46 and TNFRSF6B-ZGPAT SNPs (rs17173197 × rs7701890 × rs6010620, P combined = 5.99E-15) was observed in this study. These four genetic variant interactions confer susceptibility to atopic dermatitis, and highlight the genetic variant interactions in the etiology of atopic dermatitis in Chinese Han population."

It is unclear whether these observations can apply to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in China. An association study was performed on 395 SLE patients and 378 healthy controls recruited from the Chinese population, in which the IL12RB2 rs3790567, IKZF1 rs2366293, XKR6 rs4240671, TMEM39A rs1132200 and CSK rs34933034 polymorphisms were examined by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry. The frequency of the A allele of IL12RB2 rs3790567 was lower in the cases compared with the controls (24.8% vs 30.2%, P = 0.018) and significant difference among the AA, AG and GG genotypes of rs3790567 was detected between the SLE patients and healthy controls (P = 0.020). We also found a statistically significant difference in the dominant model (GG+AG vs AA, P = 0.008). There was no correlation between the genotypes and specific sub-phenotypes in the current cohort. Associations with IKZF1 rs2366293, XKR6 rs4240671, TMEM39A rs1132200 and CSK rs34933034 were also lacking (P > 0.05). The results supported the theory that IL12RB2 is associated with SLE in the Chinese population."
25772133,25772133,Haplotype combination of the bovine CFL2 gene sequence variants and association with growth traits in Qinchuan cattle.,"The aim of this study was to examine the association of cofilin2 (CFL2) gene polymorphisms with growth traits in Chinese Qinchuan cattle. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the bovine CFL2 gene using DNA sequencing and (forced) PCR-RFLP methods. These polymorphisms included a missense mutation (NC_007319.5: g. C 2213 G) in exon 4, one synonymous mutation (NC_007319.5: g. T 1694 A) in exon 4, and a mutation (NC_007319.5: g. G 1500 A) in intron 2, respectively. In addition, we evaluated the haplotype frequency and linkage disequilibrium coefficient of three sequence variants in 488 individuals in QC cattle. All the three SNPs in QC cattle belonged to an intermediate level of genetic diversity (0.25<PIC<0.5). Haplotype analysis of three SNPs showed that 8 different haplotypes were identified in all, but only 5 haplotypes were listed except for those with a frequency of <0.03. Hap4 (-GTC-) had the highest haplotype frequencies (34.70%). However in the three SNPs there were no significant associations between the 13 combined genotypes of the CFL2 gene and growth traits. LD analysis showed that the SNP T 1694 A and C 2213 G loci had a strong linkage (r(2)>0.33). Association analysis indicated that SNP G 1500 A, T 1694 A and C 2213 G were significantly associated with growth traits in the QC population. The results of our study suggest that the CFL2 gene may be a strong candidate gene that affects growth traits in the QC cattle breeding program."

The initial Shanghai cohort consisted of 712 unrelated patients with GD and 705 healthy control subjects, and the replication cohort from Xiamen Island included 433 patients with GD and 410 healthy control subjects. The serum concentration of IL-23 in GD patients was measured significantly higher than in health controls. Moreover in the subgroup analysis, higher concentrations of IL-23 were identified in patients of older age (⩾40 years) and female gender. We also performed an association study with the IL-23 gene polymorphism rs11171806 in both cohorts, in Shanghai cohorts, the frequencies of rs11171806 alleles were strongly different between Graves' disease patients (G 95.7% and A 4.3%) and healthy controls (G 97.7% and A 2.3%) (P=2.6×10(-3), OR=1.93 (95% CI: 1.25-2.97)), and in Xiamen cohorts, the proportion of individuals carrying the A allele of rs11171806 was the same significantly higher in Graves' disease patients than in controls [Graves' disease vs. control, 4.8% vs. 4.3%, OR=2.15 (95% CI: 1.23-3.79), P(allele)=6.3×10(-3)]. The distribution of rs11171806 genotype was also investigated in subgroups according to the age and gender. All of these findings suggested that IL-23 may play an important role in the development of GD, and the IL-23A gene is a genetic risk marker for GD in Han Chinese population."

Based on previous studies that the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of rs2230926 was association with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) of Japanese, Caucasian population and the northern Chinese Han population, we tested the alleles and geno-type frequencies of rs2230926 in TNFAIP3 to investigate whether rs2230926 is susceptible to RA of southern Chinese Han population. In our case-control association study, 207 RA patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1987 criteria were compared with 199 unrelated healthy subjects. After testing the alleles and genotype frequencies of rs2230926, the airwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) was computed and odd ration (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were used for evaluating the susceptibility to RA. The SNP of rs2230926 of the cases and control subjects were conformed to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P = 0.02257). The significantly statistical differences in alleles of T, G were founded in the cases and controls (P = 0.0027, OR 0.417, 95% CI 0.232-0.749); the genetic types of rs2230926 were associated with a susceptibility to RA, with OR 0.375 (95% CI 0.198-0.707, P = 0.0018).

25665737,25665737,Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the 3'UTR of ERAP1 gene with essential hypertension in the Northeastern Han Chinese.,"Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) may be involved in blood pressure regulation by inactivation of angiotensin II and generation of bradykinin. Our previous study with cDNA microarray indicated that the expression of ERAP1 is down-regulated in essential hypertension (EH) patients. Since the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) is known to play an important role in the post-transcriptional regulation by influencing the stability and translation process of mRNA, the present study aims to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 3'UTR of ERAP1 gene in a case-control study among the Northeastern Han Chinese through PCR-sequencing, and analyze the association with EH. Our results further verified the lower expression level of ERAP1 in the peripheral blood cells in patients with EH (917.12±517.57 vs. 1506.59±1214.09pg/mL, P=0.011). Four SNPs, 3'UTR-761G>A, 3'UTR-787C>T, 3'UTR-1008A>C and 3'UTR-1055A>G, were identified in the 3'UTR of ERAP1. 3'UTR-1008A>C and 3'UTR-1055A>G were in almost complete linkage disequilibrium. Association analysis showed that the genotypic and allelic frequencies of 3'UTR-1008A>C and 3'UTR-1055A>G were significantly different between EH and the control groups. Logistic regression and haplotypic analysis indicated that alleles of E20-1037C and E20-1084G as well as haplotype of C-G were the risk factors of EH (P<0.05). Subgroup analysis performed by age suggested that the frequencies of genotype and allele of 3'UTR-1008A>C and 3'UTR-1055A>G as well as the haplotypes C-G and A-A were significantly different between EH and the control in the younger group (<50), but not in the older group (≥50). Younger population with the 3'UTR-1008CC and/or 3'UTR-1055GG genotypes also tended to have higher blood pressure, especially the diastolic blood pressure. In conclusion, the 3'UTR-1008A>C and 3'UTR-1055A>G polymorphisms of ERAP1 gene were associated with EH, especially in the younger population, and the haplotype C-G could be the independent marker of EH."

The aim of this study is to confirm the association of cerebral infarction and 9p21.3 in a Chinese Han population. This is a hospital-based case-control study, which involves 769 patients and 682 healthy controls. Eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with cerebral infarction in previous literatures were genotyped and analyzed. The association analyses were performed at both SNP and haplotype levels. Three (rs2383207, rs1537378, and rs3731245) of eight SNPs were associated with cerebral infarction. In an allelic association analysis, rs2383207, rs3731245, and rs1537378 were significantly associated with CI; the odd ratios were 1.18 (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.01-1.37, P = 0.04), 1.29 (95 % CI = 1.06-1.56, P = 0.01), and 1.30 (95 % CI = 1.05-1.60, P = 0.02), respectively. rs1537378 remains significantly associated with CI independent of traditional cerebrovascular risk factors in a recessive model (odds ratio (OR) = 1.35, 95 % CI = 1.06-1.71, P = 0.013, Q = 0.03) and in an additive model (OR = 1.38, 95 % CI = 1.11-1.71, P = 0.004, Q = 0.02); conversely, rs2383207 (OR = 1.28, 95 % CI = 1.03-1.59, P = 0.02, Q = 0.03) and rs3731245 (OR = 1.31, 95 % CI = 1.05-1.65, P = 0.02, Q = 0.03) were significantly different in a recessive model. Haplotype analysis showed that the protective effect for haplotype AATAA remained significant (OR = 0.87, 95 % CI = 0.73-1.00, P = 2.99 × 10(3), Q = 2.15 × 10(3)).

25656805,25656805,Genetic association of ACSM1 variation with schizophrenia and major depressive disorder in the Han Chinese population.,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are two of the most common and severe mental disorders, the etiologies of which are not yet clearly elucidated. The ACSM1 gene has been identified as a susceptibility gene for SCZ in two previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS). ACSM1 catalyzes the activation of fatty acids and plays an important role in the metabolic system. Some evidence has suggested that ACSM1 contributes to a genetic risk for MDD. The present study aimed to evaluate the common genetic risk of the ACSM1 gene in these two disorders in the Han Chinese population. In total, 1235 patients with SCZ, 1045 patients with MDD and 1235 control subjects of Chinese origin were recruited. Six single nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) in ACSM1 were genotyped to test their associations with SCZ and MDD. SNP rs163234 was found to be significantly associated with both SCZ (permutated Pallele=1.700×10(-3), OR=1.350 [95% CI=1.152-1.581]) and MDD (permutated Pallele=4.800×10(-3), OR=1.329 [95% CI=1.127-1.567]). SNP rs433598 showed a strong association with SCZ (permutated Pallele=4.300×10(-3), OR=1.303 [95% CI=1.117-1.520]). Haplotype analysis of the blocks containing the two positive markers also revealed a significant association. This is the first study to assess the possible association of the ACSM1 gene with a genetic susceptibility for MDD. Our data are the first to suggest a positive association of the ACSM1 gene with a genetic susceptibility for SCZ and MDD in the Han Chinese population."
25658585,25658585,Genetic analysis identifies DDR2 as a novel gene affecting bone mineral density and osteoporotic fractures in Chinese population.,"DDR2 gene, playing an essential role in regulating osteoblast differentiation and chondrocyte maturation, may influence bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis, but the genetic variations actually leading to the association remain to be elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether the genetic variants in DDR2 are associated with BMD and fracture risk. This study was performed in three samples from two ethnicities, including 1,300 Chinese Han subjects, 700 Chinese Han subjects (350 with osteoporotic hip fractures and 350 healthy controls) and 2,286 US white subjects. Twenty-eight SNPs in DDR2 were genotyped and tested for associations with hip BMD and fractures. We identified 3 SNPs in DDR2 significantly associated with hip BMD in the Chinese population after multiple testing adjustments, which were rs7521233 (P = 1.06×10-4, β: -0.018 for allele C), rs7553831 (P = 1.30×10-4, β: -0.018 for allele T), and rs6697469 (P = 1.59×10-3, β: -0.015 for allele C), separately. These three SNPs were in high linkage disequilibrium. Haplotype analyses detected two significantly associated haplotypes, including one haplotype in block 2 (P = 9.54×10-4, β: -0.016) where these three SNPs located. SNP rs6697469 was also associated with hip fractures (P = 0.043, OR: 1.42) in the Chinese population. The effect on fracture risk was consistent with its association with lower BMD. However, in the white population, we didn't observe significant associations with hip BMD. eQTL analyses revealed that SNPs associated with BMD also affected DDR2 mRNA expression levels in Chinese. Our findings, together with the prior biological evidence, suggest that DDR2 could be a new candidate for osteoporosis in Chinese population. Our results also reveal an ethnic difference, which highlights the need for further genetic studies in each ethnic group."
25644528,25644528,Effects of interaction between genetic variants in human leukocyte antigen DQ and granulysin genes in Chinese Han subjects infected with hepatitis B virus.,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of HLA-DQ and granulysin (GNLY) are reportedly associated with HBV infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of interactions between SNPs in HLA-DQ and GNLY on the outcome of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Chinese Han subjects. HLA-DQ (rs9275572) and GNLY (rs1866139 and rs11127) were genotyped in 310 subjects with HBV-related chronic liver disease, 295 in whom spontaneous clearance of HBV had occurred and 316 who had not been exposed to HBV. HLA-DQ rs9275572 was significantly correlated with HBV clearance (dominant genetic model: OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.30-2.61; adjusted P = 0.001). There was no statistical association of GNLY rs1866139 and rs11127with HBV infection outcomes. However, significant sex-specific associations with HBV susceptibility were observed in men who carried rs1866139 CG or rs11127 TC and in women who carried rs1866139 GG or rs11127 CC. The findings were the same in the validation cohort, which was composed of 829 subjects. Based on a multifactor dimensionality reduction test with permutation correction, a three-way interaction between SNPs in HLA-DQ and GNLY was identified in terms of HBV clearance. In conclusion, additional evidence for an association of HLA-DQ and GNLY SNPs with HBV infection outcomes has been identified and a SNP-SNP interaction between HLA-DQ and GNLY on HBV clearance observed."

We hypothesized that common genetic variants in the VEGFA gene may be associated with SCZ. In our study, seven tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within VEGFA were genotyped in 1034 SCZ patients and 952 healthy controls in the Han Chinese population. No significant differences of allele and genotype distributions of the 7 tag SNPs were identified between SCZ patients and healthy controls. The AA genotype of rs699947 nominally decreased the risk of SCZ in recessive inheritance model (p=0.03, OR=0.65, 95%CI=0.44-0.95, adjusted p=0.18). No significant associations were found between different haplotypes and the risk of SCZ (p>0.05). Our findings suggested that the selected tag SNPs of VEGFA may not confer a susceptibility of SCZ in the Han Chinese population."

25639357,25639357,Evidence that the genetic polymorphism rs1412115 on chromosome 10 is associated with risk for oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"A genome-wide association study on schizophrenia in Jewish population discovered a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs1412115, on chromosome 10. It has been proved that neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) gene located on chromosome 10, tightly close to rs1412115, is associated with increased risk for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In the present study, we hypothesized that SNP rs1412115:A>G is associated with increased risk for OSCC. We therefore genotyped this polymorphism in 295 patients with OSCC and 594 cancer-free controls in the Chinese Han population, using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy. The pooled odds ratio was 1.42 (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.01-1.99, p=0.042) for carriers with the A version of the allele (AA and AG) compared with GG, and 1.46 (95% CI=1.02-2.09, p=0.036) for AG compared with GG. Our data provide evidence that the rs1412115: A>G polymorphism increases the risk of OSCC in Chinese Han populations. Larger population-based studies are needed to confirm these results."
25677673,25677673,Association analysis of TGFBR3 gene with Behçet's disease and idiopathic intermediate uveitis in a Caucasian population.,"Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is an important immunoregulatory cytokine in regulatory T cell (Treg) and Th17-mediated pathology, including uveitis due to Behçet's disease (BD). Of the three isoforms, TGFβ2 is found at highest levels in the aqueous humour of uninflamed eyes. TGFβ signals through a cell-surface receptor comprising three subunits (TGFBR1, 2 and 3). TGFBR3 is considered necessary for TGFβ2 signal transduction, but not for other isoforms. A polymorphism in TGFBR3 (rs1805110) has previously been identified in Han Chinese patients with BD.

25628894,25628894,Evaluation of four genetic variants in han chinese subjects with high myopia.,"High myopia is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. However, the exact etiology of high myopia remains unraveled despite numerous attempts of elucidation. Previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) has revealed that four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs2969180, rs1652333, rs9307551, and rs7837791, were associated with high myopia in Caucasians. The present study was conducted to investigate whether these genetic variants were associated with high myopia in Han Chinese. These four SNPs were genotyped by SNaPshot method in a Han Chinese cohort composed of 827 patients with high myopia and 988 healthy controls. Among the SNPs genotyped, only rs9307551 was found to be significantly associated with high myopia in this study. Carriers of rs9307551A allele, AA, and AC genotypes had an increased risk of high myopia (OR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.14-1.54; OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.28-2.38; OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.24-2.01, resp.). Interestingly, when split by gender, the association between rs9307551 and high myopia proved to be gender-specific with significance observed only in females but not males. These findings suggested that the SNP of rs9307551 showed a gender-specific association with high myopia in the Han Chinese population. In addition, LOC100506035, a lincRNA gene, might play a crucial role in the susceptibility to high myopia."

25629231,25629231,The association of ADORA2A and ADORA2B polymorphisms with the risk and severity of chronic heart failure: a case-control study of a northern Chinese population.,"The causes of chronic heart failure (CHF) and its progression are likely to be due to complex genetic factors. Adenosine receptors A2A and A2B (ADORA2A and ADORA2B, respectively) play an important role in cardio-protection. Therefore, polymorphisms in the genes encoding those receptors may affect the risk and severity of CHF. This study was a case-control comparative investigation of 300 northern Chinese Han CHF patients and 400 ethnicity-matched healthy controls. Four common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ADORA2A (rs2236625, rs2236624, rs4822489, and rs5751876) and one SNP of ADORA2B (rs7208480) were genotyped and an association between SNPs and clinical outcomes was evaluated. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the association. The rs4822489 was significantly associated with the severity of CHF after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors (p = 0.040, OR = 1.912, 95% CI = 1.029-3.550). However, the five SNPs as well as the haplotypes were not found to be associated with CHF susceptibility. The findings of this study suggest that rs4822489 may contribute to the severity of CHF in the northern Chinese. However, further studies performed in larger populations and aimed at better defining the role of this gene are required."
25631235,25631235,"Genetic association between APP, ADAM10 gene polymorphism, and sporadic Alzheimer's disease in the Chinese population.","Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by β-secretase and γ-secretase complex, and subsequently generates amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). The Aβ cascade is widely accepted as playing a role in the pathogenesis Alzheimer's disease (AD). Meanwhile, procession of APP by α-secretase (mainly a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10, ADAM10) precludes Aβ production, and produces soluble APP-α which is considered to be neuroprotective against AD. To explore the relationship between APP, ADAM10 gene polymorphism and sporadic AD (sAD), we conducted a case-control study in a Chinese Han cohort including 200 sAD patients and 243 control participants. Four target single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near the promoter of the APP gene and two in the promoter of the ADAM10 gene were selected and genotyped with a polymerase chain reaction-ligase detection reaction method. After adjustments for age, sex, and APOE ε4 status, only one target SNP, rs463946 was associated with the risk of sAD in the dominant (OR 1.52, 95 % CI 1.01-2.29, P = 0.045) and overdominant models (OR 1.59, 95 % CI 1.04-2.43, P = 0.031); the results also showed a borderline association of rs364048 (OR 1.53, 95 % CI 1.00-2.34, P = 0.048) and rs466433 (OR 1.53, 95 % CI 1.00-2.34, P = 0.048) with the risk of sAD in the overdominant model. However, these associations did not remain after multiple comparison correction. As for the ADAM10 gene, the two target SNPs (rs514049 and rs653765) were not associated with the risk of sAD either. No significant association was found between different haplotypes of the two genes and the risk of sAD. Conclusively, we did not find the association between APP, ADAM10 gene polymorphism, and the risk of sAD in our cohort of Chinese Han people."

To evaluate the influence of this SNP on risk of HIV-1 infection in a Chinese population, the CD4 genotype was determined by DNA sequencing in 101 HIV-1 patients and 102 healthy controls. No significant differences in the genotype and allele distributions of this polymorphism were observed among the patient and control groups. Additionally, binary logistic regression analyses adjusted by age and gender revealed that the C868T polymorphism was not associated with risk of HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, when analyses of genotype and allele frequencies were stratified by gender, similar nonsignificant results were found. Our study demonstrates a null association between the CD4 C868T polymorphism and an individual's susceptibility of HIV-1 acquisition in a Chinese population. Further studies are warranted to confirm these results."

In the present study, we systematically investigated the associations between the variants in the binding sites of an extensive transcription factor CTCF and lung cancer risk in Chinese population. A two-stage case-control design was conducted to evaluate the variants located at the uniform CTCF ChIP-seq peaks in a Chinese population (2,331 vs 3,077; 1,115 vs 1,346). The ChIP-seq data for CTCF, specified on lung cancer cell line A549, were downloaded from ENCODE database. Imputation was performed to increase the genome coverage in the CTCF binding regions. Three variants in CTCF binding sites were found to associate with lung cancer risk in the first stage.

In conclusion, the study suggested that a CLEC16A polymorphism may be protective against VKH syndrome in a Chinese Han population."
25578492,25578492,Genetic variations in monocarboxylate transporter genes as predictors of clinical outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and only a few molecular markers may be potentially used to predict clinical outcomes. Previous studies have demonstrated that monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) play important roles in the development and progression of many cancers. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MCT genes on prognosis of NSCLC patients in Chinese Han population. Nine functional SNPs in MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4 genes were selected and genotyped using Sequenom iPLEX genotyping system in 500 Chinese NSCLC patients receiving surgery. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier curve were used for the prognostic analysis. TT genotype of SNP rs1049434 (MCT1) was significantly associated with better overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.56, P = 0.026) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (HR = 0.57, P = 0.016) of NSCLC patients. TT genotype of another SNP rs995343 (MCT2) exhibited an association with worse RFS of NSCLC patients (HR = 1.46, P =  .039). Unfavorable genotypes of SNP rs1049434 and rs995343 showed a significant cumulative effect on OS and RFS of NSCLC patients. Moreover, we found that patients carrying AA+AT genotypes of rs1049434 showed significant OS and RFS benefits from adjuvant chemotherapy, but those with TT genotype did not. Our findings suggest that SNPs in MCT1 and MCT2 genes may affect clinical outcomes and can be used to predict the response to adjuvant chemotherapy in NSCLC patients who received surgical treatment once validated in future study."
25573672,25573672,An analysis of the association between a polymorphism of KCNJ11 and diabetic retinopathy in a Chinese Han population.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported that the polymorphism rs5219 of the potassium inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 11 (KCNJ11) is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Given that diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common microvascular complications of T2DM, GWAS have identified a number of potential susceptibility genes for DR. However, only a fraction of them have been replicated in different studies and show consistent genetic associations with the occurrence of DR. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether common variants of KCNJ11 confer DR in a cohort of the Chinese Han population."
25592814,25592814,Haplotype analyses of CYP17A1 genetic polymorphisms and coronary artery disease in a Uygur population.,The relationship between CYP17A1 genetic polymorphisms and coronary artery disease (CAD) remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between CYP17A1 gene polymorphism and CAD in a Chinese Uygur population.
25572230,25572230,Association of PPARγ gene polymorphisms with osteoarthritis in a southeast Chinese population.,"Primary osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability in developed countries. Currently no satisfactory treatment to stop disease progression exists. Recent studies suggest that activation of the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is an interesting therapeutic target for this disease. PPARγ is a transcription factor important for adipogenesis and adipocyte differentiation. Agonists of PPARγ inhibit inflammation and reduce generation of cartilage degradation products both in vitro and in vivo, and reduce the development/progression of cartilage lesions in OA animal models. However, there are no studies to assess the role of PPARγ in OA susceptibility of human peripheral joints in a Chinese population. We conducted a case-control study in a southeast Chinese population to determine the association of PPARγ gene polymorphisms (rs1801282, rs12629751, rs2292101, rs4135275 and rs1175543) with OA. One-hundred knee OA cases and 100 controls were studied. Statistically significant differences were detected in genotype and allele frequencies between OA and control groups in this population. For knee OA, the highest risk was associated with the variant allele T of the single nucleotide polymorphism rs12629751 (odds ratio (OR): 0.341, 95% confidence interval (CI):0.173-0.673, P = 0.002), and allele T of SNP rs12629751 (chi-square: 9.546, P = 0.002) could be considered as a risk factor of knee OA. Therefore, PPARγ mutation could be associated with the incidence of OA in a Chinese population. There is a significant association between the PPARγ polymorphism rs12629751 and susceptibility to knee OA in a southeast Chinese population."
25572744,25572744,Association of the IRF5 SNP rs2004640 with systemic sclerosis in Han Chinese.,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a complex disease involving multiple genetic factors. An association of the IRF5 polymorphism with SSc was reported in Caucasian populations of Europe and North America, as well as in Japanese populations. The present study aimed to examine whether the SSc-associated SNP rs2004640 of IRF5 gene confer susceptibility to SSc and clinical features of SSc in a Han Chinese population. A Han Chinese cohort consisting of 424 SSc patients and 502 healthy controls were examined in the study. TaqMan assays were carried out to examine the SNP. Exact p-values were obtained (Fishers test) from 2x2 tables of allele counts and disease status. SSc patients of Han Chinese showed increased homozygous TT genotype of the rs2004640 (p = 0.027, odds ratio (OR) = 1.4, CI =1.03-1.93), which was significantly associated with pulmonary fibrosis of SSc and ATA-positive SSc of Han Chinese. The lcSSc and ACA-positive SSc of Han Chinese appeared also in association with the increased T allele frequency. However, the Chinese dcSSc did not show any association with the rs2004640. The results were consistent with previous reports in other ethnic populations in supporting the notion that polymorphisms of IRF5 may play an important role in susceptibility to SSc."

Our previous genome-wide association study on acne has identified two new susceptibility loci. To search for potential gene-gene interactions and investigate the best-fit association models for the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from these interacting genes, we implemented logistic regression analysis in the combined sample of 2916 cases with severe acne and 4716 controls. The most significant association evidence was observed under an additive model for rs6896064 and under a dominant model the rest of these SNP. Significant interactions between these SNP were observed in this study: the SELL × MRPS36P2 (Padjusted = 4.15 × 10(-10)), TP63 × DDB2 (Padjusted = 7.62 × 10(-08)), DDB2 × CACNA1H (Padjusted = 1.89 × 10(-07)), ADAM19 × GNAI1 × CDH13 (Padjusted = 1.22 × 10(-04)) and ADAM19 × GABRG2 × GNAI2 × CDH13 (Pad justed = 6.33 × 10(-05)).

25561729,25561729,A solute carrier family 22 member 3 variant rs3088442 G→A associated with coronary heart disease inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response.,"Recent genome-wide association studies have identified single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) within the SLC22A3 (solute carrier family 22 member 3) gene associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) in the Caucasian population. We performed molecular analysis to investigate the potential role of SLC22A3 variants in CHD. Our study showed that the common polymorphism rs3088442 G→A, which is localized in the 3' UTR of the SLC22A3 gene, was associated with a decreased risk of CHD in the Chinese population by a case control study. In silico analysis indicated that G→A substitution of SNP rs3088442 created a putative binding site for miR-147 in the SLC22A3 mRNA. By overexpressing miR-147 or inhibiting endogenous miR-147, we demonstrated that SNP rs3088442 G→A recruited miR-147 to inhibit SLC22A3 expression. Moreover, SLC22A3 deficiency significantly decreased LPS-induced monocytic inflammatory response by interrupting NF-κB and MAPK signaling cascades in a histamine-dependent manner. Notably, the expression of SLC22A3(A) was also suppressed by LPS stimulus. Our findings might indicate a negative feedback mechanism against inflammatory response by which SLC22A3 polymorphisms decreased the risk of CHD."
25550865,25550865,Association of HLA-DQA1 (rs9272219) with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis in a Han Chinese population.,"HLA-DQA1 (rs9272219) has been previously reported that it is a susceptibility locus in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) of UK Caucasian population and North American; however, it has not reported in RA of Chinese population. Our study was to identify whether or not this relationship is reside between rs9272219 and RA in a Han Chinese population. 207 patients with RA and 199 control subjects were recruited. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of rs9272219 was tested in alleles and genotype frequencies and the data was analyzed by doing the statistic analysis of odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) from multivariate unconditional logistic regression analyses after pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) was estimated. Finally, the Alleles and genotype frequencies distribution of rs9272219 locus among RA patients and control subjects were in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We found significant association between rs9272219 and RA of Chinese population (OR 0.494, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.354-0.688, P = 0 and OR 2.541, 95% CI 1.695-3.808, P = 0, respectively). In this study, we found that the SNP of rs9272219 in HLA-DQA1 is a potential susceptibility locus in RA of Han Chinese population; the results suggest that HLA-DQA1 may be related to the development of RA."

A total of 2,865 unrelated individuals were enrolled from Linyi City, Shandong Province, China, including 1,139 patients of GD and 1,726 controls. All 9 SNPs showed significant associations with GD (P < 1.3×10(-4), Bonferroni corrected Pc < 0.001). The most significant association was detected at rs2281388 at the HLA-DPB1 locus (P=1.3×10(-21); OR=1.62, 95% CI: 1.47-1.79). After adjusting for gender and age, 7 SNPs remained significantly associated with GD (P < 3.4×10(-4), Pc < 0.003). The risk of GD caused by any of these SNPs was not significantly different between female and male participants (Phet > 0.15). Four SNPs located in MHC regions were significantly associated with GD in different ages (P < 8.4×10(-4), Pc < 0.04). The risks of any SNP leading to the development of GD did not differ significantly in different ages (P_trend > 0.02, Pc > 0.18). The rs6457617 at the HLA-DR-DQ locus was significantly correlated with gender in GD patients (P=0.004, Pc =0.04). No significant correlation was found between any SNP and age of diagnosis in GD patients (P > 0.02, Pc > 0.17). The 9 previously identified SNPs are associated with GD in the Chinese Han population. And, gender and age may not influence the associations between the 9 SNPs and GD."

25526816,25526816,Genetic association between germline JAK2 polymorphisms and myeloproliferative neoplasms in Hong Kong Chinese population: a case-control study.,"Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of haematological malignancies that can be characterised by a somatic mutation (JAK2V617F). This mutation causes the bone marrow to produce excessive blood cells and is found in polycythaemia vera (~95%), essential thrombocythaemia and primary myelofibrosis (both ~50%). It is considered as a major genetic factor contributing to the development of these MPNs. No genetic association study of MPN in the Hong Kong population has so far been reported. Here, we investigated the relationship between germline JAK2 polymorphisms and MPNs in Hong Kong Chinese to find causal variants that contribute to MPN development. We analysed 19 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the JAK2 locus in 172 MPN patients and 470 healthy controls. Three of these 19 SNPs defined the reported JAK2 46/1 haplotype: rs10974944, rs12343867 and rs12340895. Allele and haplotype frequencies were compared between patients and controls by logistic regression adjusted for sex and age. Permutation test was used to correct for multiple comparisons. With significant findings from the 19 SNPs, we then examined 76 additional SNPs across the 148.7-kb region of JAK2 via imputation with the SNP data from the 1000 Genomes Project."
25526981,25526981,Association between rs1344706 of ZNF804A and schizophrenia: a meta-analysis.,"Schizophrenia is one of the most serious mental diseases found in humans. Previous studies indicated that the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1344706 in the gene ZNF804A encoding zinc finger protein 804A was associated with schizophrenia in Caucasian population but not in Chinese Han population. However, current results are conflicting in Asian population. In the present study, a meta-analysis was performed to revisit the association between rs1344706 and the risk of schizophrenia in Asian, Caucasian and other populations. Electronic search of PubMed database identified 25 case-control studies with available genotype frequencies of rs1344706 for the meta-analysis, involving a total of 15,788 cases and 22,654 controls. A pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the association. The current meta-analysis showed an association between rs1344706 and schizophrenia in Caucasian populations (P=0.028, OR=1.138, 95% CI: 1.014-1.278; P=0.004 for heterogeneity) and Asian populations (P=0.008, OR=1.092, 95% CI: 1.023-1.165; P=0.001 for heterogeneity), but not in other populations (P=0.286, OR=1.209, 95% CI: 0.853-1.714, P=0.120 for heterogeneity). Egger's test (P>0.05) and Begg's test (P>0.05) are both suggestive of the lack of publication bias for the included studies. Thus, the absence of association in other populations suggests a genetic heterogeneity in the susceptibility of schizophrenia and demonstrates the difficulties in replicating genome-wide association study findings regarding schizophrenia across different ethnic populations. To validate the association between rs1344706 and schizophrenia, further studies with larger participant populations worldwide are needed."

Previous study showed that ADAMTS5 plays a role in suppression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression through its anti-angiogenic activity. The rs2380585 G>A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a missense mutation, located in the ADAMTS5 first TSR domain coding sequence (CDS). In this study, we investigated the impacts of ADAMTS5 rs2380585 polymorphism on the risk and progress of hepatocellular carcinoma. A total of 220 HCC patients and 220 controls in a Chinese Han population were enrolled and genotyped. The associations between SNPs and HCC incidence and progression were analyzed with logistic regression model. We found that individuals with the ADAMTS5 rs2380585 A allele was significantly associated with decreased HCC risk (OR = 0.348, 95 % CI 0.236-0.512; p = 0.000). Individuals having the ADAMTS5 rs2380585 polymorphic genotype (GA+AA) had an OR of 0.348 (95 % CI 0.201-0.600; p = 0.000) for developing HCC, compared with individuals having the ADAMTS5 rs2380585 ancestral genotype. However, stratified analyses did not find any evident gene-covariates interaction. The SNP of rs2380585 was irrelevant to the frequencies of clinicopathological characteristics. Our results for the first time indicate that ADAMTS5 rs2380585 polymorphism contributes to HCC susceptibility."

In this case-control study, the genotyping of TRAF1/C5 rs10818488 polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The frequencies of AA, AG and GG genotypes, and A and G alleles were 21.9%, 52.4%, 25.7%, 48.1% and 51.9%, respectively, in AA patients. There was no significant differences in terms of genotype and allele distributions between AA patients and healthy controls (P=0.687 and 0.955, respectively). Similar results were found between the two groups when stratified by the disease severity including very severe AA (vSAA), SAA and non-SAA (NSAA).

Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified eight NOA susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance of P < 5.0 × 10(-8) in Han Chinese from southeastern, northern, and central China. To better understand the role of the variants in conferring NOA risk, we selected four GWAS loci (HLA-DRA rs3129878, PRMT6 rs12097821, SOX5 rs10842262, and PEX10 rs2477686) that were reported before 2014 to investigate their association with NOA and their potential effects on sperm production in 1177 Han males from southwest China, including 545 patients with idiopathic NOA and 632 controls with normozoospermia. The results confirmed that the HLA-DRA rs3129878 was an NOA susceptibility locus in the present population. Along with our data, meta-analyses supported the association of the four GWAS-linked loci with NOA, whereas an additive effect of the four loci on NOA susceptibility was not found. Interestingly, the normozoospermic males with the risk genotypes of rs12097821 and rs3129878 + rs10842262 + rs12097821 were observed to have higher total sperm counts relative to non-risk genotypes, suggesting that the risk alleles of the genetic loci may not be via impairing spermatogenic ability to express susceptibility to NOA. These findings may advance our understanding of the role of the NOA susceptibility loci, although the results need to be confirmed in larger samples."

Thus, we conducted this association and meta-analysis study to further validate whether variants of those three loci affected the risk of idiopathic asthenozoospermia (AZS) and male infertility. Approximately 340 Chinese idiopathic AZS patients and 342 healthy men were included for this case-control study, genotyped by gel electrophoresis analysis or direct sequencing of PCR products. The eNOS mRNA isolated from the semen of patients was further examined by quantitative real-time PCR. Also, a meta-analysis of association between eNOS gene polymorphisms and male infertility was performed. A significant association was identified on allelic level between 4a4b variant and AZS in our study (chi-squared = 7.53, corrected P = 0.018, odds ratio (OR) = 1.808), while there were no significant difference of T-786C and G894T for asthenozoospermia in both genotype and allele distributions. In addition, expression of eNOS was up-regulated in patients compared with controls (about 2.4-fold, P < 0.001). Furthermore, the results of the meta-analysis support the conclusion that the T-786C and 4a4b loci were associated with male infertility in both Asian and Caucasian populations. Our study provides genetic evidence for the eNOS gene being a risk factor for idiopathic AZS and male infertility. Considering genetic differences among populations and complex pathogenesis of male infertility, more validating studies using independent samples are suggested in the future."

Our data indicated that rs2069762 GG, TG genotypes [GG: odds ratio (OR) = 2.6875, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.5948-4.5290, P < 0.0001; TG: OR = 1.6159, 95% CI = 1.2044-2.1681, P = 0.0013], and H3 haplotype (OR = 1.717, 95% CI = 1.050-2.808, P = 0.030) increased the risk of psoriasis. Furthermore, rs4833837 GG, GA genotypes (GG: OR = 0.2071, 95% CI = 0.0685-0.6266, P = 0.0022; GA: OR = 0.4711, 95% CI = 0.3289-0.6746, P < 0.0001), and H5 haplotype (OR = 0.482, 95% CI = 0.238-0.978, P = 0.039) were identified as protective factors for psoriasis. 4q27 polymorphisms are associated with psoriasis in the Northeastern Chinese Han population."
25476142,25476142,Association of an Exon SNP of SLC2A9 Gene with Hyperuricemia Complicated with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in the Chinese Male Han Population.,"Several recent genome-wide association studies and following studies have identified that genetic variants of SLC2A9 are associated with hyperuricemia (HUA) and diabetes mellitus (DM). Here, we set to investigate whether the exon 9 of SLC2A9 gene variations is associated with HUA complicated with Type 2 DM (T2DM) in the Chinese male Han population. The present study was designed to study rs2280205 polymorphism in exon 9 of SLC2A9 in 232 Chinese male subjects. Rs2280205 locus was genotyped in 52 T2DM subjects, 65 HUA subjects, 55 subjects with HUA complicated with T2DM, as well as 60 control subjects in this study. DNA from peripheral blood was purified and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were then digested by restriction enzyme MSPI, and part of PCR products was sequenced and analyzed. There was no significant difference in the levels of cholesterol, creatinine, and urea nitrogen between the Control Group and the HUA group. There was also no significant difference in levels of cholesterol between the DM group and Control Group. No significant difference in cholesterol and uric acid was observed between the HUA group and the HUA accompanied with DM group (P > 0.05). However, there was no statistical significance in the genotype frequency in these groups (P > 0.01). Results of the present study suggest that the exon 9 of SLC2A9 gene 109C/T polymorphism is not associated with HUA and diabetes in population living in the coastal area of Shandong province, China."

25470806,25470806,Association of Klotho and interleukin 6 gene polymorphisms with aging in Han Chinese population.,"Certain gene polymorphisms are associated with human aging. This study investigated polymorphisms of a metabolism-related gene, Klotho, and an inflammatory gene, IL6, for association with the aging process in a healthy Han Chinese population. A total of 482 healthy subjects were recruited and divided into aging and young groups according to chronological age and biological age. Snapshots were used to detect a Klotho gene tag SNP (rs571118) and the F-SNPs rs9536314 (F352V) and rs9527025 (C370S), and an interleukin 6 (IL-6) gene tag SNP (rs1524107) and the F-SNPs rs1800795 (-174G/C) and rs1800796 (-572G/C). Klotho F352V and IL-6-174G/C was G homozygous, C370S was T homozygous while IL-6-572G/C MAF less than 5%. There was a statistically significant difference in the Klotho rs571118 SNP between chronological age groups, but not biological age groups. However, other SNPs, including IL-6 gene SNPs, didn't correlate with age in the Han Chinese population. Human aging is a complex process that includes chronological and biological aging. Our current data showed that Klotho gene rs571118 SNP was associated with chronological aging, but not biological aging, in a Han Chinese population. Further study will investigate genetic build up for the difference between chronological and biological aging."
25479386,25479386,Association of GPR126 gene polymorphism with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in Chinese populations.,"Idiopathic scoliosis is the most common pediatric spinal deformity affecting 1% to 3% of the population, and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) accounts for approximately 80% of these cases; however, the etiology and pathogenesis of AIS are still uncertain. The current study aims to identify the relationship between G protein-coupled receptor 126 (GPR126) gene and AIS predisposition, to identify the relationship between the genotypes of the GPR126 SNPs and the clinical phenotypes of AIS. We conducted a case-control study and genotyped twenty SNPs of GPR126 gene including ten exonic SNPs and ten intronic polymorphisms in 352 Chinese sporadic AIS patients and 149 healthy controls. We provided evidence for strong association of three intronic SNPs of the GPR126 gene with AIS susceptibility: rs6570507 A > G (p =0 .0035, OR = 1.729), rs7774095 A > C (p = 0.0078, OR = 1.687), and rs7755109 A > G (p = 0.0078, OR = 1.687). However, we did not identify any significant association between ten exonic SNPs of GPR126 and AIS. Linkage disequilibrium analysis indicated that rs7774095 A > C and rs7755109 A > G could be parsed into one block. The association between the intronic haplotype and AIS was further confirmed in an independent population with 110 AIS individuals and 130 healthy controls (p = 0.046, OR = 1.680). Furthermore, molecular mechanisms underlying intronic SNP regulation of GPR126 gene were studied. Although intronic SNPs associated with AIS didn't influence GPR126 mRNA alternative splicing, there was a strong association of rs7755109 A > G with decreased GPR126 mRNA level and protein levels. Our findings indicate that genetic variants of GPR126 gene are associated with AIS susceptibility in Chinese populations. The genetic association of GPR126 gene and AIS might provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the potential functional SNPs in MIR196A2 promoter had effect on the susceptibility to gastric cancer (GC) in a Chinese population.We conducted a 2-stage case-control study (753 cases and 854 controls in testing set; 940 cases and 1061 controls in validation set) to evaluate the association between 2 potential functional SNPs in MIR196A2 promoter (rs12304647 A>C and rs35010275 G>C) and GC risk. The luciferase reporter assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were used to examine the functionality of the important polymorphism.We found that the rs35010275 C allele was significantly associated with the decreased risk of GC (adjusted odds ratio = 0.85, 95% confidence interval = 0.77-0.94) in the combined case-control studies. The miR-196a expression levels in GC tissues were significantly higher than that in corresponding adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.001). Besides, each allele of rs35010275 displayed completely opposite effects to influence the transcription activity of MIR196A2 promoter via recruiting different transcription factors or complexes.The functional rs35010275 G>C polymorphism in MIR196A2 promoter was significantly associated with miR-196a expression and influenced the genetic susceptibility to GC."

25446781,25446781,Association study of UGT1A9 promoter polymorphisms with DILI based on systematically regional variation screen in Chinese population.,"Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is caused by unpredictable adverse drug reaction due mainly to the accumulation of hepatotoxic compounds in the liver resulting in significant damage. Drug-metabolizing enzymes have been prime targets for molecular studies relevant to DILI. The gene UGT1A9 mainly expresses in the liver and has an important role in drug metabolism. The Han Chinese has a very long and complex demographic history, and the population stratification arising from the interplay of different geographic areas may influence the polymorphism pattern. We selected 260 healthy subjects in three different geographic areas (including Xian, Shanghai and Liuzhou) for systemic screening and analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of UGT1A9. Eight SNPs were identified and no regional disparity exists among the three populations. Based on these results, 213 DILI patients from all over the Chinese mainland were further recruited to investigate possible association between UGT1A9 and DILI. We observed statistically significant associations between SNP rs2741045 and DILI at both allele and genotype levels (allele: P=0.032; genotype: P=0.029; after Bonferroni correction). Also, multivariate interaction analysis discovered the interaction between rs2741045 and age associated with DILI significantly. This is the first such screening study to investigate the association between UGT1A9 promoter polymorphisms and DILI in the Chinese population and it could provide the basis for further study of DILI mechanisms."

25472585,25472585,Association between polymorphisms of microRNA-binding sites in integrin genes and gastric cancer in Chinese Han population.,"Highly elevated expression of integrin has been observed in a variety of malignant tumors. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the microRNA-binding sites in the 3' UTR region of target genes may result in the level change of target gene expression and subsequently susceptible to diseases, including cancer. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between polymorphisms of microRNA-binding sites of integrin genes and gastric cancer (GC) in Chinese Han population. Five SNPs of the microRNA-binding sites in the 3' UTR region of integrin genes (rs1062484 C/T in ITGA3, rs17664 A/G in ITGA6, rs3809865 A/T in ITGB3, rs743554 C/T in ITGB4, and rs2675 A/C in ITGB5) were studied using high resolution melting (HRM) analysis in 1000 GC patients and 1000 unrelated controls. The polymorphism of SNP rs2675 was associated with susceptibility of GC [odds ratio (OR) = 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.28-0.97, P = 0.028]. In addition, genotype AA of rs2675 and genotype GG of rs17664 were associated with a lower chance of GC at stage 1b [OR = 0.39 (0.18-0.85), P = 0.009; and OR = 0.37 (0.17-0.78), P = 0.004, respectively]; also, the frequency of allele G of rs17664 was associated with a lower chance of stage 1b tumor [OR = 0.50 (0.26-0.95), P = 0.021]. Furthermore, the frequency of genotype AA and allele A of rs3809865 were associated with a higher risk of stage 4 GC [OR = 1.85 (1.11-3.09), P = 0.012; and OR = 1.52 (0.99-2.33), P = 0.043, respectively]. For rs17664, GG genotype and allele G appeared to be associated with a higher risk with GC with lymphatic metastasis 3b [OR = 1.76 (1.00-3.11), P = 0.036; and OR = 1.64 (0.98-2.75), P = 0.048, respectively]. Our data suggest that polymorphisms of the microRNA-binding sites in the 3' UTR region of integrin are associated with GC susceptibility (rs2675), tumor stage (rs2675, rs17664, and rs3809865), and lymphatic metastasis (rs17664) in Chinese Han population."
25446437,25446437,"Association of IL-1, IL-18, and IL-33 gene polymorphisms with late-onset Alzheimer׳s disease in a Hunan Han Chinese population.","Interleukin (IL)-1 plays an important role in Alzheimer׳s disease (AD), and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-1 gene have been shown to be associated with AD susceptibility. IL-18 and IL-33 are proinflammatory cytokines of the IL-1 family, and increasing evidence has accumulated to support their crucial role in AD pathogenesis. To examine whether SNPs in IL-1α (rs1800587), IL-1β (rs1143627), IL-18 (rs187238), and IL-33 (rs11792633) are associated with late-onset Alzheimer׳s disease (LOAD) in a Hunan Han Chinese population, we carried out a case-control study involving 201 LOAD patients and 257 healthy controls. No significant differences were found in genotype frequencies of rs1800587 between LOAD patients and controls (P=0.079), but the T allele of rs1800587 was associated with a significantly increased risk of LOAD (P=0.032, odds ratio (OR)=1.592). Significant differences in genotype (P=0.004) and allele (P=0.001) frequencies of rs11792633 were found between LOAD patients and controls, but not for rs1143627 (P=0.535, 0.262, respectively) or rs187238 (P=0.257, 0.139, respectively). The T allele of rs11792633 was found to be a protective factor for LOAD (OR=0.648). These findings suggest that the IL-1α SNP rs1800587 and IL-33 SNP rs11792633, but not the IL-1β SNP rs1143627 or the IL-18 SNP rs187238, contribute to LOAD susceptibility in the Hunan Han Chinese population. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: Brain and Memory."
25460819,25460819,Polymorphisms in the CISH gene are associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis in the Chinese Han population.,"A recent multi-center case-control study identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the cytokine-inducible SRC homology 2 domain (CISH) gene that are associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB) in both African and Asian populations. To acquire a more robust and well-powered estimate of the putative influence of these SNPs on TB susceptibility, we conducted a well-designed case-control study in the Chinese Han population. We genotyped 3 previously identified SNPs within CISH in 600 patients with pulmonary TB and 618 healthy controls, and we calculated the pooled P-values and ORs of several studies that have also been conducted in the Chinese populations. The results of the case-control study showed that the C allele of rs2239751 and the T allele of rs414171 are associated with TB susceptibility, and this association exists only in women and young adults. The pooled analysis indicated that both SNPs are significantly associated with TB in the global populations and Chinese populations. The current study confirms that variants of CISH are associated with susceptibility to TB, suggesting that negative regulators of cytokine signaling may have a role in immunity against TB infection. We hypothesize that CISH and estrogen may interact in the cytokine-dependent regulation of the immune system."
25455162,25455162,A systematic review of genetic studies of thyroid disorders in Taiwan.,"A systematic review of genetic studies of thyroid disorders in Taiwan identified studies of gene mutations involved in the synthesis and binding of thyroid hormone, as well as mutations of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in thyroid cancer. Studies related to gene polymorphisms in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) and thyroid cancer were also reviewed. The most prevalent mutations in the Han-Chinese population were c.2268insT in the thyroid peroxidase (TPO) gene and c.919-2A>G in the Pendred syndrome (PDS) gene. Additional mutations have also been revealed in the genes encoding TPO (n = 5), thyroglobulin (TG; n = 6), pendrin (n = 2), and thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG; n = 2), which were novel at the time they were reported. The prevalence of various somatic mutations in differentiated thyroid cancer was similar in Taiwan and Western countries, with the RAS kinase mutation and tyrosine receptor kinase (TRK) and rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogenes being detected in lower frequencies and the B-type RAF kinase (BRAF) mutation accounting for the majority of cases. Recent microRNA analysis revealed an association between miR146b and the BRAF mutation, which was associated with poor prognosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Susceptibility to Graves' disease (GD) was linked to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. The associated alleles were different in Han-Chinese and Caucasians; HLA-DPB1*0501, the major allele in Taiwan, has a low frequency in the West. By contrast, a high frequency of HLA-DRB1*0301 was detected in Caucasians but not Han-Chinese. In addition to the HLA region, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated molecule-4 (CTLA4) gene polymorphisms +49G>A and +6230G>A (CT60) were positively associated with GD. The GG genotype and G allele of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) +49G>A were also related to relapse of Graves' hyperthyroidism after antithyroid drug withdrawal. Differences in the genetic patterns between Han-Chinese and Caucasians for some thyroid disorders suggest the importance of variable genetic influences in different populations."
25433484,25433484,Meta-analysis of Hsa-mir-499 polymorphism (rs3746444) for cancer risk: evidence from 31 case-control studies.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of endogenous, small and non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression negatively at the post-transcriptional level by suppressing translation or degrading target mRNAs, and are involved in diverse biological and pathological processes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which are located in the miRNA-coding genes may participate in the process of development and diseases by altering the expression of mature miRNA. Recent studies investigating the association between hsa-mir-499 polymorphism (rs3746444) and cancer risk have yielded conflicting results."
25430040,25430040,Association of Toll-like receptor 7 and 8 gene polymorphisms with Graves' disease in Chinese Cantonese population.,"Graves' disease (GD) is a common polygenic multifactorial autoimmune disease. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play critical roles in the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses. This study investigated the association of TLR7 and TLR8 gene polymorphisms with susceptibility of GD. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), namely, rs179019, rs179010 and rs3853839 in TLR7 and rs3764880 and rs5744088 in TLR8, were evaluated in 332 GD patients and 351 controls using High-Resolution Melting analysis. After adjusting for age, SNP rs179010 was found to decrease the risk of GD in females (OR(T vs C) = 0.64, P = 0.004). In the additive model, the risk of GD decreased significantly as the number of T alleles increased in females [odds ratio (OR) = 0.67 (0.50-0.90), P = 0.007]. The multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed the independent contribution of rs179010 to the protective effect against GD. This study indicates that rs179010 in TLR7 may be associated with the decreased susceptibility to GD in Chinese Cantonese."
25450149,25450149,SORL1 gene polymorphism association with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.,"We examined the relationship between loci polymorphisms (rs689021, rs3824966, and rs1784933) of the sortilin-related receptor 1 gene (SORL1) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in the Chinese Han population of the Hunan Changsha region. A case-control association analysis was used. Clinical data and peripheral blood were collected from 201 Alzheimer's disease patients and 257 healthy controls. PCR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry detection technologies were used to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distribution at SORL1 gene loci. Genotype and allele frequency differences were analyzed and compared between groups. No significant differences were found in genotype frequency distributions of the rs689021 and rs3824966 loci. Similarly, allele frequency distributions of the C and T alleles of rs689021, and the C and G alleles of rs3824966 showed no significant differences. However, the genotype frequency distribution of the rs1784933 locus was significantly different, and the allele frequency distribution of the A and G alleles were also significantly different. Multifactor logistic regression analysis showed that after correcting for confounding factors such as gender, age, and cholesterol, LOAD risk in rs1784933 AA genotype carriers was 1.803 times that in AG+GG genotype carriers. SORL1 gene SNPs at rs689021 and rs3824966 loci show no relationship with LOAD onset in the Chinese Han population of the Hunan Changsha region. Conversely, a SORL1 gene SNP at the rs1784933 locus is associated with LOAD onset, with the A allele being a risk factor."
25446846,25446846,Identification of a single nucleotide promoter polymorphism regulating the transcription of ubiquitin specific protease 18 gene related to the resistance to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection.,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), characterized by reproductive failure in sows and respiratory disease and mortality in piglets, is a major infectious disease that causes great economic loss throughout the world. Previous studies revealed that the overexpression of porcine ubiquitin specific protease 18 (USP18) gene inhibits PRRSV replication in vitro. The objective of this study is to compare the promoter activity of USP18 in Chinese indigenous Dapulian (DPL) pigs and Duroc×Landrace×Yorkshire (DLY) commercial pigs and screen single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) affecting porcine USP18 transcription. We found that the promoter activity was significantly higher in DPL pigs than DLY commercial pigs (p<0.05), deletion of the promoter from -1790 to -1314bp decreased the transcriptional activity by roughly 60% (p<0.05) and a SNP G-1533A in this region increased the mRNA expression both prior to and post PRRSV infection in MARC-145 cells. Population genetics analysis showed that allele A was only detected in Chinese pig breeds which are generally resistant to PRRSV. These results suggest that the SNP G-1533A polymorphism in the promoter region of porcine USP18 gene is a potential DNA marker for the resistance to PRRSV."

Pathogenic mechanisms remain obscure, but the neuropathological hallmark is the presence of α-synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic inclusions. Previous studies suggested that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs11931074, in the α-synuclein gene, SNCA, had highly significant association with an increased risk of the development of MSA in the Caucasian subjects. In contrast, a Korean study failed to identify an association with disease risk."

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset for ESCC, which included 453,852 SNPs from 1898 ESCC patients and 2100 control subjects of Chinese population, was reviewed. The identify candidate causal SNPs and pathways (ICSNPathway) analysis identified seven candidate SNPs, five genes, and seven pathways, which together revealed seven hypothetical biological mechanisms. The three strongest hypothetical biological mechanisms were as follows: rs4135113→TDG→BASE EXCISION REPAIR; rs1800450→MBL2→MONOSACCHARIDE BINDING; and rs3769823→CASP8→d4gdiPathway. The GWAS dataset was evaluated using the ICSNPathway, which showed seven candidate SNPs, five genes, and seven pathways that may contribute to the susceptibility of patients to ESCC."
25414272,25414272,Association between polymorphisms of the insulin-degrading enzyme gene and late-onset Alzheimer disease.,"The insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) gene is a strong positional and biological candidate for late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) susceptibility, with recent studies independently demonstrating an association between IDE gene variants and LOAD. However, previous data have been controversial. To investigate the relationship between IDE gene polymorphisms and LOAD risk, a case-control association study of 406 Han Chinese participants in Xinjiang, China, was undertaken. The LOAD and control groups consisted of 202 and 204 participants, respectively. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs1887922 and rs1999764 of the IDE gene were linked to LOAD incidence. The presence of the CT+CC genotype of rs1999764 had a protective effect compared to the TT genotype (adjusted P=.0001; odds ratio [OR]=0.226; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.116-0.441), while the CT+CC genotype of rs1887922 was associated with increased LOAD risk (adjusted P=.0001; OR=3.640; 95% CI=1.889-7.016). Moreover, the effects of rs1887922 and rs1999764 were associated with LOAD risk independent of the apolipoprotein E ∊4 polymorphism and were more significant in men and women, respectively. These results demonstrate that the polymorphisms rs1887922 and rs1999764 of the IDE gene are associated with LOAD susceptibility in the Xinjiang Han population."
25419437,25419437,Association between polymorphisms and haplotypes of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene and asthma in a Chinese Han population.,"Conflicting data have been reported on the association of variants of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) gene with asthma etiology. To provide a scientific basis for the prevention and treatment of asthma, the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes of ADRB2 and asthma was examined in a Chinese Han population. Six loci (base positions -2387, -47, 46, 79, 491, and 523) of ADRB2 were examined in a group of individuals with asthma (n = 429) and a control group of individuals who do not have the disease (n = 483). Polymorphisms at the -47 locus [odds ratio (OR) = 0.789, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.398~0.961, P < 0.05) and the 79 locus (OR = 0.788, 95% CI: 0.394~0.948, P < 0.05) and haplotype III (CCGGC; OR = 0.705, 95% CI: 0.412~0.973, P < 0.05) were correlated with asthma susceptibility and may affect the incidence of asthma in a Chinese Han population by conferring a protective effect. By examining several polymorphisms and haplotypes, this study yields a more comprehensive examination of the role of the ADRB2 gene in the pathogenesis of asthma."
25393565,25393565,The association between the polymorphisms in a sodium channel gene SCN7A and essential hypertension: a case-control study in the Northern Han Chinese.,"Nax , an α-subunit of the sodium channel encoded by the SCN7A gene, has been deemed to be a sensor of the concentration of sodium in the brain and may be involved in salt intake behavior. We inferred that Nax /SCN7A may participate in the regulation of blood pressure and the pathogenesis of essential hypertension (EH). The present case-control study involving 615 hypertensives and 617 normotensives was performed to investigate the association between SCN7A polymorphisms and EH in the Northern Han Chinese population. The three common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs3791251, rs6738031, rs7565062) in the exons of SCN7A were genotyped with the TaqMan assay. Significant association between SNP rs7565062 and EH was found under the addictive and dominant genetic models (P = 0.024, OR = 1.283, 95%CI [1.033-1.592]; P = 0.013, OR = 1.203, 95%CI [1.040-1.392]; respectively). The three SNPs were in close pair-wise linkage disequilibrium with each other and the haplotype analyses indicated that haplotype G-A-T was significantly associated with increased risk of EH (P = 0.023, OR = 1.290). In conclusion, our data showed that SNP rs7565062 of SCN7A was significantly associated with EH and the allele T of rs7565062 or the related haplotype G-A-T will be a genetic risk factor for EH in the Northern Han Chinese population."

25390504,25390504,Association of selenoprotein S gene polymorphism with ischemic stroke in a Chinese case-control study.,"Previous studies showed that selenoprotein S (SELS) was associated with a range of inflammatory markers, and its gene expression was influenced by a polymorphism in the promoter region. The genetic basis of the ischemic stroke has now been largely determined, so the aim of the study was to examine the role of SELS genetic variants in the ischemic stroke risk in a Chinese population. We conducted a case-control study with 239 ischemic stroke patients and 240 controls. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SELS genes were analyzed for association with the risk of ischemic stroke in the Chinese Han population. No evidence of ischemic stroke association was observed with the SNP rs34713741. Interestingly, the strongest evidence showed that SELS SNP rs4965814 was associated with ischemic stroke (P < 0.05). We found a significant association with increased ischemic stroke risk in women carrying the CC genotype of rs4965814 [hazard ratio: 2.43(1.03-5.75)]; a similar trend was also found in men carrying the TC genotype of rs4965814 [hazard ratio: 1.81(1.06-3.08)]. SNP rs4965814 of SELS may affect the susceptibility to ischemic stroke. Understanding the inflammatory mechanisms of ischemic stroke may give new therapeutic targets to pharmacologists."

25398668,25398668,The evidence for the contribution of the autism susceptibility candidate 2 (AUTS2) gene in heroin dependence susceptibility.,"The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs6943555 in autism susceptibility candidate 2 (AUTS2) has been reported to be significantly associated with alcohol consumption in Europeans. In this study, we identified the SNP in AUTS2 contributing to the genetic susceptibility to heroin dependence. The potential association between heroin dependence and 21 SNPs (rs2270162, rs2851510, rs513150, rs595681, rs210606, rs10237984, rs13228123, rs10235781, rs6969375, rs6943555, rs10251416, rs17141963, rs12669427, rs723340, rs2293507, rs2293508, rs6960426, rs9886351, rs2293501, rs10277450, rs1918425) of AUTS2 was examined in a Chinese Han population using the MassARRAY system. The participants included 426 patients with heroin dependence and 416 healthy controls. Single SNP association, haplotype association, and clinical phenotype association were analyzed. Single SNP association revealed that AA homozygotes of rs6943555 were significantly over-represented in the patients with heroin dependence compared with the control subjects (P=0.0019). The patients with heroin dependence had a significantly higher frequency of the A allele (P=0.0003, odd ratio (OR)=1.429, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.175-1.738). Strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed in five blocks (D'>0.9). In block 2, significantly more A-A haplotypes (P=0.006 after Bonferroni corrections) and significantly fewer T-A haplotypes (P=0.040) were found in the patients with heroin dependence. The genotype and clinical phenotype correlation study of the rs6943555 carriers showed that the amount of heroin self-injection was lower in the patients with the AA genotype relative to AT+TT genotypes (P<0.01). Our results confirmed that, in addition to heroin consumption, the SNP rs6943555 of AUTS2 may also play an important role in the etiology of heroin dependence."
25382134,25382134,CAPN10 SNP43 G>A gene polymorphism and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Asian population: a meta-analysis of 9353 participants.,"A correlation between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)43 G>A in the calpain-10 (CAPN10) gene (i.e., CAPN10 SNP43) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) susceptibility has been suggested, but the evidence for such a relationship remains controversial. To explore the association of the CAPN10 SNP43 with T2DM in Asian populations, a meta-analysis including 9,353 participants from 20 individual studies in Asian populations was conducted. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were evaluated by a fixed-effect model or random-effect model. The relationship between CAPN10 SNP43 and T2DM was significant under allelic (OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.01-1.38, P = 0.03), recessive (OR: 1.236, 95% CI: 1.038-1.472, P =0.017), heterozygous (OR: 1.261, 95% CI: 1.053-1.512, P = 0.012), and additive (OR: 1.183, 95% CI: 1.014-1.381, P = 0.033) genetic models but not under dominant (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 0.78-1.62, P = 0.53) or homozygous (OR: 0.937, 95% CI: 0.648-1.355, P = 0.730) genetic models. CAPN10 SNP43 was significantly associated with T2DM susceptibility in Asian populations, especially in Chinese populations. Asians, particularly Chinese people with the SNP43 G allele of the CAPN10 gene may have an increased risk of developing T2DM."

However, the results were still in controversy. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the association between SNPs of IL15RA gene with susceptibility to OPLL in a Chinese Han population."
25385252,25385252,AdipoQ T45 G and G276 T Polymorphisms and Susceptibility to Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Among Asian Populations: A Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression.,Adiponectin (AdipoQ) is an adipose-derived plasma protein that plays an important role in hepatic lipoprotein-lipid metabolism. Emerging evidence have shown that two common polymorphisms (T45 G and G276 T) in the AdipoQ gene may contribute to increasing susceptibility to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); however individually published studies show inconclusive results. This meta-analysis aimed to derive a more precise estimation of the association of AdipoQ T45 G (rs2241766 T>G) and G276 T (rs1501299 G>T) polymorphisms with NAFLD risk.
25370935,25370935,PRKCH 1425G/A Polymorphism Predicts Recurrence of Ischemic Stroke in a Chinese Population.,"A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a nonsynonymous SNP (1425G/A) in PRKCH which was associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke. The purpose of this study was to examine whether this functional polymorphism is associated with stroke onset and prognosis in a Chinese population. We genotyped PRKCH 1425G/A using Improved Multiple Ligase Detection Reaction in 919 patients with ischemic stroke. Analyses of genotype association with onset and prognosis outcomes were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, and the Cox proportional hazards models. PRKCH 1425G/A was not associated with age of stroke onset (P = 0.323). However, this functional polymorphism was significantly associated with risk of stroke recurrence in recessive models (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.23; 95% confidential interval [CI], 1.06 to 4.68; P = 0.014), and this effect was more predominant among smokers (HR = 3.67; 95% CI, 1.47-9.18; P = 0.005). Moreover, the variant genotypes of PRKCH 1425G/A are an independent prognostic factor for ischemic stroke in the final multivariate Cox regression model. Our findings show that PRKCH 1425G/A may be a useful biomarker for predicting the recurrence of ischemic stroke."
25369983,25369983,Association between maternal single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes regulating glucose metabolism and risk for neural tube defects in offspring.,"Maternal pregestational hyperglycemia, diabetes, and obesity are well-established risk factors for neural tube defects (NTDs). As a common underlying mechanism, the imbalance of glucose homeostasis is directly related to the development of NTDs. Polymorphisms in genes regulating glucose metabolism in women may impact their chance of having an NTD-affected pregnancy."
25381599,25381599,Association study of single nucleotide polymorphisms in mature microRNAs and the risk of thyroid tumor in a Chinese population.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that are involved in a variety of cellular functions. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in mature miRNAs (mmSNPs), some of which have been linked to cancer risk; however, it is unclear which mmSNPs contribute to the susceptibility to thyroid tumors. In the present study, we examined the influence of selected mmSNPs on the risk of thyroid tumor. After systematic in silico screening, seventeen mmSNPs were identified and genotyped in a Chinese population including 828 patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), 488 patients with benign thyroid tumor (BN), and 1038 cancer-free controls. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the association of SNP genotypes and alleles with the risk of developing PTC and BN. Three SNPs (rs67106263 in mir-3144, GA versus GG, OR = 1.35, 1.09-1.68; rs4919510 in mir-608, CC versus GG/GC, OR = 0.76, 0.60-0.97; and rs79402775 in mir-933, AA versus GG/GA, OR = 1.76, 1.00-3.12) were associated with PTC risk. A combined effect of unfavorable genotypes was observed to give increased PTC risk in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, three SNPs (rs10061133 in mir-449b, rs79402775 in mir-933 and rs4919510 in mir-608) showed at least borderline correlations with the risk of BN. False-positive report probability was assessed for significant findings. The rs67106263 SNP was associated with the expression level of mir-3144 in thyroid tissue. These results indicate that mmSNPs may contribute to genetic susceptibility to thyroid tumors. Large validation and functional studies are required to further explore the role of mmSNPs in carcinogenesis."

Previous studies have shown that there is a genetic component to ESRD. Studies attempting to determine which genetic variants are related to DN in Han Chinese are limited. A case-control study was conducted to identify DN susceptibility variants in Han Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes."
25354934,25354934,Genetic variant in NDUFS1 gene is associated with schizophrenia and negative symptoms in Han Chinese.,"Abnormalities in mitochondrial complex I, which is responsible for controlling mitochondrial function, have been implicated in a variety of diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, potentially including schizophrenia. The NADH dehydrogenase Fe-S protein 1 (NDUFS1) is the largest subunit of complex I. To explore whether the encoding NDUFS1 gene confers susceptibility to schizophrenia or is associated with the severity of typical symptoms of schizophrenia, we recruited 519 stable schizophrenia patients receiving clozapine treatment and 594 healthy controls for genotyping to investigate the association of four selected tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NDUFS1 and both schizophrenia risk and symptom severity. The severity of psychotic symptoms was evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and then tested for association with the four SNPs. The SNP rs1044120 showed significant association with schizophrenia (adjusted P=0.032). The frequency of the G allele of rs1044120 was significantly higher in patients than among the healthy controls (adjusted P=0.008). Stratification by sex revealed a significant association between the rs1044120 polymorphism and schizophrenia among males (adjusted P=0.036 and 0.008 in genotypic and allelic comparisons, respectively). We also observed a significant difference in the negative symptom scores among the three genotypes among these males (adjusted P=0.036). Post hoc comparisons showed that rs1044120 G/G carriers had higher negative symptom scores than those with G/T and T/T carriers (raw P=0.035 and 0.005, respectively). Our findings suggest that NDUFS1 may confer susceptibility to schizophrenia in male subjects, acting as a causative factor for the severity of negative symptoms in schizophrenia."
25352360,25352360,Association between polymorphism of GLI1 gene SNP rs2228226 and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in Chinese population.,"A non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs2228226C>G), in exon 12 of glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) (Q1100E), encodes a change from glutamine to glutamic acid (Q1100E). The variant GLI1 protein exhibited reduced transactivation function in vivo, decreasing the ability of activating hedgehog signal, which has been proposed as an unfavorable prognostic marker in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The GLI1 Q1100E (NCBI SNP ID: rs2228226) genotypes in 155 CLL patients were detected by direct sequencing. The difference between frequencies of GLI1 Q1100E genotype among CLL patients and controls was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that in comparison with G/G, GLI1 SNP1100 C/C genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of CLL (OR 3.787, 95% CI 1.814-7.907, p < 0.001). Compared with the SNP1100 C/G genotype, C/C genotype significantly increased the risk of CLL (OR 3.860, 95% CI 1.827-8.153, p < 0.001). In addition, combining C/G with G/G, C/C genotype also significantly increased the risk of CLL (OR 3.820, 95% CI 1.885-7.742, p < 0.001). The comparison between frequencies of C and G allele of GLI1 was also statistically significant (p = 0.004). In the entire cohort, SNP1100 genotypes were found in association with Binet stage (p = 0.045) and trisomy 12 (p = 0.036). By comparing C/C with G allele (C/G+G/G) genotype, there was a significant correlation with trisomy 12 (p = 0.013). This study demonstrated that GLI1 Q1100E polymorphism was closely associated with CLL. C/C genotype contributes to the risk of developing CLL and correlates with trisomy 12. Patients with trisomy 12 are susceptible group of CLL."

Here, we assessed association of two of these variants, rs11892031 (2q37.1 region) and rs401681 (5p15.33 region) in a Chinese case-control study, which included 367 bladder cancer cases and 420 controls. We found that the AC genotype of rs11892031 was associated with remarkably decreased risk of bladder cancer (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 0.27; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.09-0.81; p=0.019), compared with the AA genotype of rs11892031; and that CT/CC genotypes of rs401681 were associated with significantly increased risk of bladder cancer (adjusted OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.10-2.91; p=0.02), compared with the TT genotype of rs401681. We further conducted stratification analysis to examine the correlation between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11892031/rs401681 and tumor grade/stage. Results showed that heterogeneity in ORs of tumor categories was not significant for either rs11892031 or rs401681 (p>0.05), indicating that the two SNPs seemingly do not associate with tumor grade and stage of bladder cancer in our study population. The present study suggests that the SNPs rs11892031 and rs401681 are associated with bladder cancer risk in a Chinese population. Future analyses will be conducted with more participants recruited in a case-control study."
25337833,25337833,"Association between cytochrome CYP17A1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A43 polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness in a Korean study population.","In this study, we evaluated genetic variants of the androgen metabolism genes CYP17A1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A43 to determine whether they play a role in the development of prostate cancer (PCa) in Korean men. The study population included 240 pathologically diagnosed cases of PCa and 223 age-matched controls. Among the 789 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) database variants detected, 129 were reported in two Asian groups (Han Chinese and Japanese) in the HapMap database. Only 21 polymorphisms of CYP17A1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A43 were selected based on linkage disequilibrium in Asians (r2 = 1), locations (SNPs in exons were preferred), and amino acid changes and were assessed. In addition, we performed haplotype analysis for the 21 SNPs in CYP17A1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A43 genes. To determine the association between genotype and haplotype distributions of patients and controls, logistic analyses were carried out, controlling for age. Twelve sequence variants and five major haplotypes were identified in CYP17A1. Five sequence variants and two major haplotypes were identified in CYP3A4. Four sequence variants and four major haplotypes were observed in CYP3A43. CYP17A1 haplotype-2 (Ht-2) (odds ratio [OR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.18) was associated with PCa susceptibility. CYP3A4 Ht-2 (OR: 1.87; 95% CI: 1.02-3.43) was associated with PCa metastatic potential according to tumor stage. rs17115149 (OR: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.04-3.68) and CYP17A1 Ht-4 (OR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.07-4.11) showed a significant association with histologic aggressiveness according to Gleason score. Genetic variants of CYP17A1 and CYP3A4 may play a role in the development of PCa in Korean men."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether polymorphisms in miR-218 LAMB3 pathway were associated with the risk and prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Pri-mir-218 rs11134527 and LAMB3 rs2566 were genotyped in ESCC patients and 745 controls to assess their associations with cancer risk and overall survival. Pri-mir-218 rs11134527 was significantly associated with a decreased risk of ESCC under codominant, recessive and additive models. Although there was a significant association between rs11134527 and better survival of ESCC patients under codominant, recessive and additive models, the association disappeared after adjustment for TNM and LNM. However, further stratified analysis revealed that the association remained significant in patients with TNM stages I and II or non-LNM. Our data suggest that pri-miR-218 rs11134527 may contribute to the genetic susceptibility and prognosis for ESCC in Chinese Han population."

25323654,25323654,Analysis of DAZL SNP260 and SNP386 in infertile Chinese males using multi-analyte suspension array.,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and infertility in Chinese males using multi-analyte suspension array (MASA). A total of 196 male patients with azoospermia or severe oligospermia (sperm density <5x106/ml, non‑obstructed) who had a normal karyotype and no azoospermia factor microdeletions were recruited, along with 40 healthy, fertile males as controls. Two SNPs of the deleted in azoospermia-like (DAZL) gene, SNP260 and SNP386, were genotyped by allele‑specific primer extension (ASPE) combined with MASA technology. The SNP260A>G and SNP386A>G mutations were found in the males with infertility. The SNP260, but not the SNP386, mutation was detectable in the control group. The mutation rates in the controls and patients were 2.5 and 3.06% for SNP260, and 0 and 2.04% for SNP386, respectively. A χ2 analysis did not identify any significant differences in the frequency of either mutation between the fertile and infertile males. In conclusion, the combination of ASPE and MASA methods for SNP genotyping was high‑throughput, accurate and cost‑efficient. The method was applied to detect SNP polymorphisms in the DAZL gene; and neither the A260G nor the A386G polymorphism of DAZL appeared to be involved in male infertility in the Chinese population."

25317213,25317213,Lack of Association of the CD247 SNP rs2056626 with Systemic Sclerosis in Han Chinese.,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a complex disease involving multiple genetic factors. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) indicated that CD247 was strongly associated with SSc, which was subsequently confirmed in a SSc cohort of European population. However, genetic heterogeneity in different ethnic populations may significantly impact the complex trait of SSc. The studies herein aimed to examine whether the SSc-associated SNP rs2056626 of CD247 identified in Caucasian is also associated with Han Chinese SSc. A Han Chinese cohort consisting of 387 SSc patients and 523 healthy controls were examined in the studies. TaqMan assays were performed to examine the SNP. Exact p-values were obtained (Fisher's test) from 2x2 tables of allele counts and disease status. The results showed that there was no association between rs2056626 of CD247 and SSc or any SSc subtypes of Han Chinese. The negative results are important in understanding genetics of SSc in different ethnic populations, which further suggest complex nature of genetics of SSc."

25308608,25308608,Interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 polymorphisms and antituberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity in Chinese population.,"Evidence demonstrates that the delicate balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines determines the further progress to severe injury or recovery. Therefore, understanding which cytokines are associated with the development of drug-induced hepatotoxicity (DIH) might guide the prevention and therapeutic direction. Some polymorphisms of cytokine genes have been reported to be associated with DIH involving interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α); however, these studies are still scanty with inconsistent results. In addition, most of these associations have not been investigated in antituberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity (ATDH) patients with the exception of TNF-α polymorphisms. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association between IL-4 and IL-10 gene polymorphisms with the risk of ATDH in a Chinese population."

To obtain a more precise estimation, we carried out a meta-analysis to analyze the effect of 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH on stroke risk. We searched PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Chinese Biomedical Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and WANFANG Data for all eligible case-control studies through April 2014. The odds ratios (ORs), together with the 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated to evaluate the strength of association between 1425G/A SNP and stroke risk. Overall, seven eligible studies involving a total of 4,574 cases and 5,471 controls were included in our meta-analysis. The results showed that the variant genotypes of 1425G/A polymorphism in PRKCH were significantly associated with a higher risk of stroke in all genetic models (GA vs. GG: OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.24-1.47, P < 0.001; AA vs. GG: OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.24-1.82, P < 0.001; GA/AA vs. GG: OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.26-1.49, P < 0.001; AA vs."
25266237,25266237,Genetic association study between INSULIN pathway related genes and high myopia in a Han Chinese population.,"To investigate the association between insulin (INS) pathway related genes, including INS, insulin receptor (INSR), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), IGF2 receptor (IGF2R) and IGF binding protein 1 (IGFBP1), and high myopia (HM) in a Han Chinese population, we have genotyped 24 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of these genes in this cohort by Sequenom MassARRAY method. The genotyping data was analyzed by χ(2) test and the linkage disequilibrium block structure was examined by Haploview software. SNPs in the INS-IGF2 region (rs2070762 and rs1003483), and the INSR gene (rs3745551 and rs2229429) showed significant association with HM (allelic P = 0.0085, 0.0494, 0.0171 and 0.0238, respectively). Under the model of risk genotype combination of INSR and IRS1, carrying the variant allele (A) of the IRS1 Gly972Arg SNP (rs1801278) further increased the risk among the rs2229429T allele carriers (odds ratio 6.865, 95 % confidence interval 1.533-30.745). None of the SNPs in the IGF2R and IGFBP1 genes were found to be significantly associated with HM.

25266802,25266802,The functional BRCA1 rs799917 genetic polymorphism is associated with gastric cancer risk in a Chinese Han population.,"BRCA1 is a crucial tumor suppressor which plays an essential role in maintaining genomic stability and integrity. Accumulated evidences demonstrated that there is frequent chromosome loss of BRCA1 or significant BRCA1 down-regulation via hypermethylation of its promoter in human gastric cancer specimens, highlighting the tumor-suppressing function of BRCA1 in gastric carcinogenesis. There is an rs799917 T>C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the BRCA1 coding sequence (CDS). This SNP can disturb the interaction between BRCA1 mRNA and miR-638 and result in significantly decreased BRCA1 expression among carriers of rs799917C allele. In this study, we investigated the association between rs799917 and gastric cancer risk in a Chinese Han population using a case-control design. A total of 660 gastric cancer patients and 800 controls were enrolled and genotyped. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by logistic regression. We found that individuals with the rs799917 CT genotype was significantly associated with gastric cancer risk (OR = 1.81, 95 % CI = 1.28-2.56; P = 0.001). Individuals having the rs799917 CC genotype had an OR of 1.40 (95 % CI = 1.17-1.68; P = 2.2 × 10(-4)) for developing gastric cancer, compared with individual having the rs799917 TT genotype. However, stratified analyses did not find any evident gene-covariates interaction. Our results for the first time indicate that the functional BRCA1 rs799917 polymorphism contributes to gastric cancer susceptibility."

To assay the association between this variant and schizophrenia, we genotyped 611 schizophrenic patients from Southern Chinese Han population for the risk single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1625579 using the SNaPshot technique and compared the clinical profiles of different genotypes. Additionally, a meta-analysis was performed using the combined sample groups from five case-control publications and the present study. Both the genotype and allele distributions of the rs1625579 SNP were significantly different between patients and controls (P = 0.036 and 0.026, SNP). TT genotype carriers showed slightly lower Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia- (BACS-) derived working memory performance than G carriers (15.58 ± 9.56 versus 19.71 ± 8.18, P = 0.045). In the meta-analysis, we observed a significant association between rs1625579 and schizophrenia under different genetic models (all P < 0.05). The results of our study and meta-analysis provide convincing evidence that rs1625579 is significantly associated with schizophrenia. Furthermore, the miR-137 polymorphism influences the working memory performance of schizophrenic patients in a Chinese Han population."
25261617,25261617,SNPs in the exons of Toll-like receptors are associated with susceptibility to type 1 diabetes in Chinese population.,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize a wide range of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) and mount the initiation of immune response. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exons of genes encoding TLRs might be responsible for the generation of an abnormal immune response which could lead to autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated the SNPs in TLRs in a Chinese population, and we hypothesized that SNPs in TLRs are associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D), an autoimmune disease caused by destruction of insulin producing pancreatic β-cells, in the studied population."
25257262,25257262,Relationship between human LTA4H polymorphisms and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis in an ethnic Han Chinese population in Eastern China.,"Two single nucleotide polymorphisms in Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) gene were reported to be associated with protection from pulmonary tuberculosis in Vietnamese population. But these associations were not found in the Russians. To investigate the association of LTA4H polymorphisms with tuberculosis in a Han Chinese population in Eastern China, we genotyped 5 SNPs of LTA4H gene in 743 of pulmonary tuberculosis patients, 372 of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis patients and 888 of healthy controls individuals. The CC and TT homozygotes of rs1978331 and rs2540474 were identified to have higher rates (P < 0.01) and be risk factors in the patients with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (OR = 1.412; 95% CI = 1.104-1.804 and(OR = 1.380; 95% CI = 1.080-1.764). However, no significant association was found between any of the SNPs and pulmonary tuberculosis. In the extra-pulmonary tuberculosis subgroups. LTA4H gene were significantly associated with tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, bone tuberculosis and other extra-pulmonary tuberculosis except for pleural tuberculosis. The present findings suggest that polymorphisms in the LTA4H gene may affect susceptibility to extra-pulmonary tuberculosis and change the risk of developing the disease in the Han nationality in the East China."
25232397,25232397,Genetic variation I148M in patatin-like phospholipase 3 gene and risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease among Filipinos.,"Genome-wide association studies have shown that a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism characterized by a C-to-G change encoding an isoleucine-to-methionine substitution at amino acid position 148 in the human patatin-like phospholipase 3 (PNPLA3) gene was found to be associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and advanced liver damage. A hospital-based study was conducted to determine the distribution of PNPLA3 genotypes among patients clinically diagnosed and histologically confirmed with NAFLD and among normal controls. We also compared the allelic frequencies of PNPLA3 with different ethnic populations. More importantly, we evaluated the association between PNPLA3 genetic variation and risk of developing NAFLD among Filipinos. Real-time PCR was performed using the Taqman SNP genotyping assay for rs738409. Nucleotide sequencing was performed to confirm the PNPLA3 genotypes. Allelic frequencies among normal controls were 0.83 and 0.17 for the PNPLA3 C and PNPLA3 G alleles, respectively. Calculated frequencies in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium were 72% for PNPLA3 C/C, 22% for PNPLA3 C/G, and 6% for PNPLA3 G/G genotype. There is a significant difference in the distribution of PNPLA3 genotypes between normal controls and NAFLD patients (p = 0.0172). However, there was no significant association found between PNPLA3 genotypes and risk of developing NAFLD after controlling for possible confounding effects (p = 0.0574). Allelic frequencies of PNPLA3 among Filipinos were statistically different from Hispanics, Japanese, and Han Chinese. In conclusion, genetic variation in PNPLA3 rs738409 C>G seems to be associated with NAFLD among Filipinos. Further studies are needed to replicate our observations in an independent larger population."
25264125,25264125,"Investigating the genetic association of HCP5, SPATA2, TNIP1, TNFAIP3 and COG6 with psoriasis in Chinese population.","Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease occurred under the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The genes HLA complex P5 (HCP5), spermatogenesis associated 2 (SPATA2), tumour necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), TNFAIP3-interacting protein 1 (TNIP1) and the component of oligomeric Golgi complex 6 (COG6) were reported to be associated with psoriasis in western populations by genome-wide association studies. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the HCP5, TNIP1, TNFAIP3, SPATA2 and COG6 genes were genetic risk factors for psoriasis in Chinese population. One single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) from each gene was evaluated using Chinese patients with psoriasis (n = 201) and controls (n = 300). The results demonstrated that SNPs rs2395029, rs17728338 and rs610604 from the HCP5, TNIP1 and TNFAIP3 genes, respectively, were associated with psoriasis in the studied population at both genotype level and allelic level (P < 0.05). Thus, the data suggested that HCP5, TNIP1 and TNFAIP3 may play a role in common pathogenic of psoriasis in Chinese and confer risk factors for psoriasis in various ethnic populations. These results provide potential makers for diagnosing, treating and preventing the psoriasis."
25246119,25246119,Family association study between tumour necrosis factor a gene polymorphisms and polycystic ovary syndrome in Han Chinese.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex disease involving genetic and environmental components. Tumour necrosis factor a (TNFa) is a proinflammatory cytokine in the pathogenesis of PCOS. The genetic association between polymorphisms of TNFa gene and PCOS was investigated. A family based study was conducted with 216 family trios (648 participants) having a proband with PCOS. Transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) was used to analyse the association between two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (rs1799964, rs1799724) of TNFa gene and PCOS. Minor allele frequencies of the SNP were 0.178 (rs1799964) and 0.118 (rs1799724). The two SNP were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; TDT was only conducted when one parent was heterozygous. Of 216 trios, 112 trios of rs1799964 and 76 trios of rs1799724 were tested. A significant difference in transmission was found for rs1799964 (transmitted: non-transmitted = 73 : 39; χ(2) = 10.321; P = 0.0013). rs1799724 showed no evidence of an association with PCOS; risk alleles were over transmitted (transmitted: non-transmitted = 43 : 33; χ(2) = 1.316). Transmission disequilibrium of the two SNP indicated that rs1799964 may participate in the pathogenesis of PCOS in Chinese women. These data provide a basis for further studies of TNFa in the cause of PCOS."
25242229,25242229,A polymorphism site in the pre‑miR‑34a coding region reduces miR‑34a expression and promotes osteosarcoma cell proliferation and migration.,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most prevalent primary malignant bone tumor in children and young adults, its complex etiology involving a combination of environmental and genetic factors. MicroRNA (miRNA) is a short, non‑coding regulatory RNA molecule that represses gene expression by imperfectly base‑pairing to the 3' untranslated region of target mRNAs. Evidence has shown that alterations in the expression of miRNA are involved in the initiation, progression, and metastasis of human cancers. It is believed that miRNAs function both as tumor suppressors and oncogenes during cancer development. In the present study, three tumor-associated miRNAs (miR‑21, miR‑34a and miR‑146a) coding regions were screened in Chinese‑Han OS patients. A G>A variation in the pre‑miR‑34a coding region was found to be associated with higher OS morbidity. By detecting the mature miR‑34a expression in cells transfected with pre‑miR‑34a expression vectors of different genotypes using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, it was demonstrated that the G>A variation reduced miR‑34a expression in vitro. This was in accordance with the data collected from tumor tissue and patient serum samples. Subsequently, a dual‑luciferase reporter assay and western blot analysis were used to detect the site variation effect on the expression of c‑Met, a target gene of miR‑34a. The G>A variation downregulated the suppression of c‑Met in two OS cell lines. Furthermore, it was found that reduced miR‑34a expression decreased the suppression of OS cell proliferation in vitro. In conclusion, the present study established the association between miR‑34a and the risk of suffering OS in a Chinese Han population by identifying one functional single nucleotide polymorphism site in pre‑miR‑34a. These findings may give insight into the mechanism of OS development and create an opportunity to approach the diagnosis and treatment of OS."

A recent genome-wide association study identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs1625579) in microRNA-137 (miR-137) as a possible susceptibility locus for SCZ. Hoping to validate this finding, we conducted a case-control study of the Han Chinese population, with 506 SCZ cases and 522 healthy controls, using the Ligase detection reaction-polymerase chain reaction method to genotype the polymorphism rs1625579 in the miR-137 gene. However, we found no significant difference (P > 0.05) in either allele or genotype frequency in this SNP between patients and controls. In addition, a meta-analysis indicated that the 'T' allele of SNP rs1625579 was not associated with susceptibility to SCZ in Han Chinese populations (pooled OR 1.087, 95 % CI 0.847-1.396, P = 0.512). Thus, these results do not support the previous finding suggesting further replication studies using a large-scale association analysis that should be warranted in Han Chinese populations."

25230923,25230923,Association study of developmental dyslexia candidate genes DCDC2 and KIAA0319 in Chinese population.,"Developmental dyslexia (DD) is characterized by difficulties in reading and spelling independent of intelligence, educational backgrounds and neurological injuries. Increasing evidences supported DD as a complex genetic disorder and identified four DD candidate genes namely DYX1C1, DCDC2, KIAA0319 and ROBO1. As such, DCDC2 and KIAA0319 are located in DYX2, one of the most studied DD susceptibility loci. However, association of these two genes with DD was inconclusive across different populations. Given the linguistic and genetic differences between Chinese and other populations, it is worthwhile to investigate association of DCDC2 and KIAA0319 with Chinese dyslexic children. Here, we selected 60 tag SNPs covering DCDC2 and KIAA0319 followed by high density genotyping in a large unrelated Chinese cohort with 502 dyslexic cases and 522 healthy controls. Several SNPs (Pmin = 0.0192) of DCDC2 and KIAA0319 as well as a four-maker haplotype (Padjusted = 0.0289, Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.3400) of KIAA0319 showed nominal association with DD. However, none of these results survived Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Thus, the association of DCDC2 and KIAA0319 with DD in Chinese population should be further validated and their contribution to DD etiology and pathology should be interpreted with caution."

Then, Haploview (version 4.2) was used to calculate linkage disequilibrium (LD) statistics for the selected 32 common SNPs with a minor allele frequence (MAF) more than 0.05. Haplotype blocks were constructed throughout the p75NTR gene according to the upper and the lower 95% confidence bound of D' value, and the tag SNPs were selected based on the r2 and LOD values between SNPs as well as the results of bioinformatics analysis. The results indicated that five haplotype blocks were constructed within and around p75NTR gene and 12 tag SNPs including rs2537710, rs603769, rs614455, rs2537706, rs534561, rs2072445, rs2072446, rs7219709, rs734194, rs741071, rs741073 and rs2671641 were selected to represent the other 51 SNPs in p75NTR gene. Therefore, the 12 selected SNPs may act as tag SNPs for the entire p75NTR gene in Chinese Han population, which will provide an effective way to select tag SNPs in a whole gene, and its biological significance is to further guide the clinical association studies between the candidate gene and disease susceptibility."

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in miRNAs that can regulate the expression of EGFR could potentially influence the development of psoriasis. The present study investigated the association between a functional SNP of rs2910164 in miR-146a and the risk of psoriasis in the Chinese Han population. A total of 521 Han Chinese patients with psoriasis and 582 healthy controls were recruited in this study. The miR-146a rs2910164 SNP was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Overall, a significantly increased risk of psoriasis was associated with the rs2910164 miR-146a CG and GG genotypes (adjusted OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.06-1.80). Furthermore, the rs2910164G allele in miR-146a attenuated its inhibitory regulation on the expression of EGFR as well as the proliferation of human keratinocytes, and lowered the level of miR-146a in the psoriatic lesions. These findings indicate that the rs2910164G allele in miR-146a weakens its suppression on the proliferation of keratinocytes probably through the decreased inhibition of the target gene, EGFR, which may account for the increased risk of psoriasis in this study population."

Through genotyping the rs895819 SNP in 254 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and 238 healthy controls by polymerase chain reaction-restricted fragment length polymorphism, a case-control study was performed to investigate a possible association between a common A/G polymorphism (rs895819) within hsa-mir-27a and susceptibility to CRC in a Chinese Han population. In addition, after examining miR-27a expression levels in CRC tissues (N=57) obtained from these CRC patients, we found that subjects with variant genotypes (AG+GG) had a significantly increased risk of developing CRC compared to AA carriers (odds ratio (OR)=1.619, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.129-2.322). The elevated risk was especially evident in older (age≥60 years) and male subjects. Further functional analyses indicated that the relative expression of miR-27a was significantly greater in tumor tissues from GG patients or patients carrying at least one G allele than in those from AA patients. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence that an miR-27a polymorphism contributes to CRC susceptibility in the Chinese Han population by modulating mature miR-27a expression."

25215500,25215500,Replication of the 4p16 susceptibility locus in congenital heart disease in Han Chinese populations.,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common form of congenital human birth anomalies and a leading cause of perinatal and infant mortality. Some studies including our published genome-wide association study (GWAS) of CHD have indicated that genetic variants may contribute to the risk of CHD. Recently, Cordell et al. published a GWAS of multiple CHD phenotypes in European Caucasians and identified 3 susceptibility loci (rs870142, rs16835979 and rs6824295) for ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) at chromosome 4p16. However, whether these loci at 4p16 confer the predisposition to CHD in Chinese population is unclear. In the current study, we first analyzed the associations between these 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 4p16 and CHD risk by using our existing genome-wide scan data and found all of the 3 SNPs showed significant associations with ASD in the same direction as that observed in Cordell's study, but not with other subtypes- ventricular septal defect (VSD) and ASD combined VSD. As these 3 SNPs were in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) in Chinese population, we selected one SNP with the lowest P value in our GWAS scan (rs16835979) to perform a replication study with additional 1,709 CHD cases with multiple phenotypes and 1,962 controls. The significant association was also observed only within the ASD subgroup, which was heterogeneous from other disease groups. In combined GWAS and replication samples, the minor allele of rs16835979 remained significant association with the risk of ASD (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.08-1.38, P = 0.001). Our findings suggest that susceptibility loci of ASD identified from Cordell's European GWAS are generalizable to Chinese population, and such investigation may provide new insights into the roles of genetic variants in the etiology of different CHD phenotypes."

25198518,25198518,A Newfound association between MDC1 functional polymorphism and lung cancer risk in Chinese.,"Mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 (MDC1) plays an early and core role in Double-Strand Break Repair (DDR) and ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) mediated response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and thus involves the pathogenesis of several DNA damage-related diseases such as cancer. We hypothesized that the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MDC1 which have potencies on affecting MDC1 expression or function were associated with risk of lung cancer. In a two-stage case-control study, we tested the association between 5 putatively functional SNPs of MDC1 and lung cancer risk in a southern Chinese population, and validated the promising association in an eastern Chinese population. We found the SNP rs4713354A>C that is located in the 5′-untranslated region of MDC1 was significantly associated with lung cancer risk in both populations (P = 0.001), with an odds ratio as 1.33(95% confidence interval = 1.14–1.55) for the rs4713354C (CA+CC) genotypes compared to the rs4713354AA genotype. The correct sixth sentence is: The gene-based analysis rested with these SNPs suggested the MDC1 as a susceptible gene for lung cancer (P = 0.057) [corrected]. Moreover, by querying the gene expression database, we further found that the rs4713354C genotypes confer a significantly lower mRNA expression of MDC1 than the rs4713354AA genotype in 260 cases of lymphoblastoid cells (P = 0.002). Our data suggested that the SNP rs4713354A>C of MDC1 may be a functional genetic biomarker for susceptibility to lung cancer in Chinese."
25190019,25190019,The genetic association between pri-miR-34b/c polymorphism (rs4938723 T > C) and susceptibility to cancers: evidence from published studies.,"Recently, several molecular epidemiological studies have focused on the association between pri-miR-34b/c rs4938723 SNP and the susceptibility to different cancers. Due to the controversial rather than conclusive results, we performed this meta-analysis to assess more precise and comprehensive conclusion about the association. Data published until July 2014 were collected from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, Chinese BioMedical Literature Database, and VIP database of Chinese Journal. Ultimately, 13 articles with a total of 7,753 cases and 8,014 controls were considered eligible for inclusion. The odds ratio (OR) and its 95 % confidence interval (95%CI) were used to assess the strength of association. In the overall analysis, a significant association between pri-miR-34b/c rs4938723 polymorphism and increased cancer susceptibility was found in heterozygous model (TC vs. TT: OR = 1.148, 95%CI 1.034-1.275, P = 0.010) and dominant model (CC + TC vs. TT: OR =1.166, 95%CI 1.028-1.322, P = 0.017). In subgroup analysis of ethnicity, pri-miR-34b/c rs4938723 polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased cancer susceptibility for Asian population in heterozygous model (TC vs. TT: OR = 1.169, 95%CI 1.031-1.326, P = 0.015) and dominant model (CC + TC vs. TT: OR = 1.185, 95%CI 1.017-1.382, P = 0.030), whereas no significant association for Caucasian population was observed in any genetic models. Intriguingly, stratified analysis revealed opposite results that pri-miR-34b/c polymorphism contributed to susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma while reduced susceptibility to colorectal cancer and esophageal squamous cell cancer in Asians. Considering some limitation of our meta-analysis, future well-designed case-control studies with larger sample sizes are required to confirm our findings."
25202455,25202455,"A Polymorphism in Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 Alpha, rs7310409, Is Associated with Left Main Coronary Artery Disease.","Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the world. Left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD) is a particularly severe phenotypic form of CAD and has a genetic basis. We hypothesized that some inflammation- and hyperhomocysteinemia-related gene polymorphisms may contribute to LMCAD susceptibility in a Chinese population. We studied the association between polymorphisms in the genes hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A; rs7310409, G/A), C-reactive protein (rs1800947 and rs3093059 T/C), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (rs1801133, C/T), and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (rs1076991, A/G) in 402 LMCAD and 804 more peripheral CAD patients in a Chinese population. Genotyping was performed using the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry method. When the HNF1A rs7310409 GG homozygote genotype was used as the reference group, both the individual, GA and AA, and combined GA/AA genotypes were associated with an increased risk of LMCAD. This single nucleotide polymorphism (rs7310409) is strongly associated with plasma CRP levels. In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that the HNF1A rs7310409 G/A functional polymorphism may contribute to the risk of LMCAD."

25170593,25170593,PGC-related gene variants and elite endurance athletic status in a Chinese cohort: a functional study.,"This study aims to examine the association between proliferator-activated receptor γ (PGC)-gene family-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and elite endurance runners' status in a Chinese cohort, and to gain insights into the functionality of a subset of SNPs. Genotype distributions of 133 SNPs in PPARGC1A, PPARGC1B, PPRC1, TFAM, TFB1M, TFB2M, NRF1, GABPA, GABPB1, ERRα, and SIRT1 genes were compared between 235 elite Chinese (Han) endurance runners (127 women) and 504 healthy non-athletic controls (237 women). Luciferase gene reporter activity was determined in 20 SNPs. After adjusting for multiple comparisons (in which threshold P-value was set at 0.00041), no significant differences were found in allele/genotype frequencies between athletes and controls (when both sexes were analyzed either together or separately). The lowest P-value was found in PPARGC1A rs4697425 (P = 0.001 for the comparison of allele frequencies between elite female endurance runners and their gender-matched controls). However, no association (all P > 0.05) was observed for this SNP in a replication cohort from Poland (194 endurance athletes and 190 controls). Using functional genomics tool, the following SNPs were found to have functional significance: PPARGC1A rs6821591, rs12650562, rs12374310, rs4697425, rs13113110, and rs4452416; PPARGC1B rs251466 and rs17110586; and PPRC1 rs17114388 (all P < 0.001). This study found no significant association between PGC-related SNPs and elite endurance athlete status in the Chinese population, despite some SNPs showing potential functional significance and the strong biological rationale to hypothesize that this gene pathway is a candidate to influence endurance exercise capacity."

25162123,25162123,MMP9 gene polymorphism is not associated with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy and neovascular age-related macular degeneration in a Chinese Han population.,"Recently, one of our studies has revealed that the serum matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) level is elevated in polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) but not in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Previous studies have demonstrated that abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AMD and PCV. MMP9 is an important regulating enzyme in ECM metabolism, and the MMP9 gene may be a candidate gene for the susceptibility of PCV and AMD. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the MMP9 gene polymorphism is associated with PCV and neovascular AMD (nAMD) in a Chinese Han population."
25192656,25192656,The GABRB1 gene is associated with thalamus volume and modulates the association between thalamus volume and intelligence.,"The GABRB1 gene encodes the beta 1 subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABA A receptor), which is responsible for mediating inhibitory neurotransmission in the thalamus. Potential relationships between the GABRB1 gene, thalamus volume, and intelligence have been suggested by previous clinical studies, but have not been directly examined among nonclinical samples. The current study collected structural MRI, genetic, and behavioral data from 316 healthy Chinese adults (including 187 females and 129 males), and examined associations between GABRB1 variants, thalamus volume, and intelligence (measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised). After controlling for intracranial volume, sex, and age, GABRB1 genetic polymorphism at the SNP rs7435958 had the strongest association with thalamus volume (p = 0.002 and 0.00008 for left and right thalamus volumes, respectively), with GG homozygotes having smaller bilateral thalamus volumes than the other genotypes. Furthermore, there were positive correlations between bilateral thalamus volumes and intelligence, especially for GABRB1 rs7435958 GG female homozygotes (r's = 0.31 and 0.29, p < 0.01, for the correlations of intelligence with left and right thalamus volumes, respectively). This study provides the first evidence for the involvement of the GABRB1 gene in the thalamus structure and their interactive effects on intelligence. Future studies of the thalamus-intelligence associations should consider genetic factors as potential moderators."
25155038,25155038,Correlation of CLPTM1L polymorphisms with lung cancer susceptibility and response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in a Chinese Han population.,"The implication of genetic factors in predisposition to cancer is a recognized fact. The Cleft lip and palate transmembrane 1-like (CLPTM1L) gene resides in a locus in the chromosome 5p15.33 region that is associated with lung cancer susceptibility and has a role in carcinogenesis. We conducted a case-control study in a Chinese population of 309 pathologically confirmed lung cancer patients and 310 controls to investigate the effect of variant genotypes within the CLPTM1L locus on susceptibility to lung cancer and sensitivity to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. We genotyped nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CLPTM1L locus and examined their correlation with lung cancer risk and treatment response using χ (2) and unconditional logistic regression analysis. We identified rs451360 as a novel SNP associated with lung cancer risk in the Chinese Han population. The ""T"" allele of rs451360 was associated with decreased risk of lung cancer (p = 0.007, odd ratio (OR) = 0.59, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.40-0.87). Significant multiplicative interactions were observed between gender and polymorphisms of rs402710, the ""T/T"" genotype of which was associated with decreased lung cancer risk in male patients (p = 0.016, OR = 0.35, 95 % CI: 0.17-0.73). CLPTM1L polymorphisms did not affect the tumor sensitivity to cisplatin combination chemotherapy in our study patients. The results of the present study suggest a potential association between CLPTM1L variants and lung cancer risk in the Chinese Han populations."

25154761,25154761,MicroRNA-146a rs2910164 polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to non-small cell lung cancer in the Chinese population.,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the microRNA-146a (miR-146a) genes with the risk of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The genotyping of miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The results showed that CC genotype and C allele distribution in the NSCLC patient were significantly higher than that of the controls (P=0.03 and 0.03, respectively). No significant differences were found between the two subgroups when stratified by clinical characteristics including age, sexual, smoke status, histological type, lymph node metastasis and clinical stage. In addition, the expression of miR-146a was detected by the Taqman real-time PCR. It demonstrated that the miR-146a expression was significantly decreased in NSCLC patients compared with that of nonmalignant lung tissues (P=0.01). In addition, the miR-146a expression of CC genotypes subgroup was significantly decreased than of GC/GG genotype subgroup in tumor tissues (P=0.0022). It confirmed that the SNP rs2910164 could functionally affect the miR-146a expression levels. In conclusion, it showed that the rs2910164 polymorphism of miR-146a is associated with the risk of NSCLC in the Chinese population."
25151233,25151233,A functional polymorphism affecting the APOA5 gene expression is causally associated with plasma triglyceride levels conferring coronary atherosclerosis risk in Han Chinese Population.,"Apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5) gene plays a key role in plasma triglyceride (TG) metabolism, and shows the involvement in coronary artery disease (CAD). A set of single nucleotide polymorphisms around the APOA5 gene was identified to be associated with plasma TG levels. It is of biological and clinical importance to discern the genuine genetic determinants. A polymorphism in 3' untranslated region of the APOA5 gene, rs2266788, is deserving of investigation for suggestive clues from the association in multiple independent studies. In this study, rs2266788 was genotyped in 3222 unrelated subjects consisting of 2062 CAD cases and 1160 controls. The statistical analyses indicated that the minor C allele of rs2266788 was significantly associated with elevated plasma TG levels and higher CAD risk. In normal human liver tissues, comparison of global APOA5 mRNA levels among genotypes and allelic expression imbalance analysis showed the decreased gene expression for the C allele. Luciferase assays confirmed a concordant result that transcriptional activity was lowered for the C allele compared with the T allele in four cell lines. Multiple lines of evidence in our study supported that rs2266788 was causally associated with plasma TG levels conferring CAD risk in Han Chinese population owing to a cis-acting effect to the APOA5 gene expression."
25152754,25152754,The Pro12Ala Polymorphism of PPAR-γ Gene Is Associated with Sepsis Disease Severity and Outcome in Chinese Han Population.,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) is a ligand-binding nuclear receptor, and its activation plays a prominent role in regulating the inflammatory response. Therefore, PPAR-γ has been suggested as a candidate gene for sepsis. In the present study, we investigated the association between the Pro12Ala polymorphism of PPAR-γ and sepsis in a Han Chinese population. A total of 308 patients with sepsis and 345 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Genotyping was performed using the polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR) method. No significant differences were detected in the allele and genotype distributions of the PPAR-γ Pro12Ala SNP between septic patients and controls (P = 0.622 for genotype; P = 0.629 for allele). However, stratification by subtypes (sepsis, septic shock, and severe sepsis) revealed a statistically significant difference in the frequency of the Ala allele and Ala-carrier genotype between the patients with the sepsis subtype and the healthy controls (P = 0.014 for allele and P = 0.012, for genotype). Moreover, significant differences were found in the frequency of the Ala allele and genotype between the sepsis survivors and nonsurvivors (all P = 0.002). In the survivors, the PPAR-γ Pro12Ala genotype was significantly associated with decreased disease severity and recovery time (all P < 0.001). Thus, genetic polymorphism is thought to play a role in the development and outcome of sepsis."

Although few studies have replicated this findings in other populations, but results are contradictory. So, we aimed to replicate association of two previously reported non-synonymous polymorphisms (rs2274223A>G and rs3765524C>T) from haplotype block 10 and evaluated a novel variant (rs7922612C>T) from haplotype block 2 of PLCE1 with susceptibility and prognosis of ESCC in northern Indian population. The genotyping of PLCE1 variants were performed in 293 histopathologically confirmed incident ESCC cases (including 177 follow-up cases) and 314 age-, gender-, and ethnicity-matched controls using PCR RFLP. All statistical analyses were performed through SPSS version 15.0. Modeling and functional prediction of two non-synonymous variants were carried out using bioinformatics tools. PLCE1 polymorphisms were not associated with susceptibility to ESCC or its clinical phenotypes (tumor location/lymph node metastasis). No interaction with environmental risk factors was found. In silico analysis suggested negligible effect on structure of PLCE1 protein due to PLCE1 rs2274223 (H1927R) and rs3765524 (T1777I) polymorphisms. Survival analysis showed PLCE1 rs7922612CT + TT genotype conferred adverse outcome to ESCC patients. Our study for the first time suggests that GWAS originated PLCE1 variants do not have independent role in susceptibility of ESCC in northern Indian population; however, a novel haplo-tagging SNP rs7922612 may modify survival outcome of ESCC patients."
25139529,25139529,rs11098403 polymorphism near NDST3 is associated with a reduced risk of schizophrenia in a Han Chinese population.,"A recent genome-wide association study indicated that rs11098403, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the vicinity of NDST3, was strongly associated with the risk of schizophrenia in Caucasians. However, this relation has not been validated in other populations or ethnic groups. Herein, we conducted a case-control study to investigate the association of rs11098403 polymorphism with the schizophrenia risk in a Han Chinese population comprising 440 schizophrenia patients and 450 control subjects. For the first time, we showed that the minor allele (G) of rs11098403 is closely associated with a reduced risk of schizophrenia (OR=0.614; 95% CI: 0.453-0.833; P=0.002; Power=0.832). Meanwhile, the G allele of rs11098403 seemed to reduce the schizophrenia risk via a dominant manner (GG+AG vs. AA, OR=0.526; 95% CI: 0.374-0.74; P<0.001). Furthermore, this association was further confirmed using an independent replication sample containing 267 schizophrenia patients and 400 control subjects with a Han Chinese descent (OR=0.652; 95% CI: 0.469-0.907; P=0.011; Power=0.772).

SNP rs2241766 was found significantly associated with T2D risk in the additive model, dominant model and recessive model. A marginal association was detected for SNP rs1501299 in the additive model and recessive model after Bonferroni correction, and haplotype analysis provided additional evidence supporting the association between these two SNPs and T2D risk.

25120811,25120811,Notch1 single nucleotide polymorphism rs3124591 is associated with the risk of development of invasive ductal breast carcinoma in a Chinese population.,"Accumulated evidence has revealed the presence of Notch receptor polymorphisms in non-tumorous diseases; however, few studies have investigated the association of Notch polymorphisms with breast cancer risk. A total of 100 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and 50 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) patients and 100 usual ductal hyperplasia (UDH) controls were genotyped for the following Notch receptor single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry: Notch1, rs3124591; Notch2, rs11249433; Notch3, rs3815188, and rs1043994; and Notch4, rs367398, and rs520692. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the effect of Notch polymorphisms on corresponding Notch protein expression in successfully genotyped patients. The frequency of rs3124591 TC genotype was significantly higher in IDC (24.7%, 20/81) and DCIS (30%, 12/40) patients than in UDH controls (8%, 8/97) (P = 0.002 and P = 0.011, respectively). However, the distribution of other SNP genotypes was not significantly different between IDC and DCIS patients and UDH controls. The frequency of TC genotype was significantly higher in poorly differentiated tumors than in well-differentiated and moderately differentiated tumors (P = 0.022). Importantly, a positive correlation between the rs3124591 TC genotype and high Notch1 protein expression was observed in DCIS patients (P = 0.043) but not in IDC patients. This is the first study to suggest an increased risk of IDC and DCIS of the breast for the Notch1 rs3124591 variant. Furthermore, given the inconsistent associations between the rs3124591 variant and Notch1 expression in IDC and DCIS, this variant may affect breast cancer risk through mechanisms in the latter stage other than alterations in Notch1 protein expression."
25120796,25120796,Sex-specific association of the peptidase D gene rs731839 polymorphism and serum lipid levels in the Mulao and Han populations.,"Little is known about the association of peptidase D (PEPD) gene rs731839 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and serum lipid profiles in the Chinese population. The objective of the present study was to detect the association of the PEPD rs731839 SNP and serum lipid levels in the Mulao and Han populations. Genotyping of the PEPD rs731839 SNP was performed in 751 subjects of Mulao and 762 subjects of Han using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism and then confirmed by direct sequencing. The A allele carriers had higher serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein (Apo) AI levels and lower triglyceride (TG) levels in Mulao; and higher HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and ApoAI levels in Han than the A allele non-carriers. Subgroup analyses showed that the A allele carriers had higher HDL-C, ApoAI levels and lower TG levels in Mulao males but not in females; higher total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, LDL-C and ApoAI levels in Han males; and higher TG, HDL-C and ApoAI levels in Han females than the A allele non-carriers. Serum lipid parameters were also correlated with several environmental factors in Mulao and Han populations, or in males and females in both ethnic groups. The association of the PEPD rs731839 SNP and serum lipid levels was different between the Mulao and Han populations, and between males and females in the both ethnic groups. There may be an ethnic- and/or sex-specific association of the PEPD rs731839 SNP and serum lipid levels in our study populations."
25122903,25122903,A heroin addiction severity-associated intronic single nucleotide polymorphism modulates alternative pre-mRNA splicing of the μ opioid receptor gene OPRM1 via hnRNPH interactions.,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the OPRM1 gene have been associated with vulnerability to opioid dependence. The current study identifies an association of an intronic SNP (rs9479757) with the severity of heroin addiction among Han-Chinese male heroin addicts. Individual SNP analysis and haplotype-based analysis with additional SNPs in the OPRM1 locus showed that mild heroin addiction was associated with the AG genotype, whereas severe heroin addiction was associated with the GG genotype. In vitro studies such as electrophoretic mobility shift assay, minigene, siRNA, and antisense morpholino oligonucleotide studies have identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (hnRNPH) as the major binding partner for the G-containing SNP site. The G-to-A transition weakens hnRNPH binding and facilitates exon 2 skipping, leading to altered expressions of OPRM1 splice-variant mRNAs and hMOR-1 proteins. Similar changes in splicing and hMOR-1 proteins were observed in human postmortem prefrontal cortex with the AG genotype of this SNP when compared with the GG genotype. Interestingly, the altered splicing led to an increase in hMOR-1 protein levels despite decreased hMOR-1 mRNA levels, which is likely contributed by a concurrent increase in single transmembrane domain variants that have a chaperone-like function on MOR-1 protein stability. Our studies delineate the role of this SNP as a modifier of OPRM1 alternative splicing via hnRNPH interactions, and suggest a functional link between an SNP-containing splicing modifier and the severity of heroin addiction."

25149646,25149646,Association of KIF21B genetic polymorphisms with ankylosing spondylitis in a Chinese Han population of Shandong Province.,"Previous studies have found that the kinesin family member (KIF) 21B may contribute to the autoimmune disease process. It has been reported that the KIF21B gene is relevant to the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). We hypothesized that KIF21B might be a key gene for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) development. To test this hypothesis, 11 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering KIF21B were investigated in 904 Chinese (Han ethnic) patients of Shandong Province with AS and 898 age- and sex-matched controls of the same ethnic origin. The T allele of rs756254 was linked to increased risk of AS (P = 0.022). The AA genotype of rs296560 and TT and AT genotypes of rs756254 were also relevant with AS (P = 0.044, P = 0.033, and P = 0.033, respectively). Haplotype analysis identified that the KIF21B gene region contains two haplotype blocks of eight and two SNPs, respectively. The haplotype GCGGTAAA in block 1 appeared to reduce the risk of AS (P = 0.005), while the haplotype AA in block 2 was significantly associated with an increased risk of AS (P = 0.039). There were no significant differences between the AS patients and the controls in polymorphisms of rs10920091, rs3198583, rs56368827, rs3738255, rs296565, rs12087649, rs12568529, rs7536000, and rs957957. These results indicated that KIF21B was associated with AS in a Chinese population of Shandong Province."
25129146,25129146,Joint analysis of three genome-wide association studies of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in Chinese populations.,"We conducted a joint (pooled) analysis of three genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in individuals of Chinese ancestry (5,337 ESCC cases and 5,787 controls) with 9,654 ESCC cases and 10,058 controls for follow-up. In a logistic regression model adjusted for age, sex, study and two eigenvectors, two new loci achieved genome-wide significance, marked by rs7447927 at 5q31.2 (per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.82-0.88; P = 7.72 × 10(-20)) and rs1642764 at 17p13.1 (per-allele OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.85-0.91; P = 3.10 × 10(-13)). rs7447927 is a synonymous SNP in TMEM173, and rs1642764 is an intronic SNP in ATP1B2, near TP53. Furthermore, a locus in the HLA class II region at 6p21.32 (rs35597309) achieved genome-wide significance in the two populations at highest risk for ESSC (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.22-1.46; P = 1.99 × 10(-10)).

25119828,25119828,The CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) polymorphism -2518A/G is associated with gout in the Chinese Han male population.,"Gout is usually characterized by uric acid-induced recurrent attacks of acute inflammatory arthritis. CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), a chemokine involved in the recruitment and migration of monocytes/macrophages, has previously been shown to be increased in the plasma of gout patients. In this study, we examined whether the CCL2 -2518A/G (rs1024611) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) affects susceptibility to gout in a Chinese Han male population. Genomic DNA from gout patients (n = 1,109) and ethnically matched gout-free controls (n = 1,034) was genotyped for the CCL2 -2518A/G SNP using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The Chi-square test was performed to investigate the association of genotypic and allelic frequencies between cases and controls, and the -2518G allele was shown to be associated with a significantly increased risk of gout development [P = 0.007, odds ratio 1.182, 95% confidence interval 1.047-1.335]. The GG genotypic distribution was also significantly different between cases and controls (adjusted P = 0.021). However, genotypic distributions and allelic frequencies did not indicate significant associations (P = 0.150 and P = 0.050, respectively) between tophi and non-tophi patients. Our findings support a key role for the CCL2 SNP -2518A/G in association with gout susceptibility in the Chinese Han male population. However, additional studies in other populations should be carried out to confirm this finding."

25101955,25101955,Analysis of interleukin-8 gene variants reveals their relative importance as genetic susceptibility factors for chronic periodontitis in the Han population.,"Interleukin (IL)-8, an important chemokine that regulates the inflammatory response, plays an important role in periodontitis. Previous studies indicate that certain IL-8 gene polymorphisms are associated with periodontitis susceptibility in some populations. However, the literature is somewhat contradictory, and not all IL-8 polymorphisms have been examined, particularly in Han Chinese individuals. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of every IL-8 SNP with chronic periodontitis in Han Chinese individuals. We analyzed 23 SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF)≥0.01, which were selected from 219 SNPs in the NCBI dbSNP and preliminary HapMap data analyses from a cohort of 400 cases and 750 controls from genetically independent Han Chinese individuals. Single SNP, haplotype and gender-specific associations were performed. We found that rs4073 and rs2227307 were significantly associated with chronic periodontitis. Further haplotype analysis indicated that a haplotype block (rs4073-rs2227307-rs2227306) that spans the promoter and exon1 of IL-8 was highly associated with chronic periodontitis. Additionally, the ATC haplotype in this block was increased 1.5-fold in these cases. However, when analyzing the samples by gender, no significant gender-specific associations in IL-8 were observed, similar to the results of haplotype association analyses in female and male subgroups. Our results provide further evidence that IL-8 is associated with chronic periodontitis in Han Chinese individuals. Furthermore, our results confirm previous reports suggesting the intriguing possibilities that IL-8 plays a role in the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis and that this gene may be involved in the etiology of this condition."

25091576,25091576,The Axin2 rs2240308 polymorphism and susceptibility to lung cancer in a Chinese population.,"Axis inhibition protein 2 (Axin2) is a negative regulator of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and functions as a tumor suppressor in a number of human cancers. Previous pilot studies have suggested an association between Axin2 exon1 148 (rs2240308) SNP polymorphism and risk for lung cancer. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the Axin2 exon1 148 polymorphism and its association with lung cancer susceptibility in Han Chinese population. The Axin2 exon1 148 SNP was genotyped in 555 controls and 520 lung cancer patients using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We observed that the genotype frequencies of TC, TT, and CC were significantly different between controls and cases (χ(2) = 6.849, P = 0.03256, df = 2). Subjects carrying T allele (TC + TT genotypes) had decreased susceptibility to lung cancer as compared to those carrying CC genotype (OR = 0.733, 95% CI = 0.5726-0.9393, P = 0.01382). No significant association was found between rs2240308 polymorphism and histological subtypes of lung cancers. Findings from this study suggest that Axin2 exon1 T148C polymorphism (rs2240308) contributes to increased susceptibility to lung cancer in Chinese population. This further implicates Axin2 as a lung cancer-related gene."

25110886,25110886,The effects of genetic variation in FTO rs9939609 on obesity and dietary preferences in Chinese Han children and adolescents.,"The association of the rs9939609 single nucleotide polymorphism in FTO gene with obesity has been extensively investigated in studies of populations of European, African, and Asian ancestry. However, inconsistent results have been reported in Asian populations, and the relationship of FTO variation and dietary behaviors has only rarely been examined in Chinese children and adolescents. The aim of this study was to assess the association of rs9939609 with obesity and dietary preferences in childhood in a Chinese population. Epidemiological data including dietary preferences were collected in interviews using survey questionnaires, and rs9939609 genotype was determined by real-time PCR. The associations of rs9939609 genotypes with obesity and dietary preferences were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression using both additive and dominant models. The results showed that subjects with a TA or AA genotype had an increased risk of obesity compared with the TT participants; the odds ratios (ORs) were 1.47 (95% CI: 1.25-1.71, P = 1.73×10-6), and 3.32 (95% CI: 2.01-5.47, P = 2.68×10-6), respectively. After adjusting for age and gender, body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were higher, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower in TA and AA participants than in those with the TT genotype. After additionally controlling for body mass index, the association remained significant only for systolic blood pressure (P = 0.005). Compared with TT participants, those with the AA genotype were more likely to prefer a meat-based diet (OR = 2.81, 95% CI: 1.52-5.21). The combined OR for obesity in participants with TA/AA genotypes and preference for a meat-based diet was 4.04 (95% CI: 2.8-5.81) compared with the TT participants who preferred a plant-based diet. These findings indicate the genetic variation of rs9939609 is associated with obesity and dietary preferences in Chinese children and adolescents."

25073439,25073439,IFRD1 polymorphisms and gastric cancer risk in a Chinese population.,"The association between gene polymorphisms of IFRD1 and gastric cancer is not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between IFRD1 polymorphisms and gastric cancer in Chinese population. Fifty-three consecutive patients with the diagnosis of gastric cancer were defined as the case group, and another 50 healthy donors were denoted as the control group. About 4 ml of peripheral blood was collected from each donor for extracting DNA. Finally, IFRD1 rs7818, rs3807213, and rs6968084 SNPs were detected with polymerase chain reaction. C/C genotype distribution frequencies of rs6968084 and rs7817 in gastric cancer patients were similar with the controls (OR 0.192, 95 % CI 0.513-2.769, P = 0.683 and OR 2.075, 95 % CI 0.744-5.792, P = 0.16, respectively). Patients with gastric cancer had a significantly higher frequency of rs3807213 C allele and rs3807213 C/C genotype than controls. (OR 4.028, 95 % CI 1.513-10.72, P = 0.004) (OR 3.759, 95 % CI 1.521-9.294, P = 0.003). This study suggests that the SNPs of IFRD1 rs7818 and rs6968084 have nothing to do with the gastric cancer susceptibility. The allele gene C and genotype C/C of rs3807213 SNP are involved in susceptibility to gastric cancer, but there were no relations when subgroup stratified all the three SNPs according to pathological stages."
25049867,25049867,Effects of CSN1S2 Genotypes on Economic Traits in Chinese Dairy Goats.,"The aim of this study was to investigate allele frequencies at the CSN1S2 locus in two Chinese dairy goat breeds and the effects of its variation on dairy goat economic traits. Seven hundred and eight goats from Xinong Saanen (XS, n = 268) and Guanzhong (GZ, N = 440) breeds were selected. The milk samples of 268 XS goats were collected during the middle of lactation, body size parameters (708 goats) and daily milk yield (202 goats) were registered. The RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) and SSCP (single strand conformation polymorphism) were used to detect the polymorphisms in CSN1S2. The Hardy-Weinberg (HW) equilibrium and the associations between body size, milk yield and composition and the genotypes were calculated. The results revealed that only A and F CSN1S2 alleles were found in the two Chinese dairy goat breeds. Allelic frequencies of A and F were 0.795, 0.205 and 0.739, 0.261 in Xinong Saanen and Guanzhong population respectively. Xinong Saanen breed was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, while Guanzhong breed deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p<0.05). The association of polymorphism with economic traits indicated that the goats with FF genotype have higher milk fat and total solid concentration than those with AA and AF genotypes (p<0.05)."

The aim of this study was to estimate the distributions of TLR7 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs179019 and rs3853839, as well as the effect of TLR7 gene variants on TLR7 mRNA expression and cytokine production in response to TLR7 agonist in vitro. TLR7 SNP genotyping was performed among a Chinese sample population of 418 patients with persistent HCV infection, 317 patients with HCV spontaneous clearance, and 989 healthy controls. TLR7 mRNA expression and TLR7-specific IFN-α and IL-6 secretion in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, derived from 60 healthy individuals in vitro, were then quantified. We identified the association of TLR7 rs3853839C allele, haplotype CC and haplotype AC (rs179019/rs3853839) with protection against HCV persistence in Chinese females (OR=0.49, 95% CI=0.29-0.81, P=0.01 for rs3853839 GC; OR=0.29, 95% CI=0.11-0.75, P=0.01 for rs3853839 CC; OR=0.51, 95% CI=0.38-0.77, P<0.01 for haplotype CC; OR=0.29, 95% CI=0.10-0.88, P=0.03 for haplotype AC). In addition, the rs3853839 CC genotype among female carriers had significantly low TLR7 mRNA expression (P=0.006 for GG vs. CC, P=0.021 for GC vs. CC), along with decreased IFN-α (P=0.002 for GG vs. CC, P=0.021 for GC vs. CC) and increased antiviral IL-6 production (P=0.002 for GG vs. CC, P=0.030 for GC vs. CC), after treatment with Imiquimod in vitro. The cytokine profile among rs3853839 CC genotype female carriers may indicate a pronounced protective effect against persistent HCV infection. The functional polymorphism of TLR7 rs3853839C allele was found to be sex-specific and associated with protection against HCV persistence among Chinese females, which may be due to specific IFN-α and IL-6 secretion profiles."

Correlation analysis was performed in a case-control study involving 100 AS cases and 100 healthy controls. The nt587 single nucleotide polymorphism of the TNFRII gene was examined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The relationship between AS and the frequencies of genotypes and alleles in TNFRII nt587 were analyzed using the SPSS software. There were 43 cases with the TNFRII nt587 T/T genotype, 32 cases with the TNFRII nt587 T/G genotype, and 25 cases with the TNFRII nt587 G/G genotype. In the 100 healthy controls, 56 subjects had the TNFRII nt587 T/T genotype, 34 had the TNFRII nt587 T/G genotype, and 10 had the TNFRII nt587 G/G genotype. The G allele frequency of the AS group was significantly higher (χ(2) = 8.734, P = 0.003) than that in the control group (41.0 vs 27.0%). The odds ratio (OR) in AS cases with the TNFRII nt587 G/G genotype was 3.256, which was obviously higher than in those with T/G (OR = 1.226) and T/T (OR = 1.0) genotype. The polymorphism at position nt587 of the TNFRII gene was found to be associated with AS, and the TNFRII nt587 G allele may play an important role in AS susceptibility. The TNFRII nt587 G/G genotype may increase the risk of developing AS in the Hunan population."

25050807,25050807,HMGB1 gene polymorphism is associated with hypertension in Han Chinese population.,"High-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) acts as a proinflammatory cytokine by activating pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the receptor of AGE (AGER) with oxidative injury. Animal study proved that HMGB1 contributed to the pathogenesis of experimental pulmonary hypertension (HT) via activation of TLR4. The aim of this study is to test whether HMGB1 harbor genetic susceptibility to HT in a Chinese population."
25024040,25024040,Polymorphism of DEFA in Chinese Han population with IgA nephropathy.,"Our recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) had discovered a new locus at 8p23 (rs2738048) associated with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in Chinese Han patients, implicating the DEFA gene family within this locus as susceptibility genes. However, it is still unknown whether there are additional variations within these genes associated with the disease susceptibility. The aim of this study is to investigate the polymorphisms of DEFA genes in the susceptibility to IgAN and explore possible disease mechanisms. Sixteen tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tag SNPs) were selected for association study in 1,000 IgAN cases and 1,000 controls by using Sequenom MassArray system or TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. We found seven SNPs within DEFA genes that were significantly associated with IgAN, including rs2738048 discovered in our previous GWAS (p = 0.0007, OR = 0.77) and additional 6 SNPs (rs2615787, p = 0.0001, OR = 0.74; rs2738081, p = 0.0003, OR = 0.72; rs2738058, p = 0.0001, OR = 0.73; rs4288398, p = 0.0008, OR = 0.78; rs6984215, p = 0.002, OR = 0.63; rs12716641, p = 0.00002, OR = 0.71). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and luciferase assays demonstrated that fragments containing rs2738048, rs2738081 and rs6984215 were transcription factor binding sites for CTF, SP1 and CdxA, respectively, and the allele status of rs2738048 and rs6984215 could significantly change the luciferase activity. These results suggest that polymorphisms within DEFA genes are involved in gene transcriptional regulation, and this may have some effect in mediating susceptibility to IgAN in southern Chinese."
25010264,25010264,Association of the gene polymorphisms in sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide with the outcomes of hepatitis B infection in Chinese Han population.,"In recent years, sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) was newly identified as a hepatitis B virus (HBV) receptor, which partly shed light on the reason for HBV hepatotropism and its host specificity. However, the related researches were limited to in vitro or animal experiments. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association of NTCP polymorphisms with HBV natural course in humans."
25022354,25022354,Common variations in BMP4 confer genetic susceptibility to sporadic congenital heart disease in a Han Chinese population.,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect in humans. The genetic causes of sporadic CHD remain largely unknown. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family, is required for normal heart development. Loss of BMP4 gene expression in mice is associated with septal defects, defective endocardial cushion remodeling, and abnormal semilunar valve formation. This study evaluated the contribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BMP4 to CHD susceptibility in a case-control study of 575 patients with CHD and 844 non-CHD control subjects in a Chinese population. The BMP4 SNP rs762642 was associated with CHD in an additive model (odds ratio [OR]add 1.22; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.43; P add = 0.02). Stratified analysis by CHD subtypes showed a significant association only between rs762642 and atrial septal defect (ORadd 1.33; 95 % CI 1.04-1.72; P add = 0.03) in the additive model. This study was the first to indicate that a common variant of BMP4 may contribute to susceptibility to sporadic CHD in a Chinese population."
25007960,25007960,Association study of susceptibility loci with specific breast cancer subtypes in Chinese women.,"To determine whether recent genome-wide association studies that reported 45 susceptibility loci in European women are also risk factors for breast cancer in Chinese women. We selected and genotyped 40 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the Sequenom iPlex platform in a female Chinese cohort of 2,901 breast cancer cases and 2,789 healthy controls. We evaluated these SNPs with the risk of breast cancer and further by estrogen receptor (ER) status, progestin (PR) status, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) status, and four breast cancer subtypes (Luminal A type, Luminal B type, HER-2 overexpression type and Basal-like type). We first confirmed that the SNP rs9693444 on 8p12 was associated with breast cancer in Chinese women (P = 6.44 × 10(-4)). Furthermore, we identified four susceptibility loci that were associated with specific tumor subtypes. Statistically significant differences were detected with the association of rs6828523 (4q34.1/ADAM29) with ER-positive breast cancer (P = 1.27 × 10(-3)) and the association of rs4849887 (2q14.2) with PR-positive breast cancer (P = 1.29 × 10(-3)). Of the four breast cancer subtypes, the associations of rs12493607 (3p24.1/TGFBR2) with HER-2 overexpression in breast cancer (P = 1.09 × 10(-3)) and rs11075995 (16q12.2/FTO) with basal-like breast cancer (P = 1.64 × 10(-4)) were statistically significant. This study is the first to show that these 5 susceptibility loci (8p12, 4q34.1/ADAM29, 2q14.2, 3p24.1/TGFBR2, and 16q12.2/FTO) correlate with breast cancer (overall and specific subtypes) in Chinese women, which has improved our understanding of the genetic basis of specific breast cancer subtypes."
25014617,25014617,TPH2 genotype is associated with PTSD's avoidance symptoms in Chinese female earthquake survivors.,"Genetic factors are important in the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following exposure to traumatic events. However, the molecular genetic underpinnings of this disorder have not been definitive. This study examined the association between tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) rs11178997 genotype, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the transcriptional control region, and PTSD symptoms. A total of 326 Chinese adults who suffered from the deadly 2008 Wenchuan earthquake and lost their children during the disaster participated in this study. PTSD symptoms were measured with PTSD checklist, and the SNP was successfully genotyped by the MassARRAY system. The results indicated that, although the rs11178997 genotype was not associated with total PTSD symptoms, it could significantly predict severity of PTSD's avoidance symptoms in women. These findings support that TPH2 may play an important functional role in the development of PTSD and contribute to the limited literature regarding the genetic basis and the sex-specific expression of PTSD's symptoms."
25028161,25028161,"Polymorphisms in TLR1, TLR6 and TLR10 genes and the risk of Graves' disease.","Graves' disease (GD) is postulated to be caused by the combined effects of susceptibility genes and environmental triggers. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a role in the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses in mammalians. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential association of polymorphisms in TLR1, TLR6 and TLR10 genes with GD in Chinese Cantonese population. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (i.e. rs4833095 and rs5743565 in TLR1; rs5743808 in TLR6; and rs4504265, rs11466655, rs11096957 and rs10856839 in TLR10) were evaluated in 332 GD patients and 351 unrelated controls from Chinese Cantonese population. SNP rs5743565 in TLR1 conferred a protective effect against GD. The minor allele G of rs5743565 decreased the risk of GD in all cases (odds ratio; ORG vs. A=0.72 (0.58-0.91); p=0.005; ptrend=0.004) and early onset patients (ORG vs. A=0.72 (0.56-0.91); p=0.007; ptrend=0.006). This study provided evidence that genetic variation rs5743565 in TLR1 might be associated with the decreased susceptibility of GD."

24978901,24978901,Association between SNP rs13376333 and rs1131820 in the KCNN3 gene and atrial fibrillation in the Chinese Han population.,"The small conductance calcium-activated potassium, subfamily N, member 3 (KCNN3) gene rs13376333 and rs1131820 have been shown to be strongly associated with lone atrial fibrillation (AF), while replication association studies between rs13376333 in KCNN3 gene and risk of AF showed conflicting results. The current study tried to validate the impact of SNP rs13376333 and rs1131820 of KCNN3 gene on the risk of AF in the Chinese Han population."
24997981,24997981,Association study between interleukin-12 receptor β1/β2 genes and allergic rhinitis in the Chinese Han population.,"Interleukin-12 (IL-12) plays a key role in the protection against allergic reaction induced by allergen as well as the differentiation of T helper 1 cells in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR), exerting its biological effects through binding to specific IL-12 receptors (IL-12Rs) termed IL-12Rβ1 and IL-12Rβ2. In this study, we investigated the relationship between polymorphisms in the IL-12R gene and AR in the Chinese Han population. A total of 543 patients with AR and 749 normal controls were genotyped for IL-12Rβ1/rs438421, IL-12Rβ2/rs3790565, rs3790567, and rs6679356 using a PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The association study of each polymorphism of the IL-12Rβ1 and IL-12Rβ2 gene and AR showed that a significantly increased prevalence of the homozygous rs438421 GG genotype and G allele appeared in the AR patients compared with healthy controls. A significantly decreased prevalence of AG in rs438421 in AR patients is compared with healthy controls. Our research demonstrated an important association between polymorphisms in IL-12Rβ1 and AR in the Chinese Han population. A strong association between rs438421 in a single nucleotide polymorphism of IL-12Rβ1 and AR was identified."
24999832,24999832,Integrative approach detected association between genetic variants of microRNA binding sites of TLRs pathway genes and OSCC susceptibility in Chinese Han population.,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a leading malignancy worldwide; the overall 5-year survival rate is approximately 50%. A variety of proteins in Toll-like receptors (TLRs) pathway have been related with the risk of OSCC. However, the influence of genetic variations in TLRs pathway genes on OSCC susceptibility is unclear. Previous studies mainly focused on the coding region of genes, while the UTR region remains unstudied. In the current study, a bioinformatics approach was performed to select candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on microRNA binding sites of TLRs pathway genes related with OSCC. After screening 90 OSCC related TLRs pathway genes, 16 SNPs were selected for genotyping. We found that rs5030486, the polymorphisms on 3' UTR of TRAF6, was significantly associated with OSCC risk. AG genotype of TRAF6 was strongly associated with a decreased risk of OSCC (OR = 0.252; 95% CI = 0.106, 0.598; p = 0.001). In addition, AG genotype was also related with a reduced risk of OSCC progression both in univariable analysis (HR = 0.303, 95% CI = 0.092, 0.995) and multivariable analysis (HR = 0.272, 95% CI = 0.082, 0.903). Furthermore, after detecting the mRNA expression level of TRAF6 in 24 OSCC patients, we found that TRAF6 expression level was significantly different between patients carrying different genotypes at locus rs5030486 (p = 0.013), indicating that rs5030486 of TRAF6 might contribute to OSCC risk by altering TRAF6 expression level. In general, these data indicated that SNP rs5030486 could be a potential bio-marker for OSCC risk and our results might provide new insights into the association of polymorphisms within the non-coding area of genes with cancers."

24972815,24972815,"Association study of single nucleotide polymorphisms of MAFB with non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate in a population in Heilongjiang Province, northern China.","Non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCLP) is a common complex birth defect. MAFB (v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog B) is a new gene that may be involved in susceptibility to cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P). To further assess its role in NSCLP, we investigated 3 identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in MAFB (rs13041247, rs6065259, and rs11696257) and examined them for association with NSCLP in 344 patients and 324 healthy controls in a northern Chinese Han population with a high incidence of the syndrome. Peripheral blood samples were taken when patients enrolled in the study and DNA samples were extracted from the blood. The 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped using a mini-sequencing method (Snapshot(®) Multiplex System for SNP genotyping, Life Technologies Ltd, Paisley, UK). We found that rs6065259 was the most important single nucleotide polymorphism in MAFB (OR6065259-AA=0.45; 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.71; p=0.0027), followed by rs13041247; however, no association was found between rs11696257 and NSCLP. Our study provides further evidence regarding the role of MAFB variations in the development of NSCLP in this northern Chinese Han population."
26835343,26835343,Association of folate metabolism genes MTHFR and MTRR with multiple complex congenital malformation risk in Chinese population of Shanxi.,"Birth defects are common, serious malformations with a complex etiology that suggests involvement of both genetic and environmental factors. Low dietary folate and polymorphisms in genes of folate metabolism can influence risk for birth defects. In the present study 250 Chinese birth defects cases who suffered 1-8 types of birth defect disease phenotypes were subjected and two genetic variants in two folate metabolism key enzymes, rs1801394 of methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) and rs1801133 of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) were genotyped by using SNaPshot method. The results indicated that rs1801394 and rs1801133 were associated with multiple birth defects. According to homology of organogenesis, the disease phenotypes were classified into ectoderm-, mesoderm-, and endoderm-developed groups. Genetic analysis results displayed that as protective factors, genetic variants of rs1801133 and rs1801394 were associated with the risk of ectoderm-, and endoderm-developed malformations, but only the variant of rs1801394 was associated with the risk of mesoderm-developed malformations. Our present study first related nutrition metabolism related gene variants to germ layers and provided a novel understanding of an implication of earlier causation of birth defects pathogenesis in humans."
25019275,25019275,Lack of association of a genetic variant in the long intergenic noncoding RNA (linc01080) with Alzheimer's disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment in Han Chinese.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that is the most common form of dementia in the elderly and is characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive dysfunction. Although the pathogenetic mechanism of AD is still unknown, genetic variants play a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD. Increasing evidence has suggested that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) may be associated with the development of AD. A previous study analyzing human single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) at the genome level indicated that a genetic variant, rs7990916, in the lincRNA 01080 (linc01080) may play an important role in the physiology and pathophysiology of the human brain. To determine whether this SNP alters the risk for sporadic AD (SAD) or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) susceptibility, we conducted a case-control study in a Han Chinese population with 106 SAD patients, 67 aMCI patients, and 179 healthy controls. Using the LDR-PCR genotyping method, we found no significant difference in allele or genotype frequency in the SNP rs7990916 between patients and controls (p > 0.05). Our results do not support previous findings, suggesting that further studies by using large-scale association analyses are warranted in Han Chinese populations."
24972756,24972756,Resequencing and association study of the NFKB activating protein-like gene (NKAPL) in schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a highly inheritable disorder, but many aspects of its etiology and pathophysiology remain poorly understood.

24988941,24988941,Genome-wide association study for pigmentation traits in Chinese Holstein population.,"With the Illumina BovineSNP50K BeadChip, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for two pigmentation traits in a Chinese Holstein population: proportion of black (PB) and teat colour (TC). A case-control design was used. Cases were the cows with PB <0.30 (n = 129) and TC <2 points (n = 140); controls were those with PB >0.90 (n = 58) and TC >4 points (n = 281). The RM test of roadtrips (version 1.2) was applied to detect SNPs for the two traits with 42 883 and 42 741 SNPs respectively. A total of nine and 12 genome-wide significant (P < 0.05) SNPs associated with PB and TC respectively were identified. Of these, two SNPs for PB were located within the KIT and IGFBP7 genes, and the other four SNPs were 23~212 kb away from the PDGFRA gene on BTA6; nine SNPs associated with TC were located within or 21~78.8 kb away from known genes on chromosomes 4, 11, 22, 23 and 24. By combing through our GWAS results and the biological functions of the genes, we suggest that the KIT, IGFBP7, PDGFRA, MITF, ING3 and WNT16 genes are promising candidates for PB and TC in Holstein cattle, providing a basis for further investigation on the genetic mechanism of pigmentation formation."
24960033,24960033,Association of innate immune IFIH1 gene polymorphisms with dilated cardiomyopathy in a Chinese population.,"The interferon-induced helicase C domain-containing protein 1 (IFIH1) is a cytosolic RNA sensor belonging to the pattern-recognition receptor (PPR) family. Activation of PPRs on innate immune cells is widely believed to control the development of virus-induced autoimmunity in myocarditis and subsequent dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We conducted a pilot study to test whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IFIH1 were associated with the risk and prognosis of DCM. The TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay was used to genotype rs1990760 and rs3747517 in 351 DCM patients and 359 controls. The frequency of T allele and CT/TT genotypes at rs1990760 were significantly increased in DCM patients compared to control subjects (p = 0.046 and p = 0.027, respectively). The CC homozygosity was associated with worse prognosis expressed by the endpoint of cardiac death compared with allele T carriers of rs3747517 in both univariable (p = 0.04) and multivariable survival analysis after adjusting for age, sex, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and ejection fraction (p = 0.01). The results revealed that rs1990760 was associated with susceptibility to DCM and rs3747517 played a role in the prognostic assessment of DCM, reflecting the distinct genetic contributions of innate IFIH1 polymorphisms in controlling the onset and outcome of DCM."
24957471,24957471,C392T polymorphism of the Wnt10a gene in non-syndromic oral cleft in a northeastern Chinese population.,"Non-syndromic oral cleft is one of the most common congenital malformations, and more than 40 genes may be involved in its aetiology. Recent studies have shown that the Wnt10a gene may also contribute. We recruited 198 patients with non-syndromic oral clefts, comprising 96 elementary families (restricted to the patients and their parents) and 187 controls, to investigate their associations with the risk of such clefts and their subgroups in a Chinese Han population. The variant evaluated in this study was a single nucleotide polymorphism - specifically, a missense mutation C392T of Wnt10a. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was used to genotype the marker, and case-control and family-based associations were analysed. Although in the case-control study there were no significant differences in frequency distributions of genotypes or alleles between cases and controls in the groups with cleft palate and cleft lip and palate, the genotypic and allelic frequencies of C392T in the total groups and the group with cleft lip alone differed significantly from those in the controls (p=0.04, and 0.01, respectively). A transmission disequilibrium test showed a transmitted disequilibrium in C392T. In conclusion, we found an association between the C392T variant and non-syndromic oral clefts."

The purpose of this study was to examine the association between genetic variants in IGFBP-3 (rs2270628) and the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in a Chinese Han population. Five hundred ESCC cases and 500 cancer-free controls of the Chinese Han population were involved in this study. The IGFBP-3 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2270628 was genotyped and the estimated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for its association with the risk of ESCC were determined using unconditional logistic regression analysis. Compared with the rs2270628 CC genotype, TT genotype was associated with a significantly increased ESCC risk with OR (95%CI) of 2.07 (1.05-4.09), but CT genotype was not (OR = 1.25, 95%CI =0.94-1.66). IGFBP-3 SNP rs2270628 may contribute to the risk of ESCC in the Chinese Han population."
24947064,24947064,Family-based analysis of INSR polymorphisms in Chinese PCOS.,"The insulin receptor (INSR), which is an indispensable component of the insulin-signalling pathway, could be a plausible candidate gene for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This study was designed to determine whether an association exists between three SNP variants (rs3786681, rs17253937 and rs2252673) of the INSR gene and PCOS in Han Chinese. A total of 224 family trios (672 participants in total) were enrolled in this family-based transmission disequilibrium test. Genotypes were obtained by sequencing. A weak association was detected in rs2252673 (P = 0.027), which indicated that INSR may confer an increased susceptibility to PCOS in Chinese. Additionally, the association between INSR gene variants and clinical and metabolic characteristics of women with PCOS was investigated. Carriers of the CG and GG genotypes in women with PCOS were slightly associated with higher cholesterol concentration (t = 2.072, P = 0.048) and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration (t = 2.274, P = 0.026). The minor allele conferred increased odds of PCOS independently of body mass index. The present data may provide a basis for further studies of the role of the INSR in the aetiology of PCOS."
24938467,24938467,Genetic variants of the endothelial NO synthase gene (eNOS) may confer increased risk of sporadic congenital heart disease.,"The endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) enzyme is expressed during the early stages of cardiogenesis and plays an important role in normal heart development. Genetic variations of eNOS G894T have been shown to influence individual susceptibility to some phenotypes of congenital heart disease (CHD) in different populations. We conducted a case-control study comprised of 945 CHD patients and 972 non-CHD individuals in a Chinese population. Two functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (T-786C: rs2070744 and G894T: rs1799983) and one tagging SNP (rs7830) were evaluated in our study, and we assessed their association with the risk of CHD. Compared with the rs7830 CC/AC genotypes, the eNOS rs7830 AA genotype showed a significantly increased risk of CHD (adjusted odds radio (OR) = 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI = 1.13-1.85). A stratified analysis was performed and showed that the association between the rs7830 AA genotype and CHD risk was stronger in patients with perimembranous ventricular septal defects (adjusted OR = 1.62, 95%CI = 1.20-2.20). Our results suggest that the eNOS rs7830 polymorphism may contribute to the susceptibility of sporadic CHD in a Chinese population."
24932589,24932589,Variant rs1906591 on chromosome 4q25 confers increased risk of cardioembolic stroke in Chinese patients.,"Ischemic stroke (IS) is a heterogeneous multifactorial disorder caused by both genetic and environmental factors. A genome-wide association study on stroke in Caucasians identified a variant on chromosome 4q25 that is significantly associated with IS, with the strongest risk for cardioembolic stroke (CES). The current study aims to investigate the association of the rs1906591 variant on 4q25 with IS through a case-control study in a Chinese Han population. A total of 712 IS patients and 774 control subjects were involved in the current research. Stroke subtyping was performed according to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment criteria. The genotypes were determined using the SNaPshot technique. The association of the genotypes with the risk of IS was estimated using logistic regression analysis. The rs1906591 single nucleotide polymorphism variant was associated with the CES subtype in both recessive and additive models (recessive model: odds ratio [OR]=2.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.47-4.53, p=0.001, adjusted OR=2.71, 95% CI 1.48-4.96, p=0.001; additive model: OR=2.50, 95% CI 1.19-5.25, p=0.015, adjusted OR=2.83, 95% CI 1.24-6.50, p=0.013). This result indicates that patients with the AA genotype have a higher rate of CES than other genotypes. However, the rs1906591 variant was not significantly associated with the overall incidence of stroke or other stroke subtypes. The rs1906591 variant is significantly associated with CES in the Chinese Han population, but not with other stroke subtypes."

The objective of this study was to assess the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of OGG1 gene and risk of pancreatic cancer. A case-control study has been conducted in 370 pancreatic cancer patients and 395 healthy controls. Genotypes were determined using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing methods. The association analysis was evaluated by the unconditional logistic regression test. Our data suggested that the distributions of alleles and genotypes were statistically different between pancreatic cancer patients and healthy controls. The c.307G>C SNP was associated with the decreased risk of pancreatic cancer (C vs. G: OR 0.73, 95 % CI 0.59-0.91, P = 0.006). As for c.828A>G SNP, the significantly decreased risk of pancreatic cancer was detected (G vs. A: OR 0.74, 95 % CI 0.59-0.92, P = 0.006). The allele C of c.307G>C and allele G of c.828A>G SNPs might be associated with a protection from pancreatic cancer. Findings from this study indicate that OGG1 SNPs are associated with pancreatic cancer risk in Chinese Han population and could be useful molecular biomarkers for assessing the risk of pancreatic cancer."

24897540,24897540,CD86 +1057G/A polymorphism and risk of chronic immune thrombocytopenia.,"The G to A transition at position +1057 single nucleotide polymorphism site in CD86 gene results in the alanine to threonine substitution, which further affects the antigen-presenting cells' signal transduction. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the association between CD86 +1057G/A polymorphism and the risk for chronic immune thrombocytopenia (cITP). The CD86 +1057G/A polymorphism in 158 cITP patients and 150 healthy controls were detected by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism and then confirmed by DNA sequencing. In the patients with cITP, the frequencies of GG, AG and AA genotypes and G and A alleles were 18.4%, 58.8%, 22.8%, 47.8% and 52.2%, respectively. No difference in genotype and allele frequencies was detected in total cITP patients and normal controls (p = 0.913 and 0.845, respectively). Cases were subsequently classified by age at diagnosis, gender or clinical responses to glucocorticoids, and still no obvious discrepancy of genotype and allele frequencies was found between each of the groups and normal controls. In conclusion, this study suggests that CD86 +1057G/A polymorphism may be not associated with the genetic susceptibility to cITP in a Chinese population."
24903966,24903966,The association between sex-related interleukin-6 gene polymorphisms and the risk for cerebral palsy.,"The relationship between genetic factors and the development of cerebral palsy (CP) has recently attracted much attention. Polymorphisms in the genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines have been shown to be associated with susceptibility to perinatal brain injury and development of CP. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a pivotal role in neonatal brain injury, but conflicting results have been reported regarding the association between IL-6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and CP. The purpose of this study was to analyze IL-6 gene polymorphisms and protein expression and to explore the role of IL-6 in the Chinese CP population."
24894103,24894103,Serum C-reactive protein level but not its gene polymorphism is associated with Takayasu arteritis.,"Takayasu arteritis (TA) patients with active disease often have elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, which usually decline with the disease remission. The serum CRP concentration has been showed to be related to CRP gene polymorphisms in previous studies. The present study aims to investigate the associations of serum level of CRP and CRP polymorphisms with TA. A total of 178 unrelated Chinese Han TA patients and 229 unrelated Chinese Han individuals without documented disease were enrolled in our studies. After a systemic search in the HapMap database, four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected, namely, rs1800947, rs3093077, rs1205, and rs2808630. The ligase detection reaction (LDR) was used in genotyping. CRP concentrations were determined using turbidimetric immunoassay. Genotype frequencies and allele frequencies of CRP variations were similar between TA patients and controls. CRP haplotype frequencies in patients were not significantly different from those of controls. No significant association between serum CRP concentrations and genotypes was found. Moreover, no association was found in CRP concentration between patients with types I, II, and III TA or between patients with or without pulmonary involvement. By contrast, serum CRP concentration was directly correlated with disease severity. In conclusion, CRP polymorphisms were not associated with TA susceptibility or serum CRP levels in the Chinese Han population. However, higher CRP level was correlated with a more serious disease status, which implies that CRP possibly contributes to the progression of TA."
24897020,24897020,Genetic variants in human leukocyte antigen-DP influence both hepatitis C virus persistence and hepatitis C virus F protein generation in the Chinese Han population.,"Chronic hepatitis C is a serious liver disease that often results in cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this study was to assess the association of human leukocyte antigen-DP (HLA-DP) variants with risk of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) or anti-F antibody generation. We selected two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a region including HLA-DPA1 (rs3077) and HLA-DPB1 (rs9277534) and genotyped SNPs in 702 cases and 342 healthy controls from the Chinese population using TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. Moreover, the exon 2 of the HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 genes were amplified and determined by sequencing-based typing (SBT). The results showed that rs3077 significantly increased the risk of chronic HCV infection in additive models and dominant models (odds ratio (OR) = 1.32 and 1.53). The rs3077 also contributed to decrease the risk of anti-F antibody generation in additive models and dominant models (OR = 0.46 and 0.56). Subsequent analyses revealed the risk haplotypes (DPA1*0103-DPB1*0501 and DPA1*0103-DPB1*0201) and protective haplotypes (DPA1*0202-DPB1*0501 and DPA1*0202-DPB1*0202) to chronic HCV infection. Moreover, we also found that the haplotype of DPA1*0103-DPB1*0201 and DPA1*0202-DPB1*0202 were associated with the anti-F antibody generation. Our findings show that genetic variants in HLA-DP gene are associated with chronic HCV infection and anti-F antibody generation."
24899127,24899127,Functional characterization of the S41Y (C2755A) polymorphism of tryptophan hydroxylase 2.,"Human TPH2 (hTPH2) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in CNS serotonin biosynthesis. We characterized a single-nucleotide polymorphism (C2755A) in the hTPH2 gene that substitutes tyrosine for serine at position 41 in the regulatory domain of the enzyme. This polymorphism is associated with bipolar disorder and peripartum depression in a Chinese population. Recombinant h TPH2 human proteins were expressed in bacteria and also stably expressed in PC12 cells. Following bacterial expression and purification, the tyrosine for serine substitution at position 41 (S41Y) polymorphic enzyme displayed increased Vmax with unchanged Km values. By contrast, enzyme stability was decreased in vitro from 32 min to 4 min (37 °C) for the S41Y enzyme (as compared to the wild-type enzyme). The S41Y polymorphism decreased cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation ~ 50% relative to wild-type hTPH2, suggesting that the S41Y mutation may disrupt the post-translational regulation of this enzyme. Transfected PC12 cells expressed hTPH2 mRNA, active protein, and synthesized and released serotonin. Paradoxically, while S41Y-transfected PC12 cells expressed higher levels of hTPH2 than wild type, they synthesized less serotonin. These findings suggest a modified regulation of the S41Y gene variant leading to altered regulation and reduced neurotransmitter synthesis that may contribute to association of the polymorphism with bipolar disorder and depression. We report the functional implications of a polymorphic human tryptophan hydroxylase-2 gene associated with depression and bipolar disorder. The polymorphic enzyme (serine-41 converted to tyrosine) has increased activity, but decreased enzyme stability and serotonin production. Moreover, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of the mutant enzyme is decreased suggesting modified regulation of the S41Y variant leading to altered serotonin."

24940741,24940741,A genome-wide association study on chronic HBV infection and its clinical progression in male Han-Taiwanese.,"It is common to observe the clustering of chronic hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers in families. Intra-familial transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) could be the reason for the familial clustering of HBsAg carriers. Additionally, genetic and gender factors have been reported to be involved. We conducted a three-stage genome-wide association study to identify genetic factors associated with chronic HBV susceptibility. A total of 1,065 male controls and 1,623 male HBsAg carriers were included. The whole-genome genotyping was done on Illumina HumanHap550 beadchips in 304 healthy controls and HumanHap610 beadchips in 321 cases. We found that rs9277535 (HLA-DPB1, P = 4.87×10(-14)), rs9276370 (HLA-DQA2, P = 1.9×10(-12)), rs7756516 and rs7453920 (HLA-DQB2, P = 1.48×10(-11) and P = 6.66×10(-15) respectively) were significantly associated with persistent HBV infection. A novel SNP rs9366816 near HLA-DPA3 also showed significant association (P = 2.58×10(-10)). The ""T-T-G-G-T"" haplotype of the five SNPs further signified their association with the disease (P = 1.48×10(-12); OR = 1.49). The ""T-T"" haplotype composed of rs7756516 and rs9276370 was more prevalent in severe disease subgroups and associated with non-sustained therapeutic response (P = 0.0262). The ""G-C"" haplotype was associated with sustained therapeutic response (P = 0.0132; OR = 2.49). We confirmed that HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 loci were associated with persistent HBV infection in male Taiwan Han-Chinese. In addition, the HLA-DQA2 and -DQB2 complex was associated with clinical progression and therapeutic response."
24888570,24888570,Replication and cross-phenotype study based upon schizophrenia GWASs data in the Japanese population: support for association of MHC region with psychosis.,"Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of schizophrenia (SCZ) identified several susceptibility genes and suggested shared genetic components between SCZ and bipolar disorder (BD). We conducted a genetic association study of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected according to previous SCZ GWAS targeting psychotic disorders (SCZ and BD) in the Japanese population. Fifty-one SNPs were analyzed in a two-stage design using first-set screening samples (all SNPs: 1,032 SCZ, 1,012 BD, and 993 controls) and second-set replication samples (""significant"" SNPs in the first-set screening analysis: 1,808 SCZ, 821 BD, and 2,321 controls). We assessed allelic associations between the selected SNPs and the three phenotypes (SCZ, BD, and ""psychosis"" [SCZ + BD]). Nine SNPs revealed nominal association signals for all comparisons (P(uncorrected) < 0.05), of which two SNPs located in the major histocompatibility complex region (rs7759855 in zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 31 [ZSCAN31] and rs1736913 in HLA-F antisense RNA1 [HLA-F-AS1]) were further assessed in the second-set replication samples. The associations were confirmed for rs7759855 (P(corrected) = 0.026 for psychosis; P(corrected) = 0.032 for SCZ), although the direction of effect was opposite to that in the original GWAS of the Chinese population. Finally, a meta-analysis was conducted using our two samples and using our data and data from Psychiatric GWAS Consortium (PGC), which have shown the same direction of effect. SNP in ZSCAN31 (rs7759855) had the strongest association with the phenotypes (best P = 6.8 × 10(-5) for psychosis: present plus PGC results). These data support shared risk SNPs between SCZ and BD in the Japanese population and association between MHC and psychosis."
24890150,24890150,Prostasin gene polymorphism at rs12597511 is associated with severe preeclampsia in Chinese Han women.,"Preeclampsia, characterized by hypertension and proteinuria, is a multifactorial disease associated with shallow invasion of trophoblast cells and inadequate spiral artery remodeling. Trophoblast and tumor cells have similar invasion mechanism. Prostasin is closely related to tumor development, invasion and metastasis and influences blood pressure through activating epithelial sodium channel. The effect of prostasin on the pathogenesis of preeclampsia remains unclear. This study investigated the association of prostasin gene at rs12597511 with severe preeclampsia."
24891316,24891316,Genetic variant in the 3'-untranslated region of VEGFR1 gene influences chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer development in Chinese population.,"Lung inflammation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) are two pathogenic features for the two contextual diseases: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. VEGFR1 (or FLT1) plays a certain role in promoting tumour growth, inflammation and EMT. To simultaneously test the association between the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VEGFR1 and risk of COPD and lung cancer would reveal genetic mechanisms shared by these two diseases and joint aetiology. We conducted a two-population hospital-based case-control study. Three potential functional SNPs (rs664393, rs7326277 and rs9554314) were genotyped in southern Chinese and validated in eastern Chinese to explore their associations with COPD risk in 1511 COPD patients and 1677 normal lung function controls, and with lung cancer risk in 1559 lung cancer cases and 1679 cancer-free controls. We also detected the function of the promising SNP. Individuals carrying the rs7326277C (CT+CC) variant genotypes of VEGFR1 had a significant decrease in risk of both COPD (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.68-0.90) and lung cancer (OR = 0.79; 95% CI = 0.64-0.98), compared with those carrying the rs7326277TT genotype. Functional assays further showed that the rs7326277C genotypes had lower transcriptional activity and caused decreased VEGFR expression, compared with the rs7326277TT genotype. However, no significant association was observed for the other two SNPs (rs664393 and rs9554314) and either COPD or lung cancer risk. Our data suggested that the rs7326277C variant of VEGFR1 could reduce both COPD and lung cancer risk by lowering VEGFR1 mRNA expression; the SNP might be a common susceptible locus for both COPD and lung cancer."
24888492,24888492,Association of epithelial sodium channel β-subunit common polymorphism with essential hypertension families in a Chinese population.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether common polymorphisms in the C-terminus of SCNN1B gene encoding the β-subunit of epithelial sodium channel are associated with essential hypertension (EH) in Chinese hypertensive families. A total of 433 subjects from 102 EH families were recruited. Biochemical and anthropometric indices and systematic screening of the C-terminus of SCNN1B were performed. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found. Homozygotes for the common A allele at rs3743966 had on average a 12.06 mmHg higher SBP and a 7.43 mmHg higher DBP than homozygotes for the rarer T allele. AA + AT genotype of rs3743966 was also found to maybe a risk factor of hypertension by logistic regression and transmission/disequilibrium test. AA + AT genotype of rs3743966 maybe a risk factor of EH. In conclusion, there was a significant association between the rs3743966 SNP in intron 12 and EH in Chinese hypertensive families."

Early growth response 3 (Egr3) is a critical determinant of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling in activated endothelial cells. If endothelial cells are excessively activated, it may lead to vasculopathic diseases, such as pathologic angiogenesis, inflammation, and atherosclerosis. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between the Egr3 gene polymorphisms and CAD."
24888991,24888991,Association between dopamine beta-hydroxylase 19-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism and major depressive disorder.,"Norepinephrine and dopamine mediate important aspects of several psychoses, including major depressive disorder (MDD). Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine in central neurons and thus is critically involved in maintaining the transformational homeostasis. Functional polymorphisms have been reported in DBH gene, including a 19-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism (DBH5'-insertion/deletion (Ins/Del)) and a single nucleotide polymorphism (-1021C/T). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there was an association between the two functional polymorphisms and MDD in a Han Chinese population. DBH5'-Ins/Del and -1021C/T polymorphism in promoter region of DBH gene was analyzed in 313 patients with MDD and 318 healthy subjects by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The results showed statistically significant associations for genotypic distribution between the DBH5'-Ins/Del polymorphism and MDD (P = 0.007). Individuals with Del/Del genotype demonstrated a 1.72 times increased risk of MDD compared to those with insertion alleles (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-2.47, P = 0.003). Moreover, the Del/Del genotype was associated with poorer digital span and language scores than the insertion alleles in healthy subjects (P = 0.041 and P = 0.048, respectively). However, there was no association observed between the genotype and allele frequencies for -1021C/T and depression. Our data suggest that the DBH5'-Ins/Del polymorphism of the DBH gene may be associated with susceptibility to MDD in a Chinese population."
24861646,24861646,Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms of ERCC1 and XPF with colorectal cancer risk and interaction with tobacco use.,"We investigated the association between polymorphisms in excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) (rs3212986, rs2298881 and rs11615) and xeroderma pigmentosum-complementation group F (XPF) (rs2276466 and rs6498486) and risk of colorectal cancer. A 1:1 matched case-control study was conducted. Conditional regression analysis indicated that individuals carrying the ERCC1 rs3212986 TT genotype and T allele had a marginally increased risk of colorectal cancer when compared with subjects with the GG genotype. Similarly, subjects carrying the rs11615 TT genotype and T allele had a marginally increased risk of colorectal cancer when compared with those with the CC genotype. Stratified analysis revealed that individuals with rs3212986 TT who were current or former smokers had a significantly increased risk of colorectal cancer, and a significant interaction was found between this SNP and cigarette smoking. In conclusion, our study suggests that rs3212986 and rs11615 polymorphisms are associated with risk of colorectal cancer in a Chinese population, particularly in smokers. This finding could be useful in revealing the genetic characteristics of colorectal cancer, and suggests more effective strategies for prevention and treatment."

24854447,24854447,Association analysis of colorectal cancer susceptibility variants with gastric cancer in a Chinese Han population.,"Evidence suggests that some genetic variants are risk factors for both colorectal cancer (CRC) and gastric cancer (GC). Thus, we selected 12 reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genome-wide association studies of CRC and conducted this case-control study to assess the associations between these SNPs and the risk for GC in a southern Chinese population. All SNPs were genotyped in 249 individuals with GC and 292 healthy population-matched subjects using the Sequenom MassArray iPLEX System. Association analyses based on the c2 test and binary logistic regression were performed to determine the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) for each SNP. A stratified analysis by gender was also performed. Borderline significant associations were observed for rs4444235 (P = 0.070) and rs10411210 (P = 0.084), both fitting the overdominant model. The rs4444235 CT genotype showed a protective effect (OR = 0.72, 95%CI = 0.50-1.03), while the rs10411210 CT genotype was a risk factor (OR = 1.40, 95%CI = 0.96-2.05) as compared with the CC+TT genotype. In the female subgroup, the rs6983267 GT genotype (compared with TT, OR = 2.31, 95%CI = 1.07-4.99) and the rs10505477 CT genotype (compared with TT, OR = 2.36, 95%CI = 1.09-5.11) significantly increased the risk for GC. No significant association was detected for the other SNPs. These results provide evidence that known genetic variants associated with CRC risk may also confer risk for GC."

24864251,24864251,rs744166 polymorphism of the STAT3 gene is associated with risk of gastric cancer in a Chinese population.,"The aim of this study was to explore the association between polymorphisms in signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 (STAT3) and the risk of gastric cancer. In the present study, a case-control study was conducted in which rs2293152 and rs744166 polymorphisms in STAT3 were analyzed in 209 Chinese patients with gastric cancer and 294 cancer-free controls. The genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism method. For the rs744166 polymorphism, the TC genotype (adjusted OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.39-0.92, and P = 0.020) and CC genotype (adjusted OR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.21-0.80, and P = 0.009) were associated with a decreased risk of gastric cancer compared to the TT genotype. However, rs2293152 did not show any difference in gastric cancer risk between patients and controls in the CG/CC genotype compared to the GG genotype. Besides, the SNP effects were additive to the effects of environmental factors without any interaction between them in the susceptibility to gastric cancer. Collectively, rs744166 polymorphism might be significantly associated with a decreased risk of gastric cancer in a Chinese population. Additionally, polymorphisms in STAT3, along with environmental factors, might be associated with the development of gastric cancer."
24857622,24857622,IL-17F but not IL-17A gene polymorphism confers risk to multiple sclerosis in a Chinese Han population.,"Interleukin-17 has been shown to be associated with autoimmune disease. The aim of the current study is to investigate the potential association of IL-17 polymorphisms with multiple sclerosis (MS) in Chinese Han patients. Two SNPs, rs763780 of IL-17F gene and rs2275913 of IL-17A gene were genotyped in 622 MS patients and 743 healthy controls by using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method (PCR-RFLP). Allele and genotype frequencies distribution of the two SNPs were examined between patients and controls using the Chi-Square test. All genotypic and allelic frequencies of the tested IL-17 polymorphisms in control cohort were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A significantly increased frequency of rs763780 TT genotype (corrected p value (Pc)=0.024, odds ratio=1.472, 95% CI=1.133-1.913) and T allele (corrected P (Pc)=0.018, odds ratio=1.446, 95% CI=1.134-1.844) was detected in MS patients compared with controls. The genotypic and allelic frequencies of rs2275913 in IL-17A gene were not different between patients with MS and controls. These results suggest that rs763780 is associated with multiple sclerosis in a Chinese Han population."
24852829,24852829,The association of single nucleotide polymorphism of the Fyn gene with sporadic Alzheimer's disease in the Chinese Han population.,"Recent studies suggested genetic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD). Fibroblast Yes related novel (Fyn), a tau kinase, has been reported to be associated with aberrant phosphorylated tau and neurofibrillary tangles formation. Fyn gene may be a potential candidate gene for AD. To investigate the association of the polymorphisms in Fyn gene with the susceptibility to sAD, we conducted a case-control study in a Chinese Han cohort including 200 sAD patients and 243 control participants. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs111787668, rs1057979, rs6916861 and rs12910) within the promoter region of Fyn gene and one (rs7768046) in intron were selected and genotyped with a polymerase chain reaction-ligase detection reaction (PCR-LDR) method. Logistic regression under four genetic models was used to analyze the association between target SNPs and the risk of sAD. After adjusting for age, sex and APOE ɛ4 status, no association was revealed between these SNPs or the haplotypes containing four SNPs and the risk of sAD (P>0.05). The SNPs in the selected regions of the Fyn gene are unlikely to confer the susceptibility of sAD in the Chinese Han population. Further studies with a larger sample size and different ethnic populations are needed to reveal the role of Fyn gene in the pathogenesis of sAD."

Phosphofructokinase, muscle type (PFKM), is a key regulatory enzyme used to catalyze the irreversible conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate in glycolysis. The present study was designed to investigate the association of PFKM SNP and meat quality traits in pigs. In this study, the 2,864-bp full-length cDNA sequence of the porcine PFKM gene was obtained, which contained 30 bp of 5' UTR, 2,343 bp of coding region, and 491 bp of 3' UTR. The porcine PFKM mRNA was predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart.

This case-control association study enrolled 382 unrelated Mauritian Indian children, 193 with asthma and 189 healthy controls, and 384 unrelated Chinese Han children, 192 with asthma and 192 healthy controls. The SNP loci were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism for the Chinese Han samples and TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR for the Mauritian Indian samples. In the Mauritian Indian children, there was a significant difference in the distribution of IL13 C1923T between the asthma and control groups (P=0.033). The frequency of IL13 C1923T T/T in the Mauritian Indian asthma group was significantly higher than in the control group [odds ratio (OR)=2.119, 95% confidence interval=1.048-4.285]. The Chinese Han children with asthma had significantly higher frequencies of MS4A2 C-109T T/T (OR=1.961, P=0.001) and ADRB2 R16G A/A (OR=2.575, P=0.000) than the control group. The IL13 C1923T locus predisposed to asthma in Mauritian Indian children, which represents an ethnic difference from the Chinese Han population.

The aim of this study was to examine the association of a single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs7396562, of the interferon induced with single immunoglobulin IL-1-related receptor (SIGIRR) gene with SLE in a Chinese population. A total of 741 SLE patients and 731 healthy control subjects were enrolled in the present study. The genotyping of polymorphism (rs7396562) was determined by TaqMan allele discrimination assay on the 7,300 real-time polymerase chain reaction system. The frequency of T allele for rs7396562 in patients was significantly higher than in controls (T versus G, OR=1.318, 95 % confidence interval (CI)=1.139-1.525, P<0.001). Fortunately, some significant difference in genotype distribution was found between cases and controls (P<0.001). We also found some significant evidence for the association of the SIGIRR rs7396562 polymorphism with SLE between dominant and recessive model (TG+TT versus GG, P=0.002; TT versus TG+GG, P=0.002). We also analyzed the association of the SIGIRR rs7396562 T allele with clinical features; luckily, photosensitivity and malar rash had some significant signal with the SNP.

The association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the Frizzled 3 (FZD3) and Frizzled 6 (FZD6) genes and NTDs in the Han population of northern China was principally studied. One synonymous SNP (rs2241802) in FZD3 gene and three nonsynonymous SNPs (rs827528, rs3808553 and rs12549394) in FZD6 gene were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing methods in 135 NTD patients and 135 normal controls. The allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies were calculated and analyzed to examine the relationship between FZD3/FZD6 SNPs and NTDs. Both T allele and TT genotype frequencies of the FZD6 rs3808553 loci in the NTDs group were significantly higher than those in the controls, and children with T allele and TT genotype were associated with increased NTDs risk (OR = 1.575, 95 % CI 1.112-2.230, P = 0.010 and OR = 2.811, 95 % CI 1.325-5.967, P = 0.023, respectively). There were no differences among different genotypes or alleles in other three SNPs. Haplotypes A-G-C and A-T-C in FZD6 were found associated with NTDs in the case-control study (OR = 0.560, 95 % CI 0.378-0.830, P = 0.004 and OR = 1.670, 95 % CI 1.126-2.475, P = 0.011, respectively).

24819332,24819332,Association study of interleukin-19 rs2243188 polymorphism with systemic lupus erythematosus in a Chinese population.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2243188 of interleukin-19 (IL-19), show significant evidence for association with SLE in a Chinese population. A total of 545 SLE patients and 613 healthy controls were collected in the present study. The genotyping of IL-19 rs2243188 polymorphism was detected by TaqMan allele discrimination assay on the 7300 real time polymorphism chain reaction system. The minor C allele of rs2243188, relative to the major A allele, appeared to have a significantly lower frequency in SLE patients (31.0%) as compared with controls (35.5%) (χ(2) = 5.19, p = 0.023). We also discovered a statistical significance in the dominant model (CC + CA versus AA: OR = 0.755, 95% CI = 0.598-0.953, p = 0.018). However, no significant difference in genotype distribution was found between SLE patients and controls (p = 0.056). Furthermore, an increased frequency of CC genotype were also detected in lupus nephritis (LN) groups as compared with non-LN groups (p = 0.024). Besides, the individuals with CC genotype had a 2.201-fold higher risk for the susceptibility to LN than those A allele carriers (AA + CA) (p = 0.006). Unfortunately, the analyses on the relationship of IL-19 rs2243188 with several clinical manifestations of SLE failed to find any significant results. In conclusion, our observations suggested the minor C allele of SNP rs2243188 might be a protective factor for SLE in a Chinese Han population. Moreover, the subgroup analysis highlighted that IL-19 rs2243188 SNP was associated with the susceptibility to LN patients."
24798189,24798189,Polymorphisms of the TNFAIP3 region and Graves' disease.,"Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) is a multifactorial organ-specific autoimmune disorder, and both genetic susceptibility and environmental factors are involved in its etiology. TNFAIP3 encodes the ubiquitin-modifying enzyme (A20), a key regulator of inflammatory signaling pathways. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between TNFAIP3 gene polymorphisms and AITD in Chinese Han population. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TNFAIP3 gene locus (rs598493, rs610604 and rs661561) were detected in a set of 667 patients with AITD and 301 controls in Han Chinese population using the Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer (MALDI-TOF-MS) Platform. Compared with those of the controls, the frequencies of GG genotype of rs598493, the AA genotype of rs610604, the allele G and GG genotype of rs661561 were significantly increased in Graves' disease (GD) patients. However, the frequencies of AG genotype of rs598493 and AC genotype of rs610604 were significantly decreased in GD patients. The ATC haplotype (rs598493, rs661561 and rs610604) was associated with a decreased risk of GD. No significant differences in the three SNPs were observed between HT patients and controls. Our study shows a clear association between the polymorphisms of TNFAIP3 gene and GD, not HT, suggesting that TNFAIP3 gene is likely to be a genetic susceptibility factor to GD."

24804191,24804191,A Promoter Region Polymorphism in PDCD-1 Gene Is Associated with Risk of Rheumatoid Arthritis in the Han Chinese Population of Southeastern China.,"Objective. Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) induces negative signals to T cells during interaction with its ligands and is therefore a candidate gene in the development of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Herein, we investigate the association of PDCD-1 polymorphisms with the risk of RA among Chinese patients and healthy controls. Methods. Using the PCR-direct sequencing analysis, 4 PDCD-1 SNPs (rs36084323, rs11568821, rs2227982, and rs2227981) were genotyped in 320 RA patients and 309 matched healthy controls. Expression of PD-1 was determined in peripheral blood lymphocytes by flow cytometry and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Results. We observed that the GG genotype of rs36084323 was associated with a increased risk for developing RA (OR 1.70, 95% 1.11-2.61, P = 0.049). Patients carrying G/G genotype displayed an increased mRNA level of PD-1 (P = 0.04) compared with A/A genotype and healthy controls. Meanwhile, patients homozygous for rs36084323 had induced basal PD-1 expression on activated CD4+ T cells. Conclusion. The PDCD-1 polymorphism rs36084323 was significantly associated with RA risk in Han Chinese population. This SNP, which effectively influenced the expression of PD-1, may be a biomarker of early diagnosis of RA and a suitable indicator of utilizing PD-1 inhibitor for treatment of RA."

Peripheral blood was collected from 180 unrelated patients with hypertension and 540 healthy volunteers (control group), and DNA was extracted to amplify the 5'-flanking region and 2 exons of the NPPB gene by polymerase chain reaction; the fragment was sequenced after purification. The clinical data of all subjects were recorded, the distribution of the NPPB gene c.-1298 G/T polymorphism was determined, and differences in clinical indicators between the two groups were evaluated. The mean arterial pressure PP, and creatinine levels were significantly higher in the hypertension group than in the control group (P<0.05), but no other clinical indicators differed between the groups. There were no significant differences in genotype frequency and distribution of the NPPB gene c.-1298 G/T polymorphism between the hypertension group and the control group (P>0.05); in the control group, the mean PP of individuals with the SNP c.-1298 GG genotype was greater than that of individuals with the GT+TT genotype (P<0.05). In conclusion, there was no significant correlation between the NPPB gene c.-1298 G/T polymorphism and the incidence of essential hypertension in the Han population; however, the PP of the SNP c.-1298 GG genotype was greater than that of the GT+TT genotype in the control group."

24780616,24780616,Frequent mutation of rs13281615 and its association with PVT1 expression and cell proliferation in breast cancer.,"The q24 band of chromosome 8 (8q24) is frequently amplified in human cancers including breast cancer, and several SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) at 8q24, including rs13281615, have been identified for their association with cancer risks. These SNPs are in a ""gene desert"" region, and their functions in cancer development remain to be illustrated, although several of the SNPs appear to influence the genes in the ""desert"" in a long-range manner, including the v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) and the non-protein coding plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1), both of which have been implicated in human cancers. In the current study, we examined rs13281615 for its potential role in breast cancer using normal and cancer tissues from 121 Chinese women with breast cancer. In addition to confirming the association of the GG genotype of rs13281615 with breast cancer risk, we found that germline GG genotype was significantly associated with estrogen receptor (ER) positivity, higher tumor grade and higher proliferation index. We also found frequent somatic mutations (22/121 or 18.2%) of this SNP in breast cancer. Interestingly, the majority of the mutations (17/22 or 77%) involved a G→A change, resulting in a decrease in the number of cancers with the GG risk genotype and subsequent loss of GG association with higher tumor grade and proliferation index in cancers. Furthermore, PVT1 expression was increased in cancers, and the increase was associated with the GG genotype of rs13281615. These results suggest that the GG genotype of SNP rs13281615 plays a role in breast cancer likely by influencing PVT1 expression, and that during oncogenesis, ""protective"" mutations could occur."

A hospital-based case-control study was performed in 200 patients with CRC and 200 matched healthy donors. Two SNPs in miRNA binding of ITGB1 and ITGB3 genes (rs17468 and rs2317676) were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restrict fragment length polymorphism assay. The association between genotypes and CRC risk was evaluated by computing the odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) from multivariate unconditional logistic regression analyses. The frequency of the T genotype in ITGB1 rs17468 and G genotype in ITGB3 rs2317676 occurred more frequently in CRC patients than in controls (P < 0.05). We found that CT and TT genotypes of rs17468 were associated with a significantly increased risk of CRC (OR = 1.67, 95 % CI = 1.090-2.559 for CT + TT vs. CC), also the AG and GG genotype in ITGB3 rs2317676 (OR = 1.65, 95 % CI = 1.114-2.458 for AG + GG vs. AA). In conclusion, our results showed that both the ITGB1 rs17468 SNP and ITGB3 rs2317676 SNP were associated with an increased risk of CRC, which suggests that these 2 SNPs might contribute to CRC risk in a Chinese population."

24769516,24769516,Polymorphisms of microRNA-binding sites in integrin genes are associated with oral squamous cell carcinoma susceptibility and progression.,"Integrins, which act as an important role in the connection between cells and extra-cellular environments, are important cell surface receptors. Integrins have been demonstrated to play critical roles in many aspects of the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in microRNA-binding sites of integrin genes and the susceptibility and progression of OSCC in Chinese Han Population. We recruited 167 OSCC patients and 200 cancer-free controls from three independent medical centers. Genotyping was completed successfully for the five selected integrin SNPs: rs1062484 (integrin α3), rs11902171 (integrin αv), rs17468 (integrin β1), rs3809865 (integrin β3), and rs2675 (integrin β5). The results demonstrated that the A allele of rs3809865 T/A (a T-to-A nucleotide change), a functional polymorphism in the 3'UTR of integrin β3 gene, was associated with OSCC risk (p < 0.05). In addition, the association analysis between this SNP and integrin β3 mRNA expression level in the patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells indicated that OSCC patients carrying the A allele would have a lower integrin β3 expression level (p = 0.047). Meanwhile, survival analysis showed that the C allele of rs2675 A/C (nucleotide change from A to C), another 3'UTR polymorphism in integrin β5 gene, was related with progression of OSCC. Overall, our results suggest that rs3809865 and rs2675 may contribute to OSCC risk and progression in Chinese Han Population. These two SNPs may be used as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for OSCC in future."

This study aims to assess the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CD98 gene on prognosis of NSCLC patients. We genotyped three potential functional SNPs in CD98 gene using Sequenom iPLEX genotyping system in a cohort of 482 NSCLC patients. Multivariate cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier curve were used for the survival analysis. The variant-containing genotypes of rs1059292 in 5'-flanking region of CD98 gene were significantly associated with an increased risk of death in the multivariate analysis (Hazard ratio [HR], 1.49; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.04-2.14 in a dominant model). In stratified analysis, the association remained significant in patients with poor differentiation (HR=1.81, 95% CI=1.01-3.25). In addition, rs1059292 also showed a borderline significant association with T stage (OR=1.49; 95% CI: 0.96-2.35) and N stage (OR=1.53; 95% CI: 0.98-2.39). Functional analysis demonstrated that variant genotype of SNP rs1059292 significantly enhanced the transcription activity of CD98 gene promoter. Our data suggest that genetic variation of rs1059292 in CD98 gene may affect clinical outcome of NSCLC in Chinese population."

The vesicular glutamate transporter 1 coded by SLC17A7 gene has been reported associated with MDD. According to its role in glutamate transmission, it is reasonable to consider it as a potential pharmacogenetic candidate in SSRI treatment. A total of 290 MDD patients who had been taking SSRIs for 6 weeks were recruited. Their genotypes were assessed for the presence of 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which were selected from either the HapMap Chinese ethnic group or the literature report.

We confirmed that the strongest signal came from a SNP located at HLA-DPB2 [rs3117027, odds ratio (OR) = 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.16-1.43, P = 1.9 × 10(-6) for A allele] and that this effect is not driven by associations with classic HLA alleles. In silico analysis further revealed that this SNP is highly correlated with rs3129294 (D' = 1, r(2) = 0.95 in controls), which may have a putative regulatory function. We also identified an independent association at DPB1*0402, which conferred decreased risk of cervical cancer (OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.63-0.89, P = 7.0 × 10(-4)) and is independent of previously described associations with HLA-B*0702, DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602, and DRB1*1301-DQA1*0103-DQB1*0603. No association was found with the two SNPs (rs4282438 or rs9277952) that were recently identified within the HLA-DP region in a cervical cancer GWAS in the Chinese population. Our study provides the first systematic investigation of the association of genetic variants in the HLA-DP region with cervical cancer susceptibility and provides further insight into the contribution of polymorphisms in the HLA-DP region to risk of cervical cancer."

24729087,24729087,CD 152 gene polymorphisms and risk of osteosarcoma in Chinese population.,"Osteosarcoma has become a health threat for adolescents and young adults. To identify the genetic risk factor for the malignancy is in urgent need. Several studies have investigated the role of CD 152 polymorphisms in osteosarcoma in a sample of Chinese population. However, the association is poorly defined due to lack of a sufficiently large sample. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of all CD 152 polymorphisms that had been implicated in osteosarcoma to examine the association. We searched the electronic MEDLINE database until December 31, 2013, to identify the studies regarding the association between CD 152 polymorphisms and osteosarcoma. Inclusion criteria were followed in the selection of eligible study. The genotypic and allelic data were collected from all studies included to evaluate the risk of osteosarcoma (odds ratio, OR). We found statistically significant evidence of the studied CD 152 polymorphisms and increased risk of osteosarcoma in homozygous (OR = 1.79, 95 % CI = 1.40-2.29, P = 0.958), recessive (OR = 1.77, 95 % CI = 1.40-2.25, P = 0.899), and allele model (OR = 1.21, 95 % CI = 1.09-1.34, P = 1.000). This increased risk was also revealed in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) +49G>A and SNP 326G>A. Our meta-analysis indicates that there may be an association between CD 152 polymorphisms and risk of osteosarcoma in Chinese population. Further validation of the observation is necessary."

24706317,24706317,Meta analysis of the association of rs7702187 SNP in SEMA5A gene with risk of Parkinson's disease.,The aim of our study was to derive a more precise estimation of the association between the SEMA5A rs7702187 polymorphism and the susceptibility for PD by using meta-analysis.
24718422,24718422,Genetic variants in the EPCAM gene is associated with the prognosis of transarterial chemoembolization treated hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus.,"The epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM) is involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of many malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of EPCAM have been reported to be with the risk and prognosis of several malignancies. However, the association of SNPs in EPCAM gene with the prognosis of HCC patients has never been investigated. In this study, two functional SNPs (rs1126497 and rs1421) in the EPCAM gene were selected and genotyped in a cohort of 448 unresectable Chinese HCC patients treated by TACE. The association of the two SNPs with the overall survival (OS) of patients was assessed by univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier curve. Our data showed that there was no significant association between either SNP and OS of patients. However, in the stratified analysis, the variant-containing genotypes (WV+VV) of SNP rs1126497 exhibited a significant association with poorer OS in HCC patients who had portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) in multivariate analysis of Cox proportional hazard model (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-2.53, P = 0.007), and in Kaplan-Meier curve analysis (P = 0.023), comparing to those carrying wild-type genotype. Our results suggest that SNP rs1126497 in the EPCAM gene may serve as an independent prognosis biomarker for unresectable HCC patient with PVTT, which warranted further validating investigation."
24740293,24740293,Identification of selection footprints on the X chromosome in pig.,"Identifying footprints of selection can provide a straightforward insight into the mechanism of artificial selection and further dig out the causal genes related to important traits. In this study, three between-population and two within-population approaches, the Cross Population Extend Haplotype Homozygosity Test (XPEHH), the Cross Population Composite Likelihood Ratio (XPCLR), the F-statistics (Fst), the Integrated Haplotype Score (iHS) and the Tajima's D, were implemented to detect the selection footprints on the X chromosome in three pig breeds using Illumina Porcine60K SNP chip. In the detection of selection footprints using between-population methods, 11, 11 and 7 potential selection regions with length of 15.62 Mb, 12.32 Mb and 9.38 Mb were identified in Landrace, Chinese Songliao and Yorkshire by XPEHH, respectively, and 16, 13 and 17 potential selection regions with length of 15.20 Mb, 13.00 Mb and 19.21 Mb by XPCLR, 4, 2 and 4 potential selection regions with length of 3.20 Mb, 1.60 Mb and 3.20 Mb by Fst. For within-population methods, 7, 10 and 9 potential selection regions with length of 8.12 Mb, 8.40 Mb and 9.99 Mb were identified in Landrace, Chinese Songliao and Yorkshire by iHS, and 4, 3 and 2 potential selection regions with length of 3.20 Mb, 2.40 Mb and 1.60 Mb by Tajima's D. Moreover, the selection regions from different methods were partly overlapped, especially the regions around 22∼25 Mb were detected under selection in Landrace and Yorkshire while no selection in Chinese Songliao by all three between-population methods. Only quite few overlap of selection regions identified by between-population and within-population methods were found. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the genes relevant with meat quality, reproduction and immune were found in potential selection regions. In addition, three out of five significant SNPs associated with hematological traits reported in our genome-wide association study were harbored in potential selection regions."
24692236,24692236,Novel QTL at chromosome 6p22 for alcohol consumption: Implications for the genetic liability of alcohol use disorders.,"Linkage studies of alcoholism have implicated several chromosome regions, leading to the successful identification of susceptibility genes, including ADH4 and GABRA2 on chromosome 4. Quantitative endophenotypes that are potentially closer to gene action than clinical endpoints offer a means of obtaining more refined linkage signals of genes that predispose alcohol use disorders (AUD). In this study we examine a self-reported measure of the maximum number of drinks consumed in a 24-hr period (abbreviated Max Drinks), a significantly heritable phenotype (h(2)  = 0.32 ± 0.05; P = 4.61 × 10(-14)) with a strong genetic correlation with AUD (ρg  = 0.99 ± 0.13) for the San Antonio Family Study (n = 1,203). Genome-wide SNPs were analyzed using variance components linkage methods in the program SOLAR, revealing a novel, genome-wide significant QTL (LOD = 4.17; P = 5.85 × 10(-6)) for Max Drinks at chromosome 6p22.3, a region with a number of compelling candidate genes implicated in neuronal function and psychiatric illness. Joint analysis of Max Drinks and AUD status shows that the QTL has a significant non-zero effect on diagnosis (P = 4.04 × 10(-3)), accounting for 8.6% of the total variation. Significant SNP associations for Max Drinks were also identified at the linkage region, including one, rs7761213 (P = 2.14 × 10(-4)), obtained for an independent sample of Chinese families. Thus, our study identifies a potential risk locus for AUD at 6p22.3, with significant pleiotropic effects on the heaviness of alcohol consumption that may not be population specific."

24701036,24701036,The functional polymorphisms of miR-146a are associated with susceptibility to severe sepsis in the Chinese population.,"MicroRNA-146a (miR-146a) acts as a pivotal regulatory molecule in immune response and various diseases, such as carcinoma and autoimmune diseases. Growing evidences have demonstrated the association of miR-146a gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with risk of several diseases, but no genetic relevance studies of miR-146a gene polymorphisms to sepsis have been reported by now. Our study has analyzed the association of sepsis with two functional miR-146a gene SNPs rs2910164 G/C and rs57095329 A/G in a Chinese Han population (226 sepsis cases; 206 healthy controls). Our results indicated a higher prevalence of the miR-146a gene SNP rs2910164 C allele and CC genotype in patients with severe sepsis (rs2910164G versus rs2910164C: P = 0.0029, odds ratio (OR) = 1.664; GG+GC versus CC: P = 0.0045, OR = 1.947). Neither the genotype nor the allele in rs57095329 showed significant differences between the septic cases and the controls (P = 0.5901 and 0.3580, resp.), and no significant difference was observed in the subgroups. In addition, we confirmed that the two SNPs rs2910164 and rs57095329 could functionally affect the miR-146a expression levels and the reduction of miR146a was accompanied with the upregulation of the expression levels of TRAF-6 and IRAK-1 in severe sepsis patients. This present study might provide valuable clinical evidence that miR-146a gene polymorphism rs2910164 is associated with the risk of severe sepsis."

24688788,24688788,Association of eNOS polymorphisms with anterior chamber depth in han chinese: jiangsu eye study.,"Recently, a study reported that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were associated with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) in Australian cohort. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether those eNOS SNPs are associated with primary angle closure (PAC) or ocular biometric characteristics such as axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), and diopter of spherical power (DS) in Han Chinese. The samples consisted of 232 PAC subjects and 306 controls collected from a population-based prevalence survey conducted in Funing County of Jiangsu, China. The rs3793342 and rs11771443 in eNOS were genotyped by TaqMan-MGB probe using the RT-PCR system. Our data did not identify any association of the eNOS SNPs with PAC. However, the analysis on the quantitative traits of ocular biometrics showed that the ACD of rs11771443 AA and GA carriers is significantly deeper than that of rs11771443 GG carriers (P = 0.0025), even though the AL and DS are not associated with rs11771443 genotypes. Rs3793342 was not associated with any biometric parameters including ACD, AL and DS. In summary, our data indicates that eNOS rs11771443 is associated with ACD and its role in the pathogenesis of PACG warranted further study."

24684230,24684230,Analysis of interleukin-10 promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in a Malaysian population.,"We evaluated the association of two IL10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1800896 and rs1800871) with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) risk in the three major races of the Malaysian population (Malay, Chinese and Indian; 317 cases and 330 controls). Our initial screening demonstrated that rs1800871 but not rs1800896 was significantly associated with increased NHL risk in Malays (pMalay-Rec = 0.007) and Chinese only (pChinese-Rec = 0.039). Subsequent combined analysis of the Malay and Chinese revealed significant association of rs1800871 with all (ALL) NHL subtypes (pMeta-ALL-NHL-Rec = 0.001), ALL B-cell subtypes (pMeta-ALL-B-cell-Rec = 0.003), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) subtype (pMeta-DLBCL-Rec = 0.002) and ALL T-cell subtypes (pMeta-ALL-T-cell-Rec = 0.031). SNP rs1800896 showed increased risk only in follicular lymphoma (FL) (pMeta-FL-Dom = 0.0004). We also detected a male-specific association of rs1800871 with increased NHL risk (pMeta-Male-ALL-NHL-Rec = 0.006) in the combined analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the association of IL10 promoter SNPs with NHL susceptibility in the three major races of Malaysia."

Considering steroid hormone-mediated signaling pathways have an important role in the progression of gastric cancer, we hypothesized that MAP3K1 rs889312 may be associated with survival outcomes in gastric cancer. The purpose of this study was to test this hypothesis."
24676996,24676996,Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-9 (CHRNA9) polymorphisms are associated with NSCLC risk in a Chinese population.,"Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-9 (CHRNA9) encodes a plasma membrane protein of divalent cation channels and is expressed in keratinocytes. This study aimed to investigate CHRNA9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for association with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) risk, in a Chinese population. This case-control study included 500 NSCLC patients and 500 age-matched healthy controls. CHRNA9 rs56159866, rs6819385, rs55998310, and rs182073550 SNPs were genotyped and associated for NSCLC risk by computing the odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) from multivariate unconditional logistic regression analyses with adjustment for age. The frequencies of the CHRNA9 rs6819385 G allele were 16.1, 15.2, and 20.8% in male NSCLC patients, male SCC patients, and male controls, respectively. The CHRNA9 rs6819385 A allele was associated with an increased risk of developing NSCLC (P = 0.04, OR = 1.37; 95% CI 1.02-1.83) and SCC (P = 0.04, OR = 1.47; 95% CI 1.01-2.13). The CHRNA9 rs6819385 A/A homozygote was associated with an increased risk of NSCLC and SCC in all patients (OR = 1.38; 95% CI 1.06-1.79; P = 0.02, and OR = 1.61; 95% CI 1.09-2.38; P = 0.02, respectively) and in male patients (OR = 1.57; 95% CI 1.11-2.21; P = 0.01, and OR = 1.70; 95% CI 1.11-2.61; P = 0.01, respectively), indicating that the CHRNA9 rs6819385 A/A homozygote had a 1.61-fold and 1.70-fold increased risk of developing lung SCC in all patients (95% CI 1.09-2.38, P = 0.02) and in males (95% CI 1.11-2.61, P = 0.01), respectively. The CHRNA9 rs6819385 SNP was significantly associated with an increased risk of NSCLC, especially for SCC in male patients in this Chinese population."
24688318,24688318,Association study of ARL15 and CDH13 with T2DM in a Han Chinese population.,"Several studies indicate that plasma adiponectin levels are associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or T2DM risk factors in diverse populations. In addition to the adiponectin gene, several other genes have been postulated to influence plasma adiponectin levels. In this study, we investigated two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs4311394 and rs4783244, located intronically in the ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 15 (ARL15) and the T-cadherin (CDH13) genes, respectively. These SNPs were detected in a Han Chinese population using a TaqMan assay and evaluated for association with T2DM as well as with individual metabolic traits. Allele frequencies for rs4311394 were significantly different in T2DM and nondiabetes (NDM) groups (χ² = 4.49, P = 0.034). However, neither allele nor genotype frequencies for rs4783244 were associated with T2DM (χ² = 0.33, P = 0.56 and χ² = 2.35, P = 0.31 respectively). The SNPs did not exhibit significant association with individual metabolic traits in the T2DM and NDM groups. Our results indicated that the G allele of the rs4311394 might be a susceptibility factor for T2DM in the Han Chinese population (odds ratio: 1.20; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.41)."
24672801,24672801,A replication study for the association of rs726252 in PAPPA2 with developmental dysplasia of the hip in Chinese Han population.,"Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a common developmental hip disorder, which ranges from mild acetabulum malformation to irreducible hip dislocation. A previous study suggested a significant association of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A2 (PAPPA2) with DDH susceptibility in Chinese Han population. But with the consideration of the sample size, the association was still debatable. To confirm the association of the reported single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in PAPPA2, rs726252 with DDH, we conducted a case-control study in a larger number of subjects. We genotyped rs726252 in 697 DDH subjects and 707 control subjects by TaqMan assay. The association between this SNP and DDH was evaluated statistically. No significant difference was found in any comparison of genotype distribution nor allele frequency between cases and controls. Our replication study indicated that the association between rs726252 and DDH in Chinese Han population was debatable. The association between PAPPA2 and DDH should be evaluated by additional studies."

Epidemiological studies have suggested associations between APE1 rs1760944 polymorphism and cancer risk. This study was aimed to evaluate the relationship between APE1 rs1760944 polymorphism and cancer risk. We searched Pubmed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Embase, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases until September 2013 to identify eligible studies. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were used to estimate the strength of the associations. 12 studies from 11 articles on APE1 rs1760944 genotypes and cancer risk were identified, including a total of 6,419 cancer cases and 6,781 case-free controls. Overall, APE1 rs1760944 polymorphism was significantly associated with the decreased risk of cancer in any genetic models (G vs. T: OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.82-0.90; homozygote comparison: OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.67-0.82; heterozygote comparison: OR =0.88, 95%CI = 0.81-0.95; dominant model TG+GG vs. TT: OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.76-0.89; recessive model GG vs. TT+TG: OR = 0.81, 95%CI = 0.75-0.88). In the stratified analysis by populations, the effect was remain in studies of Asian population (homozygote comparison: OR = 0.71, 95%CI = 0.63-0.79; heterozygote comparison: OR = 0.86, 95 %CI = 0.79- 0.94; dominant model: OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.74 -0.87 and recessive model: OR = 0.78, 95%CI = 0.71-0.86). Moreover, a significantly decreased risk was found in lung cancer studies (homozygote comparison: OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.59-0.79; heterozygote comparison: OR = 0.86, 95%CI = 0.77- 0.98; dominant model: OR = 0.80, 95%CI = 0.72-0.90 and recessive model: OR= 0.77, 95% CI= 0.68-0.87). These findings support that APE1 rs1760944 polymorphism has a possible protective effect on cancer susceptibility particularly among Asians. Further studies based on different ethnicity and various cancer types are warranted to verify our findings."
24667663,24667663,Dual effect of a polymorphism in the macrophage migration inhibitory factor gene is associated with new-onset Graves disease in a Taiwanese Chinese population.,"Graves disease (GD) is an autoimmune disease. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a potent cytokine that plays an important role in the regulation of immune responses. Two polymorphisms in the promoter region of MIF, rs5844572 and rs755622, are known to affect MIF expression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between polymorphisms in the MIF gene promoter and the severity of GD. A total of 677 individuals, including 481 GD patients and 196 ethnically matched healthy controls, were genotyped to identify differences in the distribution of the MIF polymorphisms rs5844572 and rs755622. Although there were no significant differences in the allele or genotype distributions among patients with different grades of goiter in GD and healthy controls, the distribution of the C allele, especially C/C genotype, of the rs755622 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in MIF, may be as a risk factor for goiter initiation whereas a protector against development of severe goiter in patients with untreated GD (p<0.05). A goiter-developmental model incorporating genetic (MIF SNP rs755622) and environmental risk factors (gender, radioiodine treatment, thyroid gland surgery and vitiligo) significantly increased the prediction accuracy. Further studies are required to address the role of MIF polymorphisms, as well as their association with other candidate genes, in GD."
24668548,24668548,Susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma in the Chinese population--associations with interleukin-6 receptor polymorphism.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most deadly malignant diseases in the world. Genetic variations in cytokine genes may have an effect on the immune and inflammatory responses which are associated with HBV-HCC. The interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor is known to be mainly expressed by hepatocytes, neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and some lymphocytes, which have been used as prognostic markers in a variety of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and Crohn's disease. To determine the association of IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) polymorphism with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in the Chinese population, a hospital based case-control study was designed consisting of 192 subjects with HCC and 192 healthy control subjects. Our results revealed no risk associations (p = 0.064) with rs6684439 CT genotypes. However, rs6684439 TT genotypes were associated with a significantly decreased risk of HBV-related HCC compared with the CC genotype (odds ratio (OR) = 0.469, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.228-0.967, p = 0.040). The data also revealed that subjects with the T allele appeared to have a lower susceptibility to HBV-related HCC than those with the C allele (OR = 0.657, 95 % CI 0.476-0.907, p = 0.011). The present study supports the view that variants in the rs6684439 SNP of IL-6R is associated with a lower risk of HBV-related HCC, and this could provide valuable clues to understanding the mechanisms underlying susceptibility to this malignant disease. Replication and further functional studies should be carried out in the future using larger samples."
24648966,24648966,Association of ADAM33 gene polymorphisms with asthma in the Uygur population of China.,"Asthma is one of the most common chronic respiratory diseases, affecting ∼300 million children and adults worldwide. Previous studies identified a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain 33 (ADAM33) as an important susceptibility gene for asthma in patients of different nationalities; however, it is unknown whether this relationship exists in ethnically diverse populations. The present study focused on the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ADAM33 gene and asthma in the Uygur population of China. Three SNPs of ADAM33 (T1, S+1 and F+1) were genotyped in a case-control study among the Chinese Uygur population, involving 126 adult asthmatic patients and 126 healthy controls. The frequency of the ADAM33 T1 C allele among asthma patients was significantly higher compared to healthy controls (20.6 vs. 11.1%, P=0.003). The distribution of ADAM33 genotypes differed significantly between the two groups. The frequency of the T1 TC genotype was higher among patients compared to healthy controls [odds ratio (OR)=2.118, P=0.016] and the variant genotype, TC+CC, increased the risk of asthma (OR=2.244, P=0.005).

24643394,24643394,Association of variants in 21q22 with ankylosing spondylitis in the Chinese Guangxi Zhuang population.,"Genome-wide association study has reported a number of genes as being associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in Caucasian European populations and Chinese Han population. The aim of the study was to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering the 21q22 region are associated with AS in the Chinese Guangxi Zhuang population. A case-control study was performed in unrelated patients with AS (n = 315) and age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched controls (n = 630) from Guangxi Zhuang ethnic group. All patients met the modified New York criteria for AS. TaqMan genotyping assay was used to genotype cases and controls for 17 tag SNPs covering 21q22. After multiple-testing correction, significant association with AS was not observed in all SNP, but one block haplotype was significantly associated with AS. The pairwise analysis of the rs8126528/rs2150414/rs6517532 alleles found that the G-A-A haplotype (OR 2.92, 95 % CI 1.48-3.55; p = 0.0002, permuted p = 0.0332) significantly increased the risk of AS in comparison with the G-A-G, A-A-A and G-G-A carriers. In conclusion, the study results define a novel risk haplotypes in 21q22 that was associated with AS in the Chinese Guangxi Zhuang population. The findings was consistent with previous genetic and functional studies that point at variants of the BRWD1 and/or PSMG1 loci as interesting genetic factors contributing to AS."
24648396,24648396,"Association study between polymorphisms of PRMT6, PEX10, SOX5, and nonobstructive azoospermia in the Han Chinese population.","A previous genomewide association study of nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) in the Han Chinese population identified three risk loci (rs12097821, rs2477686, and rs10842262) and provided strong evidence for a genetic influence in male infertility. However, recently, a follow-up study of these single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci in the Japanese population showed that none of them were significantly associated with NOA. Therefore, we conducted an association study, consisting of 550 NOA cases and 555 normal controls, to further validate whether the risk of those three SNPs still existed in an independent Han Chinese male population. The association studies did not support the association of rs12097821 and rs2477686 with NOA for both genotype and allele distributions, but rs10842262 in the SOX5 gene was significantly associated with NOA (chi square = 9.31; P = 0.0095 and chi square = 9.27; P = 0.0023, respectively). Our study provides genetic evidence for SOX5 polymorphism in NOA, contributing to predicting males at high risk of NOA in Han Chinese population. Considering genetic differences among populations, future validating studies in independent samples are suggested."
24633486,24633486,"Effect of SNP polymorphisms of EDN1, EDNRA, and EDNRB gene on ischemic stroke.","The objective of this study is to investigate the association between SNP polymorphisms of endothelin-1 (EDN1) and endothelin receptor (EDNRA and EDNRB) gene and ischemic stroke (IS) in the Chinese Han population in northern. A case-control study was introduced. We genotyped eight SNPs (rs1800541, rs2070699, and rs5370 in EDN1 gene; rs1801708, rs5333, and rs5335 in EDNRA gene; and rs3818416 and rs5351 in EDNRB gene) and calculated their polymorphic distribution in control group, IS group, and the IS subgroups. In male population, EDN1 gene rs2070699 G allele increased the incidence risk to 1.78 times (P = 0.009; OR 1.78; 95 % CI 1.15-2.75) and the risk of morbidity of rs5370 T allele carrying increased to 1.49 times (P = 0.048; OR 1.49; 95 % CI 1.00-2.21). EDNRA gene mutation rs5335 homozygous CC morbidity risk was significantly lower (P = 0.016; OR 0.52; 95 % CI 0.31-0.88). In the female population, the mutant homozygous AA cancer risk was significantly higher than G allele carriers (P = 0.019; OR 2.65; 95 % CI 1.18-6.00) on EDNRA gene rs1801708. In EDN1 gene, T allele of rs5370 and G allele of rs2070699 may be IS incidence risk factors in Northern Han male population. A allele of rs1801708 in EDNRA gene can increase the risk of IS in Northern Han women population."
24642721,24642721,The common single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2681472 is associated with early-onset preeclampsia in Northern Han Chinese women.,"Preeclampsia, characterized by hypertension and proteinuria, remains a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified the single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs2681472, as a new hypertension susceptibility genetic variant. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between preeclampsia and rs268172 in a Northern Han Chinese population. We genotyped 1218 unrelated Northern Han Chinese women, including 515 patients with preeclampsia and 703 healthy controls. No significant differences were detected in the allele frequencies between patients and controls (P = .23). When patients were divided into early-onset and late-onset preeclampsia according to gestational age of disease onset, the allele frequencies significantly differed between controls and patients with early-onset preeclampsia (P = .02). Genotype frequencies also were significantly different between controls and patients early-onset preeclampsia when data were analyzed under additive (P = .03) and dominant (P = .009) models. We replicated this association in an independent Northern Han Chinese population and observed a significant difference in the allele frequencies between patients with early-onset preeclampsia and controls (P = .011). We report that rs2681472 is associated with early-onset preeclampsia in Northern Han Chinese women."
24637646,24637646,Cross-sectional and longitudinal replication analyses of genome-wide association loci of type 2 diabetes in Han Chinese.,"This study aimed to examine genomic loci of type 2 diabetes (T2D) initially identified by genome-wide association studies in populations of European ancestry for their associations with T2D and quantitative glycemic traits, as well as their effects on longitudinal change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and T2D development, in the Chinese population. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from 25 loci were genotyped in a large case-control sample of 10,001 subjects (5,338 T2D cases and 4,663 controls) and a prospective cohort of 1,881 Chinese. In the case-control sample, 8 SNPs in or near WFS1, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B, CDC123, HHEX, TCF7L2, KCNQ1, and MTNR1B were significantly associated with T2D (P<0.05). Thirteen SNPs were associated with quantitative glycemic traits. For example, the most significant SNP, rs10811661 near CDKN2A/2B (P = 1.11×10(-8) for T2D), was also associated with 2-h glucose level of an oral glucose tolerance test (P = 9.11×10(-3)) and insulinogenic index (P = 2.71×10(-2)). In the cohort study, individuals carrying more risk alleles of the replicated SNPs had greater FPG increase and T2D incidence in a 7.5-year follow-up period, with each quartile increase in the number of risk alleles being associated with a 0.06 mmol/l greater increase in FPG (P = 0.03) and 19% higher odds of developing T2D (P = 0.058). Our study identified the associations of several established T2D-loci in Europeans with T2D and quantitative glycemic traits in the Chinese population. The prospective data also suggest their potential role in the risk prediction of T2D in the Chinese population."
24667323,24667323,A novel functional TagSNP Rs7560488 in the DNMT3A1 promoter is associated with susceptibility to gastric cancer by modulating promoter activity.,"DNA-methyltransferase (DNMT)-3A which contains DNMT3A1 and DNMT3A2 isoforms have been suggested to play a crucial role in carcinogenesis and showed aberrant expression in most cancers. Accumulated evidences also indicated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in DNMT genes were associated with susceptibility to different tumors. We hypothesized that genetic variants in DNMT3A1 promoter region are associated with gastric cancer risk. We selected the tagSNPs from the HapMap database for the Chinese and genotyped in a case-control study to evaluate the association with gastric cancer (GC) in a Chinese population. We identified that the functional tagSNP rs7560488 T>C associated with a significantly increased risk of GC. In vitro functional analysis by luciferase reporter assay and EMSA indicated that the tagSNP rs7560488 T>C substantially altered transcriptional activity of DNMT3A1 gene via influencing the binding of some transcriptional factors, although a definite transcriptional factor remains to be established. Compared with TT homozygotes, subjects who were TC heterozygotes and CC homozygotes exhibited a reduced expression of DNMT3A1. Furthermore, stratified analysis showed that individuals who harbor TC or CC genotypes less than 60 years old were more susceptible to GC. Our results suggest that the genetic variations in the DNMT3A1 promoter contribute to the susceptibility to GC and also provide an insight that tagSNP rs7560488 T>C may be a promising biomarker for predicting GC genetic susceptibility and a valuable information in GC pathogenesis."
24649901,24649901,Genetic variants of 17q21 are associated with childhood-onset asthma and related phenotypes in a northeastern Han Chinese population: a case-control study.,"A genome-wide association study (GWAS) suggested that variants on chromosome 17q21 were associated with childhood-onset asthma in white populations. Two replication studies had been conducted in southern Han Chinese population in 2009 and 2012. However, these two Chinese replication results were inconsistent. To further confirm the role of 17q21 common variants, an association study of 17q21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the risk of childhood-onset asthma was performed in a Han population from northeastern China. In this study, rs3894194, rs12603332 and rs11650680 were genotyped in 435 asthmatic children and 601 healthy controls by using a SNaPshot method. Our data showed that the allelic frequency of rs12603332 and rs11650680 showed significant differences between asthmatic cases and healthy controls, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.36 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-1.65, P=0.002] and an OR of 1.36 (95% CI 1.07-1.74, P=0.01). Genotype distribution analysis also showed the significant associations of the above two loci with childhood asthma under dominant, recessive and additive model (dominant OR=1.57, 95% CI 1.04-2.36, P=0.032; recessive OR=1.41, 95% CI 1.09-1.83, P=0.009; additive OR=1.97, 95% CI 1.24-3.14, P=0.004; recessive OR=1.50, 95% CI 1.13-1.98, P=0.005). Besides, linear regression analysis showed that rs3894194 and rs12603332 were also significantly associated with asthma phenotypes such as log10 -transformed immunoglobulin E (IgE) level (IU/ml) and log10 -transformed eosinophil percentage (dominant, P=0.04; additive, P=0.01; recessive, P=0.04; recessive, P=0.03; additive, P=0.02). Collectively, our findings suggest that orosomucoid 1-like 3 (ORMDL3) locus on chromosome 17q21 is a risk factor for childhood-onset asthma in northeastern Han Chinese population. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the pathogenesis that ORMDL3 locus predisposes to childhood-onset asthma."

24635845,24635845,The genetic variation of ARRB2 is associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Han Chinese.,"Emerging evidence indicates that β-arrestin 2, an important regulator of G protein coupled receptors, is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between β-arrestin 2 gene (ARRB2) variation and the risk of late-onset AD (LOAD). A total of 1132 LOAD patients and 1158 healthy controls from the Han Chinese population were included in this study. Initially, four common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs3786047, rs16954146, rs1045280 and rs2271167) were selected by consulting the Han Chinese from Beijing genotype data in HapMap database. Considering the fact that these four SNPs were located in one haplotype block and any two of them were in almost complete linkage disequilibrium (D'=1, r2≥0.897), we chose rs1045280 (a coding- synonymous variant) that covered all the common genetic variations in ARRB2 with r2≥0.8 as the tag SNP (tSNP) for the subsequent genotyping. Our results showed that the minor allele of rs1045280 was associated with an increased LOAD risk after adjusting for age, gender, educational level, and the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status under dominant (OR=1.291; 95% CI: 1.063-1.568; Bonferroni-corrected P=0.03) and additive (OR=1.269; 95% CI: 1.069-1.507; Bonferroni- corrected P=0.018) models. Meanwhile, when these data were stratified by APOE ε4 status, this association was evident only in APOE ε4 carriers (OR=1.617; 95% CI: 1.01-2.588; P=0.045). In summary, this study provide the first evidence that the tSNP of ARRB2 significantly increases LOAD risk in Han Chinese, suggesting ARRB2 may represent a susceptibility gene for LOAD."
24615081,24615081,Association of XRCC5 polymorphisms with COPD and COPD-related phenotypes in the Han Chinese population: a case-control cohort study.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and integrative genomic approaches have demonstrated significant associations between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and polymorphisms of the X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 5 gene (XRCC5) in non-Asian populations. We investigated whether XRCC5 polymorphisms might be associated with COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes in the Chinese Han population. Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs3821104, rs12470053, rs207936, rs3770498, rs6704622, rs3770492, rs4674066, rs7573191, and rs207906) in the XRCC5 gene were genotyped in a case-control study including 680 COPD patients and 687 controls. To estimate the strength of association, odds ratios (ORs) were calculated and the effects of potentially confounding variables were tested by logistic regression analysis. The association between haplotypes and COPD outcome was also assessed. Our data identified that the SNP rs207936 was associated with COPD with an adjusted P value of 0.038, which was also found when analyzing only data of current smokers (P=0.046). No significant associations were found between any of the SNPs and pulmonary function. Eight SNPs (rs3821104, rs12470053, rs207936, rs3770498, rs6704622, rs3770492, rs4674066, and rs7573191) showed strong linkage disequilibrium (R2≥0.9). Two major haplotypes were observed and showed a significant difference between case and control groups (P=0.0054 and 0.0081, respectively). The present study showed that the XRCC5 locus might be a contributor to COPD susceptibility in the Chinese Han population."

24607942,24607942,Is GSN significant for hip BMD in female Caucasians?,"Low bone mineral density (BMD) is a risk factor for osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is more prevalent in females than in males. So far, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying osteoporosis are unclear. Peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) are precursors of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. This study aims to identify PBM-expressed proteins (genes) influencing hip BMD in humans. We utilized three independent study cohorts (N=34, 29, 40), including premenopausal Caucasians with discordant hip BMD. We studied PBM proteome-wide protein expression profiles in cohort 1 and identified 57 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between low vs. high BMD subjects. One protein gelsolin (GSN), after validation by Western blotting, was subject to follow-up. We compared GSN mRNA level in PBM between low vs. high BMD subjects in cohorts 2 and 3. We genotyped SNPs across GSN in 2286 unrelated Caucasians (cohort 4) and 1627 Chinese (cohort 5) and tested their association with hip BMD in females and males, respectively. We discovered and validated that GSN protein expression level in PBM was down-regulated 3.0-fold in low vs. high BMD subjects (P<0.05). Down-regulation of GSN in PBM in low BMD subjects was also observed at mRNA level in both cohort 2 and cohort 3. We identified that SNP rs767770 was significantly associated with hip BMD in female Caucasians (P=0.0003) only. Integrating analyses of the datasets at DNA, RNA, and protein levels from female Caucasians substantiated that GSN is highly significant for hip BMD (P=0.0001). We conclude that GSN is a significant gene influencing hip BMD in female Caucasians."
24615024,24615024,MKL1-184C>T gene polymorphism is associated with coronary artery disease in the Chinese Han population.,"We investigated genetic susceptibility to coronary artery disease (CAD) by studying the association of MKL1 gene polymorphisms with CAD in the Chinese Han population. We performed a case-control study with 476 unrelated CAD patients and 325 non-CAD controls. All SNPs were genotyped with a TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. The distribution of MKL1-184C>T gene polymorphism in each group was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The frequency of the MKL1 T allele in the CAD group was significantly higher than in the control group (38.6 vs 30.8%). After logistic regression models adjusted for CAD risk factors, the risk of CAD among CT genotypes was 1.765 times higher than among the CC genotypes [odds ration (OR) = 1.765, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.246-2.5], and for TT genotypes it was 1.806 times higher than for the CC genotypes (OR = 1.806, 95%CI = 1.203-2.71). In summary, genotypes with at least one T allele (CT or TT genotypes) had a significantly increased CAD risk than the CC genotypes, with a ratio of 1.78 to 1 (OR = 1.780, 95%CI = 1.311-2.418). There was a close association between -184 T allele and 3VD (OR = 1.614, 95%CI = 1.259-2.07, P < 0.05). We conclude that the -184C>T of MKL1 is an important susceptibility factor for CAD in the Han Chinese in Henan Province. Homozygosity for the T allele is not only associated with an increased risk for CAD, it is also correlated with severity of stenosis in the Chinese Han population."

A meta-analysis of datasets from five Parkinson's disease GWAS from the USA and Europe found 11 loci that surpassed the threshold for genome-wide significance (p<5×10(-8)), and five were newly identified loci (ACMSD, STK39, MCCC1/LAMP3, SYT11 and CCDC62/HIP1R). Another GWAS of the Ashkenazi Jewish population also identified loci in STK39 and LAMP3. Because the association between the STK39 and MCCC1/LAMP3 genes and PD was confirmed in different populations, we conducted a case-control cohort to clarify the association between the four single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci (rs2102808 and rs3754775 in the STK39; rs11711441 and rs12493050 in the MCCC1/LAMP3) and PD in the Chinese Han population. Polymerase chain reaction and direct DNA sequencing analyses were used to detect the four variations in a case-control cohort comprised of 993 ethnic Chinese subjects. We found that in the detection of the rs11711441, there was a significant difference between ungrouped populations, early-onset PD, late-onset PD, male PD, female PD and the corresponding control group in allele and genotype frequency (p<0.001, OR<1). In the detection of the rs2102808, rs3754775 and rs12493050, ungrouped populations, early-onset PD, late-onset PD, male PD or female PD with the corresponding control group showed no significant difference in allele and genotype frequency (p>0.0125). Our findings suggested that the allele G of rs11711441 of the MCCC1/LAMP3 gene can decrease the risk of PD in Chinese population. No statistically significant difference in genotype frequency between cases and controls was observed for the other three SNPs."

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SLC22A4 gene have been previously reported to be associated with RA in Japanese but not European populations. This study further investigated the association of SLC22A4 polymorphisms, in particular slc2F1/slc2F2, with RA in the Chinese population, the largest Asian population. A total of 160 human subjects with 95 RA patients and 65 healthy controls were genotyped for slc2F1-G/A and slc2F2-C/T polymorphisms. The results showed that there was a significant difference in the genotype distribution of these two polymorphisms between the two groups. In addition, the presence of slc2F1 A allele and slc2F2 T allele carries a 1.93-fold and 2.14-fold increased risk for anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) positivity, respectively. Overall, this study provided evidence that SLC22A4 gene polymorphisms played important roles in the etiology of RA in the largest Asian population, the Chinese population."

The present study was performed in order to detect the association between the rs7134375 SNP and serum lipid levels in the Guangxi Mulao and Han populations. The genotypes of the PDE3A rs7134375 SNP in 761 subjects of the Mulao population and 774 subjects of the Han Chinese population were determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism combined with gel electrophoresis, and then confirmed by direct sequencing. It was observed that serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels were higher in the Mulao population than in the Han population (P<0.05 for each). The frequencies of the C and A alleles were 72.14 and 27.86% in the Mulao population, and 78.55 and 21.45% in the Han population (P<0.01), respectively. The frequencies of the CC, CA and AA genotypes were 52.04, 40.21 and 7.75% in the Mulao population, and 61.50, 34.11 and 4.39% in the Han population (P<0.01), respectively. The frequencies of the C and A alleles were 74.89 and 25.11% in Mulao females, and 68.08 and 31.92% in Mulao males (P<0.01), respectively. The serum triglyceride (TG) levels were different among the genotypes in the Mulao population; however, not in the Han population (P<0.01), and the A allele carriers exhibited lower TG levels than the A allele noncarriers. The serum lipid parameters were also correlated with several environmental factors in the two ethnic groups (P<0.05-0.001). It was concluded that the genotypic and allelic frequencies of the rs7134375 SNP are different between the Mulao and Han populations.

To date, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11190870 was identified as the most significant common variant in Japanese females. Three association studies conducted in Chinese Han population from Hong Kong, Yangtze River region and Southern region of mainland China replicated the association between AIS and rs1190870. However, there is limited published data about the association of rs11190870 with AIS in East Asian population.Methods. A systematic search of all relevant studies published through Aug 2013 was conducted using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, OVID, and ScienceDirect. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of rs11190870 was evaluated. The included studies were assessed in the analysis of the following allele model: T-allele versus C-allele for the allele level comparison; (b) TC+TT versus CC for dominant model of T-allele; (c) TT versus TC+CC for recessive model of T-allele, and (d) TT versus CC for extreme genotype.Results. Four studies with 8415 total participants (2889 AIS patients and 5526 controls), which were all East Asian population were eligible for inclusion. We searched for genotypes T allele vs. C allele, TT vs. TC+ CC, TC + TT vs. CC and TT vs. CC in a fixed/random-effects model. The effect summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained, which shows significant association between rs11190870 and AIS in East Asian populations (All genetic models P<0.001). Subgroup group analyses were conducted according to the gender. The results showed that a significant association between rs11190870 and AIS in female (All genetic models P<0.001), but not in male (All genetic models P>0.05).Conclusion.

Genetic factors might play an important role in the carcinogenesis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We conducted a hospital-based case-control study to evaluate ten NAT2 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the risk of ESCC. Six hundred and twenty-nine ESCC cases and 686 controls were recruited. Their genotypes were determined using the ligation detection reaction method. In the single locus analyses, there was a borderline statistically significant difference in genotype frequencies of NAT2 rs1565684 T>C SNP between the cases and the controls (p = 0.057). The NAT2 rs1565684 CC genotype was associated with a borderline significantly increased risk for ESCC (CC vs. TT: adjusted OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 0.97-3.21, p = 0.063 and CC vs. TT/TC: adjusted OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 0.93-3.04, p = 0.085). The association was evident among older patients and patients who never drunk. After the Bonferroni correction, in all comparison models, NAT2 rs1565684 T>C SNP was not associated with ESCC risk (p>0.05). For the other nine NAT2 SNPs, after Bonferroni correction, in all comparison models, the nine SNPs were also not associated with ESCC risk (p>0.05). Thus, nine NAT2 tagging SNPs were not associated with risk of ESCC. NAT2 rs1565684 T>C SNP might play a slight role in ESCC etiology. Additional, larger studies and tissue-specific biological characterization are required to confirm the current findings."

24530755,24530755,Genetic polymorphism of interleukin-6 influences susceptibility to HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma in a male Chinese Han population.,"As a multifunctional cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a key role in chronic inflammation as well as tumor growth and progression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Recent studies have implicated that single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -572C>G (rs1800796) located within the promoter region of IL-6 gene was associated with susceptibility to several diseases. Here, a case-control study was undertaken to investigate the association between this polymorphism and HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) susceptibility in a Chinese Han population. A total of 900 patients with chronic HBV infection, including 505 HBV-related HCC patients and 395 HBV infected patients without HCC were enrolled, and rs1800796 polymorphism was genotyped by the TaqMan method and DNA sequencing technology. The results indicated no significant association between rs1800796 polymorphism and the risk of HBV-related HCC in all subjects; however, a significant difference was identified in male subjects. Under the dominant model, male subjects with the G allele (CG/GG) have higher susceptibility to HBV-related HCC than those with CC genotype after adjusting confounding factors (P=0.012, odds ratio [OR] 1.68, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.15-2.42).

24562863,24562863,DNA mismatch repair MSH2 gene-based SNP associated with different populations.,"We screened for the major essential single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant that might be associated with the MSH2 gene based on the data available from three types of human tissue samples [156 lymphoblastoid cell variations (LCL), 160 epidermis, 166 fat]. An association analysis confirmed that the KCNK12 SNP variant (rs748780) was highly associated (p value 9 × 10(-4)) with the MSH2 gene for all three samples. Using SNP identification, we further found that the recognized SNP was also relevant among Hapmap populations. Techniques that display specific SNPs associated with the gene of interest or nearby genes provide more reliable genetic associations than techniques that rely on data from individual SNPs. We investigated the MSH2 gene regional linkage association with the determined SNP (rs748780), KCNK12 variant (Allele T>C) in the intronic region, in HapMap3 full dataset populations, Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI), Utah residents with ancestry from northern Europe (CEU), Han Chinese in Beijing, China (CHB), and a population of Mexican ancestry in Los Angeles, California (MEX). A gene-based SNP association analysis analyzes the combined impact of every variant within the gene while creating referrals to linkage disequilibrium or connections between markers. Our results indicated that among the four populations studied, this association was highest in the MEX population based on the r(2) value; a similar pattern was also observed in the other three populations. The relevant SNP rs748780 in KCNK12 is related to a superfamily of potassium channel pore-forming P-domain proteins as well as to other non-pore-forming proteins and has been shown to be relevant to neurological disorder predisposition in MEX as well as in other populations."

24503183,24503183,A potentially functional polymorphism in the promoter region of miR-34b/c is associated with renal cell cancer risk in a Chinese population.,"Members of the miR-34 family have been shown to be transcriptional targets of the tumour suppressor gene P53. Aberration expression of miR-34 impairs p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. A single nucleotide polymorphism T > C (rs4938723) located within the CpG island in the promoter region of pri-miR-34b/c may affect its expression and has been suggested to influence cancer risk. In this study, we genotyped rs4938723 using the TaqMan method to explore the relationship between this polymorphism and the risk of renal cell cancer (RCC) in a case-control study of 710 RCC patients and 760 control subjects. We found that individuals carrying the CC genotype had a significantly increased RCC risk compared with those with TT or TT/TC genotypes [odds ratio (OR) = 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.06-2.21 for CC vs. TT and OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.05-2.10 for CC vs. TT/TC). Furthermore, the increased risk was more evident in the subgroups of older subjects (OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.08-3.01), males (OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.08-2.51), smokers (OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.16-3.69) and drinkers (OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.01-3.73), although no interaction between rs4938723 and these characteristics was observed. Twenty-seven normal tissues adjacent to tumour were used to evaluate the association between the expression level of miR-34b/c and the polymorphism, which revealed higher expression levels of miR-34b/c in normal renal tissues with TT+TC genotypes than in those with CC genotypes (P < 0.01). Furthermore, a luciferase gene assay in 293-T cells showed that the luciferase activities with rs4938723 T allele are higher than that with C allele (P < 0.05). These results suggest that the miR-34b/c rs4938723 C allele may increase susceptibility to RCC by decreasing the activity of pri-miR-34b/c promoter."

24490137,24490137,Integrated mRNA and microRNA transcriptome sequencing characterizes sequence variants and mRNA-microRNA regulatory network in nasopharyngeal carcinoma model systems.,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a prevalent malignancy in Southeast Asia among the Chinese population. Aberrant regulation of transcripts has been implicated in many types of cancers including NPC. Herein, we characterized mRNA and miRNA transcriptomes by RNA sequencing (RNASeq) of NPC model systems. Matched total mRNA and small RNA of undifferentiated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive NPC xenograft X666 and its derived cell line C666, well-differentiated NPC cell line HK1, and the immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line NP460 were sequenced by Solexa technology. We found 2812 genes and 149 miRNAs (human and EBV) to be differentially expressed in NP460, HK1, C666 and X666 with RNASeq; 533 miRNA-mRNA target pairs were inversely regulated in the three NPC cell lines compared to NP460. Integrated mRNA/miRNA expression profiling and pathway analysis show extracellular matrix organization, Beta-1 integrin cell surface interactions, and the PI3K/AKT, EGFR, ErbB, and Wnt pathways were potentially deregulated in NPC. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed on selected mRNA/miRNAs in order to validate their expression. Transcript sequence variants such as short insertions and deletions (INDEL), single nucleotide variant (SNV), and isomiRs were characterized in the NPC model systems. A novel TP53 transcript variant was identified in NP460, HK1, and C666. Detection of three previously reported novel EBV-encoded BART miRNAs and their isomiRs were also observed. Meta-analysis of a model system to a clinical system aids the choice of different cell lines in NPC studies. This comprehensive characterization of mRNA and miRNA transcriptomes in NPC cell lines and the xenograft provides insights on miRNA regulation of mRNA and valuable resources on transcript variation and regulation in NPC, which are potentially useful for mechanistic and preclinical studies."

24498053,24498053,Metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 is associated with heroin dependence but not depression or schizophrenia in a Chinese population.,"Metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 3 (mGluR3, encoded by GRM3) plays important roles in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, depression, and drug dependence. GRM3 polymorphisms were reported to be associated with prefrontal activity, cognitive shifting, and memory capability in healthy subjects, as well as susceptibility to schizophrenia and depression. The goal of this study was to replicate the association of GRM3 with schizophrenia and depression and to explore GRM3's potential association with heroin dependence (HD) in a Chinese population. Seventeen SNPs throughout the GRM3 gene were genotyped using MALDI-TOF within the MassARRAY system, and the allele and genotype distributions were compared between 619 healthy controls and 433 patients with schizophrenia, 409 patients with major depression, and 584 unrelated addicts. We found that GRM3 polymorphisms modulate the susceptibility to HD but do not significantly influence the risk for schizophrenia or depression. An increased risk of HD was significantly associated with the minor alleles of two GRM3 SNPs, including the T allele of rs274618 (Odds ratio (OR) = 1.631, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.317-2.005), the T allele of rs274622 (OR = 1.652, 95% CI: 1.336-2.036), compared with the major alleles. The addicts carrying the minor allele of rs274618 or rs274622 had a shortened duration for transition from first use to dependence (DTFUD) in comparison to homozygote for major allele (P<0.0001 for each SNP using log rank test). Additionally, a 6-SNP haplotype within 5' region of the GRM3 including the minor alleles of the two aforementioned SNPs was significantly associated with an increased risk of HD (P = 0.00001, OR = 1.668, 95% CI: 1.335-2.084). Our data indicated that GRM3 polymorphisms do not contribute to genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia and depression, but they confer an increased risk of HD in a Chinese population."

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with bone mineral density (BMD), fracture, vertebral fracture, bone turnover or 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] in 1,753 randomly selected postmenopausal women in China. Vertebral fracture, BMD of lumbar spine (2-4), femoral neck and total hip were measured respectively. Serum N-terminal procollagen of type 1 collagen (P1NP), β-isomerized type I collagen C-telopeptide breakdown products (β-CTX) and 25(OH)D3 were also determined. Binary logistic regression revealed significant associations between fracture risk with rs1999805 (P=0.041, OR 1.633, 95%CI 1.020-2.616) and rs6929137 (P=0.005, OR 1.932, 95%CI 1.226-3.045) in recessive model. Significant association was also observed between vertebral fracture risk and rs1038304 (P=0.039, OR 0.549, 95%CI 0.311-0.969) in recessive model. Liner regression analyses showed that only the CC group of rs4870044 was significantly associated with total hip in dominant model (P=0.034).

24469730,24469730,Genetic association of the P-glycoprotein gene ABCB1 polymorphisms with the risk for steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head in Chinese population.,"Steroid administration, which is commonly performed for the treatment of autoimmune inflammatory diseases, cancers or organ transplantation, has been a leading cause of nontraumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette B1 (ABCB1) gene have been demonstrated to be related to steroid-induced ONFH in small sample sizes of Japanese kidney failure and Chinese systemic lupus erythematosus patients. However, there are obvious controversial results in the relationship of ABCB1 gene polymorphisms with steroid-induced ONFH. The aim of this study was to validate the genetic association of ABCB1 polymorphisms with the risk for steroid-induced ONFH in a large cohort of Chinese population. A case-control study was conducted, which included 94 and 106 unrelated patients after steroid administration recruited from 14 provinces in China, respectively. Two SNPs (rs1045642 and rs2032582) within ABCB1 were genotyped using Sequenom MassARRAY system. Multivariate analyses based on clinical information were performed to determine the associations between the SNPs and risk of steroid-induced ONFH. rs1045642 SNP was significantly associated with steroid-induced ONFH group in codominant (P=0.02), recessive (P=0.006) and overdominant (P=0.03) models. However, there were no differences found in genotype frequencies of rs2032582 SNP between controls and patients with steroid-induced ONFH (all P>0.05). These findings suggested that rs1045642 SNP of ABCB1 may be associated with the risk of steroid-induced ONFH. Thus, it is useful to analyze this polymorphism for identifying high-risk individuals before the administration of steroids."

The rs2736100 SNP was found to be associated with susceptibility to many cancers. Recently, inhibition of telomerase and marked telomere shortening were determined to be closely associated with the increasing severity of atherosclerosis. The association between the SNP of rs2736100 and the presence of atherosclerosis was evaluated in 84 atherosclerosis patients and 257 healthy controls using multivariate logistic regression analyses. The proportion of the GG genotype in atherosclerosis patients (17.9%) was significantly higher than in the control group (9.7%). Eight variables, including age, gender, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, homocysteine, total bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, and rs2736100 GG genotype, were associated with atherosclerosis with odds ratios of 1.88, 2.11, 1.66, 0.23, 1.27, 1.29, 1.53, and 1.74, respectively, using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Homozygous GG was demonstrated to be associated with the presence of atherosclerosis in our population."
24486888,24486888,The SORL1 polymorphism rs985421 may confer the risk for amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in the Han Chinese population.,"Although the pathogenetic mechanisms driving Alzheimer's disease (AD) are unclear, genetic variations may play an important role. Previous studies have identified that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the sortilin-related receptor, L (DLR class) A repeats containing (SORL1) gene are associated with AD or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients. However, the association of SORL1 variants with AD or aMCI susceptibility in the Han Chinese population has not been adequately reported. Thus, we conducted a case-control study in 106 sporadic AD patients, 67 aMCI patients, and 179 healthy control Han Chinese subjects to determine whether SORL1 genetic variations alter the risk for AD or aMCI. Using the LDR-PCR method to genotype five polymorphisms in SORL1, we found significant associations (for AD: OR=1.968, 95% CI=1.273-3.042; for aMCI: OR=2.210, 95% CI=1.353-3.610) between the 'A' allele of the SORL1 SNP rs985421 and AD and aMCI, which may represent an ApoE ɛ4-independent risk factor for SAD. These findings suggest that the SORL1 SNP rs985421 may alter the risk for sporadic AD and aMCI in the Han Chinese population."

This study investigated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) and inducible T-cell co-stimulator-ligand gene (ICOSLG) in Chinese Han BD patients and healthy controls because SNPs of these two genes are associated with risk of developing other auto-inflammation diseases."
24460302,24460302,Lack of association of common polymorphisms in MUC1 gene with H. pylori infection and non-cardia gastric cancer risk in a Chinese population.,"Several lines of evidence support the notion that MUC1 is often aberrantly expressed in gastric cancer, and it is a ligand for Helicobacter pylori. Genetic variation in MUC1 gene may confer susceptibility to H. pylori infection and gastric cancer. We assessed the association of common polymorphisms in MUC1 gene with H. pylori infection and non-cardia gastric cancer using an LD-based tag SNP approach in north-western Chinese Han population. A total of four SNPs were successfully genotyped among 288 patients with non-cardia gastric cancer and 281 age- and sex-matched controls. None of the tested SNPs was associated with H. pylori infection. SNP rs9426886 was associated with a decreased risk of non-cardia gastric cancer, but lost significance after adjustment for multiple testing. Overall, our data indicated that common genetic variations in MUC1 gene might not make a major contribution to the risk of H. pylori infection and non-cardia gastric cancer in our studied population."
24463336,24463336,Association of interleukin-4 genetic polymorphisms with sporadic Alzheimer's disease in Chinese Han population.,"Cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to evaluate the potential association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of IL-4 gene and AD susceptibility. This case-control study was conducted in Chinese Han populations consisting of 203 AD patients and 205 controls. Three common SNPs of IL-4 gene, including -590C>T (rs2243250), -33C>T (rs2070874), and -1098T>G (rs2243248), were determined by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and verified using DNA sequencing methods. Our data show that -590C and -1098G alleles of IL-4 were more common in AD patients (30.5% vs 22.2% p=0.007; 14.3% vs 3.4% p<0.0001) and significantly associated with elevated risk for AD (OR=1.51 95% CI 1.05-2.23; OR=4.78 95% CI 2.37-7.67). Haplotype analysis revealed five common haplotypes CCG (OR=4.41), CCT (OR=1.22), TTT (OR=1.02), CTT (OR=0.7), and TCT (OR=0.14), from highest to lowest risk for AD. None of the associations appeared to be modified by APOE ɛ4 genetic variant. Bioinformatic analysis shows that -590C>T and -1098T>G have a linkage disequilibrium (LD) with multiple potentially functional SNPs inside IL-4 gene. Our findings indicate that the -590C and -1098G alleles located in the promoter of IL-4 may increase the susceptibility to AD among the Han Chinese and might be used as molecular markers for AD risk evaluation."

24452439,24452439,Cloning of seed dormancy genes (TaSdr) associated with tolerance to pre-harvest sprouting in common wheat and development of a functional marker.,"After cloning and mapping of wheat TaSdr genes, both the functional markers for TaSdr - B1 and TaVp - 1B were validated, and the distribution of allelic variations at TaSdr - B1 locus in the wheat cultivars from 19 countries was characterized. Seed dormancy is a major factor associated with pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Wheat TaSdr genes, orthologs of OsSdr4 conferring seed dormancy in rice, were cloned by a comparative genomics approach. They were located on homoeologous group 2 chromosomes, and designated as TaSdr-A1, TaSdr-B1 and TaSdr-D1, respectively. Sequence analysis of TaSdr-B1 revealed a SNP at the position -11 upstream of the initiation codon, with bases A and G in cultivars with low and high germination indices (GI), respectively. A cleaved amplified polymorphism sequence marker Sdr2B was developed based on the SNP, and subsequently functional analysis of TaSdr-B1 was conducted by association and linkage mapping. A QTL for GI co-segregating with Sdr2B explained 6.4, 7.8 and 8.7 % of the phenotypic variances in a RIL population derived from Yangxiaomai/Zhongyou 9507 grown in Shijiazhuang, Beijing and the averaged data from those environments, respectively. Two sets of Chinese wheat cultivars were used for association mapping, and results indicated that TaSdr-B1 was significantly associated with GI. Analysis of the allelic distribution at the TaSdr-B1 locus showed that the frequencies of TaSdr-B1a associated with a lower GI were high in cultivars from Japan, Australia, Argentina, and the Middle and Lower Yangtze Valley Winter Wheat Region and Southwest Winter Wheat Region in China. This study provides not only a reliable functional marker for molecular-assisted selection of PHS in wheat breeding programs, but also gives novel information for a comprehensive understanding of seed dormancy."
24447667,24447667,A common variant in pre-miR-146 is associated with coronary artery disease risk and its mature miRNA expression.,"miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that play an important role in numerous physiological processes. Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pre-miRNAs may change their property through altering miRNAs expression and/or maturation, resulting in diverse functional consequences. To date, the role of genetic variants in pre-miRNAs on coronary artery disease (CAD) risk remains poorly understood. Here we aimed to evaluate the influence of three common SNPs in pre-miRNAs (miR-146a rs2910164 G>C, miR-196a2 rs11614913 C>T, miR-499 rs3746444 T>C) on individual susceptibility to CAD in a Chinese population of 295 CAD patients and 283 controls. Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. In a logistic regression analysis, we detected an association of rs2910164 in pre-miR-146a with the CAD risk; compared with the GG homozygotes, the GC heterozygotes [odds ratio (OR)=1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.06-3.36, P=0.029] and the CC homozygotes (OR=1.83, 95% CI=1.01-3.32, P=0.046) genotype were statistically significantly associated with the increased risk for CADs. As we used further genotype association models, we found a similar trend of the association in recessive model (OR=1.86, 95% CI=1.09-3.19, P=0.023). We also found that the genotypes of miR-146a rs2910164 were associated with its mature miRNA expression by analyzing 23 PBMC samples from CAD patients. Individuals carrying rs11614913 GC or CC genotypes showed 3.2-fold higher expression compared to GG genotype carriers (P<0.05). We observed no association of the other two SNPs in miR-196a2 (rs11614913) and miR-499 (rs3746444) with the CAD incidence. Our data provide the first evidence that the miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism is associated with increased risk of CAD in Chinese Han population, which may be through influencing the expression levels of the miRNA."
24454457,24454457,Case-control study on the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene polymorphisms associated with breast cancer in chinese han women.,Genetic variation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) is a newly described risk factor for breast cancer.

24460263,24460263,RPSA gene mutants associated with risk of colorectal cancer among the chinese population.,"The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ribosomal protein SA (RPSA) gene with colorectal cancer (CRC). A case-control study including 388 controls and 387 patients with CRC was conducted in a Chinese population. Information about socio-demography and living behavior factors was collected by a structured questionnaire. Three SNPs (rs2133579, rs2269349, rs7641291) in RPSA gene were genotyped by Illumina SnapShot method. Multiple logistic regression models were used for assessing the joint effects between tea consumption and SNPs on CRC. The subjects with rs2269349 CC genotype had a decreased risk for CRC (OR=0.60; 95%CI = 0.37-0.99), compared with TT/CT genotype after adjustment for covariates. A similar association of rs2269349 with rectal cancer was observed (OR=0.49; 95%CI=0.24-1.00). Further analyses indicated that this SNP could modify the protective effect of tea drinking on CRC. Among the subjects with rs2269349 TT/CT or rs2133579 AA/GA, there was a marginal significantly lower risk of CRC (OR and 95%CI: 0.63 and 0.39-1.01 for rs2269349; 0.64 and 0.40-1.02 for rs2133579) in tea-drinking subjects in comparison to non-tea-drinking subjects. Mutants in the RPSA gene might be associated with genetic susceptibility to CRC and influence the protective effect of tea consumption in the Chinese population."
24446299,24446299,Association between a single nucleotide polymorphism of the XRCC1 gene and hepatocellular carcinoma susceptibility in the Chinese Han population.,"The human X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 1 (XRCC1) gene is a potentially gene determining hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) susceptibility. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between XRCC1 and susceptibility to HCC. The association of XRCC1 polymorphisms with HCC susceptibility was investigated in 460 HCC patients and 463 controls using the created restriction site-polymerase chain reaction method. Our results indicate that the c.1471G>A variant could be detected and that the allele and genotype frequencies were statistically different between cases and controls. The AA genotype was strongly associated with increased HCC susceptibility as compared with the GG wild genotype (OR = 2.214, 95%CI = 1.493-3.283, χ(2) = 15.97, P < 0.0001). In addition, significantly increased HCC susceptibility was also found in a dominant and recessive model (P < 0.01). The allele A could contribute to HCC susceptibility compared with the G allele (OR = 1.480, 95%CI = 1.224-1.789, χ(2) = 16.44, P = 0.0001). Results from this study indicate that the XRCC1 c.1471G>A polymorphism is associated with HCC susceptibility in the Chinese Han population. Future studies on larger populations are essential to confirm this association."
24458077,24458077,Association of systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility genes with IgA nephropathy in a Chinese cohort.,One hypothesis states that IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a syndrome with an autoimmune component. Recent studies strongly support the notion of shared genetics between immune-related diseases. This study investigated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported to be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a Chinese cohort of patients with IgAN and in controls.
24463019,24463019,Genetic variations in insulin-like growth factor binding protein acid labile subunit gene associated with growth traits in beef cattle (Bos taurus) in China.,"The insulin-like growth factor binding protein acid labile subunit (IGFALS) gene encodes a serum protein that binds to IGFs and regulates growth, development, and other physiological processes. We have found that sequencing of the IGFALS gene in Chinese Qinchuan beef cattle (n=300) revealed four SNP loci in exon two of the gene (g1219: T>C, g1893: T>C, g2612: G>A, and g2696: A>G). The SNP g2696: A>G resulted in a change from asparagine to aspartic acid (p. N574D) in the leucine-rich repeat region in the carboxyl-terminal domain of IGFALS. Four SNPs were in low linkage disequilibrium, and 12 different haplotypes were identified in the population. Association analysis suggested that SNP g1219: T>C had a significant association with hip width (P<0.05) and SNP g2696: A>G displayed a significant association with stature (P<0.05). The results from our investigation indicated that polymorphisms in the IGFALS gene were associated with growth traits of bovine, and may serve as a genetic marker for selection of beef cattle for growth traits, including stature."
24442994,24442994,Association of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) gene polymorphisms with the susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis: a case-control study.,To investigate the association between receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) gene polymorphisms and the susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in a Chinese Han population.
24446301,24446301,A single nucleotide polymorphism of the TNRC9 gene associated with breast cancer risk in Chinese Han women.,"A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the TNRC9 gene was identified as a breast cancer susceptibility genetic variant in recent genome-wide association studies of women of European ancestry. We investigated whether TNRC9 polymorphisms are associated with risk of breast cancer in Chinese women of the Han nationality. We genotyped the SNPs rs3803662, rs1362548, rs1123428 in 870 women, including 388 breast cancer patients and 482 healthy controls, via the PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism procedure and by sequence detection. We found that the T allele and the TT genotype of the SNP rs38033662 is significantly associated with risk for breast cancer in Chinese Han women; however, no significant association was found for rs1362548 or rs1123428. We conclude that SNP rs3803662 is a putative risk factor for breast cancer in Chinese Han women."
24415654,24415654,The involvement of ADAMTS-5 genetic polymorphisms in predisposition and diffusion tensor imaging alterations of lumbar disc degeneration.,"Low back pain is a global health problem in which more than 40% is caused by lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration (LDD). ADAMTS-5 (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-5) was shown to be involved in LDD by functional analyses. To identify whether there is an association between ADAMTS-5 and LDD, and what is the contribution of ADAMTS-5 genetic polymorphisms to MD (Mean diffusivity) changes in lumbar IVD (Intervertebral disc). We firstly genotyped selected ADAMTS-5 SNPs (Single nucleotide polymorphisms) in a Chinese Han population. After the primary analyses of allelic, genotypic, and haplotypic association, we performed SNP-SNP interaction analysis. We subsequently genotyped another 50 participants and acquired the corresponding MD values from individual lumbar IVDs. The association analysis between the genotypic groups divided by the above positive SNPs and the corresponding MD values were also performed. Significant associations were identified in rs151058, rs229052, and rs162502. None of the 2-SNP haplotypic analysis survived the 10,000 permutation test. The following interaction analysis demonstrated that rs151058 was strong associated with LDD when conditioning on rs162502. Significant difference of MD values between AA and G+ carriers was identified in rs162502. This is the first study indicating that the SNPs of ADAMTS-5 may contribute to predisposition of LDD. An interaction between rs151058 and rs229052 may exist in ADAMTS-5 with LDD. The rs162502 might be associated with altered MD values."
24456789,24456789,Variants in the 5'-upstream region of GPC5 confer risk of lung cancer in never smokers.,"A recent genome-wide study (GWAS) has identified GPC5 as a promising susceptibility gene for Lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS). However, the most significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in this GWAS, rs2352028, has yielded controversial results. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between rs2352028 and LCINS. Considering that rs2352028 might be largely marker-SNP correlated to causative variants, two predicted functional SNPs, rs3759452 and rs7322083, were additionally investigated in this study."
24442417,24442417,Genome-wide copy number variation study and gene expression analysis identify ABI3BP as a susceptibility gene for Kashin-Beck disease.,"Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) is a chronic osteochondropathy. In this study, we conducted the first genome-wide copy number variation study (GCNVS) of KBD totally involving 2,743 Chinese Han adults. GCNVS was first performed using Affymetrix Human SNP6.0 Arrays. The identified copy number variations (CNVs) were then replicated in an independent Chinese Han sample containing 1,026 subjects. SNP genotyping, CNV identification and quality control were implemented by Birdsuite. STRUCTURE and EIGENSTRAT were applied for controlling potential population stratification in the GCNVS. Association analysis was conducted using PLINK. Microarray and qRT-PCR were also conducted to compare the expression levels of the genes overlapping with identified CNVs between KBD patients and healthy controls. GCNVS found that CNV452 (P value = 7.78 × 10(-5)) overlapping with ABI3BP gene was significantly associated with KBD. Replication association study observed that rs9850273 (P value = 0.008) and rs7613610 (P value = 0.021) in ABI3BP gene were significantly associated with KBD. Gene expression analysis also found that ABI3BP was up-regulated in KBD patients compared to healthy controls. Our results suggest that ABI3BP was a novel susceptibility gene for KBD."

24414038,24414038,Association of four insulin resistance genes with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension in the Chinese Han population.,"Insulin resistance plays an important role in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association between four insulin resistance genes (ADIPOQ, LEPR, RETN, and TRIB3) and both T2DM and hypertension. A total of 768 Han Chinese subjects were recruited into this study, including 188 cases who had T2DM alone, 223 cases who had hypertension alone, 181 cases with both T2DM and hypertension, and 176 control subjects with neither T2DM nor hypertension. Twenty-three tag SNPs in four insulin resistance genes were genotyped and analyzed for association with T2DM and hypertension. One intron SNP (rs13306519) in LEPR and one 3'UTR SNP (rs1063537) in ADIPOQ demonstrated a significant association with T2DM (P = 0.024 and 0.014 respectively). Another intron SNP (rs12037879) in LEPR and a promoter region SNP (rs266729) in ADIPOQ were significantly associated with hypertension (P = 0.041 and 0.042, respectively). These associations survived the permutation test (P = 0.023, 0.018, 0.026, and 0.035, respectively). These associations were still found to be significant in the additive model after adjusting for potential confounding factors including age, sex, BMI, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels (P = 0.024, 0.016, 0.04, and 0.043, respectively). No other gene variants were found to be significantly associated with T2DM or hypertension (P > 0.05). None of the studied gene variants were found to be significantly associated with T2DM+ hypertension (P > 0.05). A significant interaction was observed between two SNPs rs13306519 in LEPR and rs266729 in ADIPOQ for T2DM (P_int = 0.012, OR_int = 2.67) and hypertension (P_int = 0.0041, OR_int = 2.23). These findings suggest that variants in ADIPOQ and LEPR are risk factors for T2DM and hypertension in the Chinese population and that variants in RETN and TRIB3 are not major risk factors for these diseases."

24398551,24398551,"A commonly carried genetic variant, rs9616915, in SHANK3 gene is associated with a reduced risk of autism spectrum disorder: replication in a Chinese population.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of neurodevelopmental disorders with highly heritability. Recently, abnormality at the synapse is found to be important etiology of ASD. SHANK3 gene is suggested as a strong candidate gene for the pathogenesis of ASD, because it is essential for normally synaptic structure and function. We performed a case-control study to identify association between rs9616915 of the SHANK3 gene and ASD in a Chinese population. Genomic DNA was extracted from oral swabs samples of 212 patients and 636 controls and the SNP genotypes were determined by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymerase assay. Significant difference in genotype distribution of rs9616915 was observed between cases and controls by Pearson's χ(2) test (χ(2) = 6.92, P = 0.031). Genetic analysis of heterozygous model, dominant model and additive model showed an association of the C allele of the rs9616915 with ASD (e.g., additive model, OR 0.582, 95% CI 0.359-0.942, P = 0.028). In conclusion, our results suggested that this commonly genetic variant in SHANK3 gene strikingly decreased the risk of ASD in China."
24447446,24447446,Postmortem genetic screening of SNPs in RyR2 gene in sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome in the southern Chinese Han population.,"To investigate the genetic variants of the RyR2 gene in sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome (SUNDS) in the southern Chinese Han population, we genetically screened 29 of the 105 coding exons of the RyR2 gene associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) in sporadic SUNDS victims using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing methods. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples of 127 SUNDS cases and 165 healthy unrelated controls. None of the published or novel RyR2 missense mutations were found in 127 SUNDS cases. A total of sixteen genetic variants of the RyR2 gene were identified, comprised of: one novel synonymous coding mutation (c.13710C>A), one novel synonymous rare polymorphism (c.14871C>T), and fourteen previously reported polymorphisms. The genotype and allele frequency of previously reported missense polymorphism c.5656G>A (G1886S) was of no statistical difference between SUNDS cases and controls (x(2)=0.390, P>0.05; x(2)=0.271, P>0.05). This is the first report of genetic phenotype of RyR2 gene of SUNDS in the southern Chinese Han population. Previously reported plausible pathogenic missense polymorphism G1886S may not be an independent predisposition factor of SUNDS in the southern Chinese Han population. The association of genetic variants of the RyR2 gene with SUNDS needs further elucidation."

24434811,24434811,The association of interleukin-21 polymorphisms with interleukin-21 serum levels and risk of systemic lupus erythematosus.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is one of the common autoimmune diseases, with complex genetic components. Interleukin-21 (IL-21) is the most recently discovered member of the type-I cytokine family, which has a variety of effects on the immune system, including B cell activation, plasma cell differentiation, and immunoglobulin production. Previous studies have identified that IL-21 was associated with different autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and SLE. Variations in the DNA sequence in the IL-21 gene may lead to altered IL-21 production and/or activity, and thus this can modulate an individual's susceptibility to SLE. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the association of the IL-21 polymorphisms and its serum levels with the risk of SLE in a Chinese population. We analyzed three single nucleotide polymorphisms of IL-21 gene rs907715 C/T, rs2221903 T/C and rs2055979 C/A in 175 patients with SLE and 190 age- and sex-matched controls, using Snapshot SNP genotyping assays and DNA sequencing method. Soluble IL-21 (sIL-21) levels were measured by ELISA. There were significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of IL-21 gene rs2055979 C/A polymorphism between the group of patients with SLE and the control group (P<0.05). sIL-21 levels were increased in patients with SLE compared with controls (P<0.01). Moreover, genotypes carrying the IL-21 rs2055979 A variant allele were associated with increased IL-21 levels compared to the homozygous wild-type genotype in patients with SLE. The rs2055979 C/A polymorphism of IL-21 and its sIL-21 levels were associated with SLE in the Chinese population. Our data suggests that IL-21 gene may play a role in the development of SLE."
24391015,24391015,Polymorphism in PGLYRP-2 gene by PCR-RFLP and its association with somatic cell score and percentage of fat in Chinese Holstein.,"Peptidoglycan recognition protein 2 (PGLYRP-2), which belongs to the PGRP family, is the only member that has no direct bactericidal activity but has N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase activity. This feature of PGLYRP-2 indicates that it may play an important role in eliminating the pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP), such as peptidoglycan (PGN), which can reduce leukocytes in blood and lower somatic cell count (SCC) in milk. To investigate whether the PGLYRP-2 gene is associated with mastitis and milk production traits in dairy cattle, the polymorphism of this gene was analyzed by PCR-RFLP in a population of 546 Chinese Holstein cows. A total of five single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci were identified. The association analysis of a single SNP locus showed that the C+4867T locus was significantly associated (P < 0.05) with somatic cell score (SCS). Surprisingly, all loci were significantly associated (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) with percentage of fat. Association analysis between combined genotypes and SCS and milk production traits indicated that H2H2 was associated with higher percentage of fat (P < 0.05). These findings demonstrated that SNPs in PGLYRP-2 gene were related to mastitis resistance and percentage of fat, and that H2H2 would be a useful genetic marker of combined genotypes for breeding of Chinese Holstein."

However, no such association was observed in other independent genome-wide association studies or replication studies in a European cohort or 2 small sample sizes of Chinese patients. We performed a large case-control study in a cohort consisting of 963 SALS cases and 1039 control subjects to examine the association between the 2 reported SNPs in FGGY and amyotrophic lateral sclerosisin Chinese patients. Our results did not find the SNP rs6690993 in FGGY is associated with Chinese SALS and cannot confirm that this FGGY SNP modulates the risk for SALS in the Chinese population."
24389398,24389398,ITIH family genes confer risk to schizophrenia and major depressive disorder in the Han Chinese population.,"As a major extracellular matrix component, ITIHs played an important role in inflammation and carcinogenesis. Several genome-wide association studies have reported that some positive signals which were derived from the tight linkage disequilibrium region on chromosome 3p21 were associated with both schizophrenia and bipolar disorders in the Caucasian population. To further investigate whether this genomic region is also a susceptibility locus of schizophrenia and major depressive disorder in the Han Chinese population, we conducted this study by recruiting 1235 schizophrenia patients, 1045 major depressive disorder patients and 1235 healthy control subjects in the Han Chinese samples for a case-control study. We genotyped seven SNPs within this region using TaqMan® technology. We found that rs2710322 was significantly associated with schizophrenia (adjusted P(allele) = 0.0018, adjusted P(genotype) = 0.006, OR [95% CI] = 1.278 [1.117-1.462]) while rs1042779 was weakly associated with schizophrenia (adjusted P(allele) = 0.048, OR [95% CI] = 1.164 [1.040-1.303]) and major depressive disorder (adjusted P(allele) = 0.042, OR [95% CI] = 1.178 [1.047-1.326]); it was also our finding that rs3821831 was positively associated with major depressive disorder (adjusted P(allele) = 0.003, adjusted P(genotype) = 0.006, OR [95% CI] = 1.426 [1.156-1.760]). Furthermore, no haplotype was found to be associated with schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. Via the association analysis which combines the schizophrenia and major depressive disorder cases, we also notice that rs1042779 and rs3821831 were significantly associated with combined cases (rs1042779: adjusted P(allele) = 0.012, adjusted P(genotype) = 0.018, OR [95% CI] = 1.171 [1.060-1.292]; rs3821831:adjusted P(genotype) = 0.012, OR [95% CI] = 1.193 [1.010-1.410]). Our results revealed that the shared genetic risk factors of both schizophrenia and major depressive disorder exist in ITIH family genes in the Han Chinese population."
24386238,24386238,A post-GWAS replication study confirming the PTK2 gene associated with milk production traits in Chinese Holstein.,"Our initial genome-wide association study (GWAS) demonstrated that two SNPs (ARS-BFGL-NGS-33248, UA-IFASA-9288) within the protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PTK2) gene were significantly associated with milk production traits in Chinese Holstein dairy cattle. To further validate if the statistical evidence provided in GWAS were true-positive findings, a replication study was performed herein through genotype-phenotype associations. The two tested SNPs were found to show significant associations with milk production traits, which confirmed the associations observed in the original study. Specifically, SNPs lying in the PTK2 gene were also detected by sequencing 14 unrelated sires in Chinese Holsteins and a total of thirty-three novel SNPs were identified. Thirteen out of these identified SNPs were genotyped and tested for association with milk production traits in an independent resource population. After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, twelve SNPs were statistically significant for more than two milk production traits. Analyses of pairwise D' measures of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between all SNPs were also explored. Two haplotype blocks were inferred and the association study at haplotype level revealed similar effects on milk production traits. In addition, the RNA expression analyses revealed that a non-synonymous coding SNP (g.4061098T>G) was involved in the regulation of gene expression. Thus the findings presented here provide strong evidence for associations of PTK2 variants with dairy production traits and may be applied in Chinese Holstein breeding program."
24386393,24386393,Genetic heterogeneity of susceptibility gene in different ethnic populations: refining association study of PTPN22 for Graves' disease in a Chinese Han population.,"In our previous studies, we presumed subtypes of Graves' disease (GD) may be caused by different major susceptibility genes or different variants of a single susceptibility gene. However, more evidence is needed to support this hypothesis. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2476601 in PTPN22 is the susceptibility loci of GD in the European population. However, this polymorphism has not been found in Asian populations. Here, we investigate whether PTPN22 is the susceptibility gene for GD in Chinese population and further determine the susceptibility variant of PTPN22 in GD. We conducted an imputation analysis based on the results of our genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 1,536 GD patients and 1,516 control subjects. Imputation revealed that 255 common SNPs on a linkage disequilibrium (LD) block containing PTPN22 were associated with GD (P<0.05). Nine tagSNPs that captured the 255 common variants were selected to be further genotyped in a large cohort including 4,368 GD patients and 4,350 matched controls. There was no significant difference between the nine tagSNPs (P>0.05) in either the genotype distribution or allelic frequencies between patients and controls in the replication study. Although the combined analysis exhibited a weak association signal (P(combined) = 0.003263 for rs3811021), the false positive report probability (FPRP) analysis indicated it was most likely a false positive finding. Our study did not support an association of common SNPs in PTPN22 LD block with GD in Chinese Han population. This suggests that GD in different ethnic population is probably caused by distinct susceptibility genes."
24392813,24392813,Association of BSG genetic polymorphisms with atherosclerotic cerebral infarction in the Han Chinese population.,"The Basigin (BSG, also known as CD147/extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer) belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). It is a cellular receptor for cyclophilin A (CypA), and is originally known as tumor cell collagenase stimulatory factor (TCSF), which could abundantly expressed on the surface of tumor cells, haematopoietic, monocytes, epithelial endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. Accumulating evidence showed that BSG played an important role in stimulating the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which has been reported to be involved in the development of atherosclerosis. Since atherosclerosis is an important risk factor for atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (ACI), we speculate that BSG genetic polymorphisms may influence formation of atherosclerosis and then development of ACI. This study aimed to detect the potential association of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP, -631 G > T, -318 G > C, 10141 G > A and 10826 G > A) of BSG gene in Hunan Han Chinese population with ACI. We genotyped 199 ACI patients and 188 matched healthy controls for the four BSG SNP by method of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-offlight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Our results suggested that all the polymorphisms were observed in the subjects from Changsha area of Hunan Province. However, no significant difference was observed between the distribution of these SNP in cases and controls. Therefore, we speculate that BSG genetic polymorphisms might not be an important factor in the development of ACI in our Chinese Han population."

24389496,24389496,Interleukin (IL)-21 promoter polymorphism increases the risk of thyroid cancer in Chinese population.,"Polymorphisms in Interleukin (IL)-21 have been researched in several cancers, but the association between IL-21 polymorphisms and thyroid cancer remains unclarified. This case-control study explored the role of five tagSNPs (rs12508721C>T, rs907715G>A, rs13143866G>A, rs2221903A>G and rs4833837A>G) in IL-21 gene in thyroid cancer development. IL-21 genotypes were examined in 615 thyroid cancer patients and 600 controls in Chinese population, and the associations with the risk of thyroid cancer were estimated by logistic regression. Moreover, the potential role of rs12508721C>T in thyroid cancer was further explored by biochemical assays. Compared with the rs12508721CC genotype, CT genotype presented a significantly decreased risk of thyroid cancer (adjusted odds ratios [OR]=0.72; 95%CI=0.57-0.94), the TT carriers had a further decreased risk of thyroid cancer (OR=0.56; 95%CI=0.41-0.87). Furthermore, our quantitative real-time PCR and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results demonstrated that the presence of rs12508721T allele led to more IL-21 expression. However, no significant difference was found in genotype frequencies for other four sites between cases and controls. These findings suggested that rs12508721 polymorphism in IL-21 might be a genetic modifier for the development of thyroid cancer."

Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pre/pri-miRNAs may change their property through altering miRNAs expression and/or maturation. Here we aimed to investigate the influence of three common SNPs in pre/pri-miRNAs (pri-miR-26a-1 rs7372209, pre-miR-27a rs895819 and pri-miR-100 rs1834306) on individual susceptibility to cervical cancer."

24382701,24382701,"Comprehensive analyses of DNA repair pathways, smoking and bladder cancer risk in Los Angeles and Shanghai.","Tobacco smoking is a bladder cancer risk factor and a source of carcinogens that induce DNA damage to urothelial cells. Using data and samples from 988 cases and 1,004 controls enrolled in the Los Angeles County Bladder Cancer Study and the Shanghai Bladder Cancer Study, we investigated associations between bladder cancer risk and 632 tagSNPs that comprehensively capture genetic variation in 28 DNA repair genes from four DNA repair pathways: base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination repair (HHR). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each tagSNP were corrected for multiple testing for all SNPs within each gene using pACT and for genes within each pathway and across pathways with Bonferroni. Gene and pathway summary estimates were obtained using ARTP. We observed an association between bladder cancer and POLB rs7832529 (BER) (pACT = 0.003; ppathway = 0.021) among all, and SNPs in XPC (NER) and OGG1 (BER) among Chinese men and women, respectively. The NER pathway showed an overall association with risk among Chinese males (ARTP NER p = 0.034). The XRCC6 SNP rs2284082 (NHEJ), also in LD with SREBF2, showed an interaction with smoking (smoking status interaction pgene = 0.001, ppathway = 0.008, poverall = 0.034). Our findings support a role in bladder carcinogenesis for regions that map close to or within BER (POLB, OGG1) and NER genes (XPC). A SNP that tags both the XRCC6 and SREBF2 genes strongly modifies the association between bladder cancer risk and smoking."
24374662,24374662,Association of miR-502-binding site single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region of SET8 and TP53 codon 72 polymorphism with non-small cell lung cancer in Chinese population.,"The objective of this study was to identify whether the miR-502-binding site single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of set domain-containing protein 8 (SET8) and the tumor protein p53 (TP53) codon 72 polymorphism were associated with the risk for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), either independently or jointly, among Chinese people from southern Han. The genotypes of SET8 and TP53 codon 72 polymorphisms of peripheral blood DNA were detected using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and direct DNA sequencing in a case-control study on 164 NSCLC cases and 199 controls. The SET8 TT (odds ratio, OR = 2.173, 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.0454.517) or TP53 GG (OR = 2.579, 95% CI = 1.366-4.870) genotype was associated with an increased risk of NSCLC by comparing with the SET8 CC or TP53 CC genotype, respectively. Similar results were obtained in SET8 recessive model (OR = 2.074, 95% CI = 1.019-4.221, P < 0.05), and the dominant and recessive model of TP53 codon 72 were performed, respectively (OR = 1.809, 95% CI = 1.159-2.825, P < 0.05; OR = 1.933, 95% CI = 1.096-3.409, P < 0.05). In addition, interaction between the SET8 and TP53 polymorphisms increased the risk of NSCLC in a multiply manner, with the OR being 3.032 (95%CI = 1.580-5.816) for subjects carrying both SET8 TT and TP53 GG genotypes. Therefore, the miR-502-binding site SNP in the 3'-UTR of SET8 and the TP53 codon 72 polymorphism may be markers of genetic susceptibility to NSCLC in Chinese population, and there is a possible gene-gene interaction in the incidence of NSCLC."
24352695,24352695,Prognostic value of IL-27 polymorphisms and the susceptibility to epithelial ovarian cancer in a Chinese population.,"This study investigated the association between IL-27 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to epithelial ovarian cancer in a Chinese population and discusses the risk factors associated with survival time. We collected data on 229 patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer, from 15 to 77 years of age with a long clinical follow-up period. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was performed to determine the genotype of IL-27 gene polymorphisms. Ovarian cancer-specific survival (OCSS) according to genotype of IL-27 gene polymorphisms was explored by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modeling. Significant differences for genotype frequencies of both SNP sites were found between cases and controls. Both allele G frequencies were significantly greater among the cases (rs153109: 0.404 vs. 0.303, P = 0.001, odds ratio [OR] = 1.333, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.133-1.567; rs17855750: 0.146 vs. 0.083, P = 0.001, OR = 1.766, 95% CI = 1.258-2.481). Haplotype analysis showed haplotypes AG, GT and GG were associated with increased ovarian cancer susceptibility while AT was a protective haplotype. Advanced FIGO stage (stages III + IV) and non-optimal cytoreductive surgery (residual tumor ≥1 cm) were poor prognostic factors in the univariate analysis (P = 0.003, P = 0.049). However, FIGO stage was found to be the only independent significant prognostic factor by Cox proportional hazards analysis (P = 0.042). IL-27p28 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in ovarian cancer patients (P < 0.0001), while no significant relationship was found between IL-27p28 mRNA expression and polymorphism of rs153109 and rs17855750 (P = 0.193 and P = 0.146, respectively). Our study suggests that IL-27 gene polymorphisms may be involved in the susceptibility to epithelial ovarian cancer, but not in survival in a clinic-based Chinese population. Haplotype analysis of these two SNPs seems to be an important mark to predict the disease susceptibility. Advanced FIGO stage, as the only significant, independent risk factor, predicts poor clinical outcomes for patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer. The decreased expression of IL-27p28 mRNA in ovarian cancer might indicate the antitumor activities of this novel cytokine."

24377545,24377545,Association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in miRNA196a-2 and miRNA146a and susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma in a Chinese population.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent cancers in the world and deeply threatens people's health, especially in China. Techniques of early diagnosis, prevention and prediction are still being discovered, among which the approaches based on single nucleotide polymorphisms in microRNA genes (miRNA SNPs) are newly proposed and show prospective potential. In particular, the association between SNPs in miRNA196a-2 (rs11614913) and miRNA146a (rs2910164) and HCC has been investigated. However, the conclusions made were conflicting, possibly due to insufficient sample size or population stratification. Further confirmations in well-designed large samples are still required. In this study, we verified the association between these two SNPs and the susceptibility to HCC by MassARRAY assay in a 2,000 large Chinese case-control sample. Significant association between rs11614913 and HCC was confirmed. Subjects with the genotype of CT+TT or T allele in rs11614913 were more resistant to HCC (CT+TT: OR (95% CI)=0.73 (0.57-0.92), P=0.01; T allele: OR (95% CI)=0.85 (0.75-0.97), P=0.02) and HBV-related HCC (CT+TT: OR (95% CI)=0.69 (0.53-0.90), P=0.01; T allele: OR (95% CI)=0.82 (0.71-0.95), P=0.01). The affected carriers of CT or TT also tended to have lower levels of serum AFP (P=0.01). This study demonstrated a role of rs11614913 in the etiology of HCC. Further research should focus on the clinical use of this miRNA SNP, so as to facilitate conquering HCC."
24343198,24343198,Fine genetic characterization of elite maize germplasm using high-throughput SNP genotyping.,"To investigate the genetic structure of Chinese maize germplasm, the MaizeSNP50 BeadChip with 56,110 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was used to genotype a collection of 367 inbred lines widely used in maize breeding of China. A total of 41,819 informative SNPs with minor allele number of more than 0.05 were used to estimate the genetic diversity, relatedness, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay. Totally 1,015 SNPs evenly distributed in the genome were selected randomly to evaluate the population structure of these accessions. Results showed that two main groups could be determined i.e., the introduced germplasm and the local germplasm. Further, five subgroups corresponding to different heterotic groups, that is, Reid Yellow Dent (Reid), Lancaster Sure Crop (Lancaster), P group (P), Tang Sipingtou (TSPT), and Tem-tropic I group (Tem-tropic I), were determined. The genetic diversity of within subgroups was highest in the Tem-Tropic I and lowest in the P. Most lines in this panel showed limited relatedness with each other. Comparisons of gene diversity showed that there existed some conservative genetic regions in specific subgroups across the ten chromosomes, i.e., seven in the Lancaster, seven in the Reid, six in the TSPT, five in the P, and two in the Tem-Tropical I. In addition, the results also revealed that there existed fifteen conservative regions transmitted from Huangzaosi, an important foundation parent, to its descendants. These are important for further studies since the outcomes may provide clues to understand why Huangzaosi could become a foundation parent in Chinese maize breeding. For the panel of 367 elite lines, average LD distance was 391 kb and varied among different chromosomes as well as in different genomic regions of one chromosome. This analysis uncovered a high natural genetic diversity in the elite maize inbred set, suggesting that the panel can be used in association study, esp. for temperate regions."

24339768,24339768,Detecting genetic association of common human facial morphological variation using high density 3D image registration.,"Human facial morphology is a combination of many complex traits. Little is known about the genetic basis of common facial morphological variation. Existing association studies have largely used simple landmark-distances as surrogates for the complex morphological phenotypes of the face. However, this can result in decreased statistical power and unclear inference of shape changes. In this study, we applied a new image registration approach that automatically identified the salient landmarks and aligned the sample faces using high density pixel points. Based on this high density registration, three different phenotype data schemes were used to test the association between the common facial morphological variation and 10 candidate SNPs, and their performances were compared. The first scheme used traditional landmark-distances; the second relied on the geometric analysis of 15 landmarks and the third used geometric analysis of a dense registration of ∼30,000 3D points. We found that the two geometric approaches were highly consistent in their detection of morphological changes. The geometric method using dense registration further demonstrated superiority in the fine inference of shape changes and 3D face modeling. Several candidate SNPs showed potential associations with different facial features. In particular, one SNP, a known risk factor of non-syndromic cleft lips/palates, rs642961 in the IRF6 gene, was validated to strongly predict normal lip shape variation in female Han Chinese. This study further demonstrated that dense face registration may substantially improve the detection and characterization of genetic association in common facial variation."
24349201,24349201,NEXN is a novel susceptibility gene for coronary artery disease in Han Chinese.,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death and disability in the world. Genome-wide association studies have implicated the importance of the genetic contribution of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) function in CAD susceptibility. The aberrant phenotypic modulation of VSMC is responsible for the pathological vascular intima hyperplasia that is the hallmark for atherosclerotic morphology. NEXN is a muscle-specific F-actin binding protein and is regulated by inflammatory cytokines in VSMCs. Whether NEXN contributes to human vascular disorders is still unknown. In this study, we genotyped 5 SNPs, tagging all of the 17 common SNPs within 54 kilobases (kb) covering NEXN gene and its flanking region, in 1883 patients with CAD and 1973 healthy individuals from Han Chinese, and identified one SNP, rs1780050, which was strongly associated with CAD trait. The Bonferroni corrected P-value was 7.65×10(-5). The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) was 1.23 (1.12-1.36) with statistical power of 0.994. Functional analysis showed that NEXN promotes VSMC to a contractile phenotype in vitro and inhibits balloon-injury induced neointima formation in vivo. Further eQTL analysis demonstrated that the risk allele T of rs1780050 is associated with decreased expression of NEXN, thus contributing to a higher risk of CAD susceptibility in the population. This is, to our knowledge, the first study to identify NEXN as a novel CAD susceptibility gene with both genetic and functional evidence."

24337855,24337855,Association between CHRNA3 rs1051730 genotype and lung cancer risk in Chinese Han population: a case-control study.,"Recent population-based genome wide association studies have revealed potential susceptibility loci of lung cancer at the region of chromosome 15q25.1 containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptor genes. The loci increasing lung cancer risk has been widely identified in Caucasians, but whether this association also exists in Asians and whether this association is a direct role or mediated via tobacco smoking indirectly has not been fully established. We conducted a case-control study comprising of 210 histologically confirmed lung cancer cases and 200 healthy controls to examine rs1051730 genotyping, a single nucleotide polymorphism receiving much attention recently, and its influence on lung cancer risk as well as nicotine dependence in a Chinese Han population. Our results showed that the heterozygous C/T genotype and minor allele T conferred a significant higher risk of lung cancer than the CC homozygotes and allele C (adjusted OR=2.25, 95% CI=1.04-4.89, P=0.040 and OR=2.18, 95% CI=1.02-4.67, P=0.045 respectively). However, no association between the smoking habit and the CHRNA3 rs1051730 polymorphism was observed in this study. The results suggested that the rs1051730 polymorphism may modify susceptibility to lung cancer via a smoking-independent manner among Chinese Han population. Additional studies in vitro and in vivo are warranted to further elucidate the impact of rs1051730 on lung cancer susceptibility."
24326043,24326043,No association between polymorphisms in the calcium homeostasis modulator 1 gene and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy risk in a Chinese population.,"Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is one of the most common forms of epilepsies in adults. The calcium homeostasis modulator 1 gene (CALHM1) has been considered one of the candidate genes that play a role in epileptogenesis due to its function in calcium homeostasis and amyloid β (Aβ) regulation. Recently, the association of a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs11191692) of CALHM1 has been reported to be associated with MTLE in Han Chinese, but independent replication is needed. In the present study, rs11191692 and rs2986017 of CALHM1 were determined in 512 MTLE patients and 412 control subjects to investigate the possible involvement of CALHM1 in the etiology of MTLE."
24325909,24325909,Genetic variation rs10484761 on 6p21.1 derived from a genome-wide association study is associated with gastric cancer survival in a Chinese population.,"A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) on esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) among Chinese people has discovered a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10484761 on 6p21.1 region. We hypothesized that SNP rs10484761 T/C is associated with survival of gastric cancer. We genotyped SNP rs10484761 in 940 gastric cancer patients treated with surgical resection. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the association between the SNP rs10484761 and gastric cancer survival. In the dominant model, those who carry TC/CC genotypes had a significant shorter survival time (log-rank P=0.005), especially in the subgroups of aged male patients, cardia intestinal tumor (HR=1.41, 95% CI=1.08-1.84 for cardia cancer and HR=1.64, 95% CI=1.14-2.37 for intestinal-type), tumor size ≤ 5 cm (HR=1.41, 95% CI=0.56-0.99), T1 depth invasion (HR=2.34, 95% CI=1.20-4.56), lymph node metastasis (HR=1.51, 95% CI=1.19-1.96), no distant metastasis (HR=1.33, 95% CI=1.05-1.68), TNM stage III+IV (HR=1.50, 95% CI=1.13-1.98), and with chemotherapy (HR=1.53, 95% CI=1.17-1.99). The results indicated that SNP rs10484761 was associated with prognosis of gastric cancer, suggesting that this genetic variant may serve as a potential marker to predict the survival of gastric cancer in Chinese population."
24333172,24333172,Association analysis of a functional variant in ATXN2 with schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe mental disorder characterized by multiple neurodevelopmental dysfunctions including a breakdown of thinking process and a deficit of typical emotional responses. Ataxin-2 (ATXN2) plays vital roles in cell proliferation and growth, and functional mutations of ATXN2 cause neurodegenerative phenotypes, including spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To explore the possible role of ATXN2 in SZ, we conducted a two-stage study to examine the association of ATXN2 polymorphisms with SZ in the Han Chinese population. Association analysis of seven SNPs in 768 patients and 1348 controls revealed two associated SNPs, including rs630511 (P=1.76E-4) and rs7969300 (P=5.08E-4). We examined these two SNPs in a validation sample of 1957 patients and 1509 controls, and observed an association of rs7969300 with SZ (P=5.03E-3). The SNP rs7969300 is a non-synonymous SNP causing a Ser to Asn substitution, which is predicted to increase the protein stability of ATXN2. Our data suggest that the ATXN2 gene may confer vulnerability for SZ, adding further evidence for the genetic variants within the developmental pathway in the illness."
24376627,24376627,How genome-wide SNP-SNP interactions relate to nasopharyngeal carcinoma susceptibility.,"This study is the first to use genome-wide association study (GWAS) data to evaluate the multidimensional genetic architecture underlying nasopharyngeal cancer. Since analysis of data from GWAS confirms a close and consistent association between elevated risk for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and major histocompatibility complex class 1 genes, our goal here was to explore lesser effects of gene-gene interactions. We conducted an exhaustive genome-wide analysis of GWAS data of NPC, revealing two-locus interactions occurring between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and identified a number of suggestive interaction loci which were missed by traditional GWAS analyses. Although none of the interaction pairs we identified passed the genome-wide Bonferroni-adjusted threshold for significance, using independent GWAS data from the same population (Stage 2), we selected 66 SNP pairs in 39 clusters with P<0.01. We identified that in several chromosome regions, multiple suggestive interactions group to form a block-like signal, effectively reducing the rate of false discovery. The strongest cluster of interactions involved the CREB5 gene and a SNP rs1607979 on chromosome 17q22 (P = 9.86×10(-11)) which also show trans-expression quantitative loci (eQTL) association in Chinese population. We then detected a complicated cis-interaction pattern around the NPC-associated HLA-B locus, which is immediately adjacent to copy-number variations implicated in male susceptibility for NPC. While it remains to be seen exactly how and to what degree SNP-SNP interactions such as these affect susceptibility for nasopharyngeal cancer, future research on these questions holds great promise for increasing our understanding of this disease's genetic etiology, and possibly also that of other gene-related cancers."
24325471,24325471,Significance of MDM2-309 polymorphisms and induced corresponding plasma MDM2 levels in susceptibility to laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.,"The tumor suppressor p53 plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability and tumor prevention. Murine double-minute 2 (MDM2) oncoprotein plays a pivotal role in regulating p53, and the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 309T/G SNP in the promoter region of Mdm2 has been shown to be associated with increased risk of cancer. We investigated the association between Mdm2-309 promoter polymorphism, plasma MDM2 levels, and risk of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). In this case-control study, 146 patients with LSCC, 61 patients with vocal leukoplakia, and 212 healthy controls were genotyped for the Mdm2-309 T/G gene using pyrosequencing. Plasma MDM2 levels were also analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients with LSCC had a significantly lower frequency of GT at Mdm2-309 (odds ratio [OR]=0.50, p=0.02) than controls. The proportion of GT heterozygotes in advanced stage cases were less than that in the initial stage patients (OR: 0.36 vs. 0.63; p=0.007 and 0.16). The same result was found between cases with and without lymph node metastases (OR: 0.45 vs. 0.52; p=0.075 and 0.04). Moreover, the plasma Mdm2 concentrations of LSCC patients (343.36±14.8 pg/mL) were significantly higher than those in controls (255.76±8.2 pg/mL; p<0.01) and vocal leukoplakia patients (301.42±8.6 pg/mL; p<0.05). Patients in advanced stages and with lymph node metastasis had higher plasma MDM2 levels, while the GT genotypes (308.06±18.9 pg/mL; p=0.037) had lower MDM2 plasma levels than the TT genotypes (369.00±25.2 pg/mL). The Mdm2 SNP309 G allele is implicated as an important LSCC and a vocal leukoplakia protective factor in the Chinese Han Population, and the proportion of GT genotype was lower in advanced LSCC patients and lymph node metastasis patients. Moreover, Mdm2-309 GT genotype patients had a lower plasma MDM2 level than the TT genotypes."

24315816,24315816,Effect of interleukin-17A and interleukin-17F gene polymorphisms on the risk of gastric cancer in a Chinese population.,"We selected six tagged single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-17A and IL-17F genes, and evaluated the relationship between the six common SNPs and H. pylori infection, tobacco smoking and subsites of gastric cancer in gastric cancer patients. Genotyping of IL-17A (rs2275913, rs3748067 and rs3819025) and IL-17A (rs763780, rs9382084, and rs12203582) was performed in a 384-well plate format on the MassARRAY® platform. An unconditional multiple logistical regression model was performed to determine the association between IL-17A and IL-17F genetic variations and gastric cancer risk. Unconditional logistic regression analysis showed that subjects carrying the rs2275913AA and rs3748067 TT genotypes were 1.70 and 3.45 times more likely to develop gastric cancer. Furthermore, rs2275913 and rs3748067 genetic variants significantly interacted with H. pylori infection on the risk of gastric cancer. The interaction between rs3748067 and rs9382084 genetic variants and tobacco smoking trend was significant. In addition, rs2275913, rs3748067 and rs9382084 genetic variants were only associated with non-cardia gastric cancer. The findings suggest that the rs2275913, rs3748067 and rs9382084 polymorphisms increase the risk of gastric cancer, and they interact with H. pylori infection, tobacco smoking and subsites of gastric cancer. These findings could be helpful in identifying individuals at increased risk for developing gastric cancer."

We aimed to investigate the association of XRCC3 genetic polymorphism with HCC risk. This study was conducted in a Chinese Han population consisting of 300 HCC cases and 300 sex- and age-matched cancer-free controls. Three genetic variants (rs861539, rs12432907, and rs861537) were genotyped by the TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assay. Our findings suggested that the TT genotype and T allele from rs861539 genetic variants were statistically associated with HCC risk. The TT genotype was statistically associated with the increased risk of HCC compared to CC wild genotype (P < 0.001). And the T allele was more common in the HCC patients than that in the control subjects. (OR = 1.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.457 ~ 2.659, P < 0.001). Haplotype-based case-control study analysis indicated that TTG haplotype was more frequent in HCC groups than in the control group (odds ratio (OR) = 1.967, 95% CI 1.456 ~ 2.658); however, the CTG haplotype is more common in the control group than that in the HCC group (OR = 0.550, 95 % CI 0.430 ~ 0.703; P < 0.001).

Samples from 172 hepatocellular carcinoma patients and 185 cancer-free controls were collected from October 2008 to December 2011. PCR-RFLP analysis was performed to determine the polymorphisms in each individual. The MAFs of miR-146aG>C and miR-499A>G in controls were similar to that known from the SNP database, and frequencies of genotypes in controls were in line with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We found that miR-499 AG was significantly associated with decreased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma when compared with miR-499 AA genotype (adjusted odds ration = 0.74, 95% confidence interval = 0.24-0.96). However, subjects carrying miR-146a GG had a non-significant 0.62-fold decreased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. We did not find a significant association of miR-146aG>C rs2910164 and miR-499A>G rs3746444 polymorphisms with hepatocellular carcinoma risk in the Chinese population. Further investigations are warranted to clarify the relationship between miRNA polymorphisms and susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma risk in various ethnic populations."
24304228,24304228,Polymorphisms of EpCAM gene and prognosis for non-small-cell lung cancer in Han Chinese.,"The epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is overexpressed in a wide variety of human cancers and is associated with patient prognosis, including those with lung cancer. However, the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the EpCAM gene with the prognosis for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients has never been investigated. We evaluated the association between two SNPs, rs1126497 and rs1421, in the EpCAM gene and clinical outcomes in a Chinese cohort of 506 NSCLC patients. The SNPs were genotyped using the Sequenom iPLEX genotyping system. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to assess the association of EpCAM gene genotypes with the prognosis of NSCLC. We found that the non-synonymous SNP rs1126497 was significantly associated with survival. Compared with the CC genotype, the CT+TT genotype was a risk factor for both death (hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.94; P = 0.040) and recurrence (hazard ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.02-1.77; P = 0.039). However, the SNP rs1421 did not show any significant effect on patient prognosis. Instead, the AG+GG genotype in rs1421 was significantly associated with early T stages (T1/T2) when compared with the AA genotype (odds ratio for late stage = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44-0.96, P = 0.029). Further stratified analysis showed notable modulating effects of clinical characteristics on the associations between variant genotypes of rs1126497 and NSCLC outcomes. In conclusion, our study indicated that the non-synonymous SNP rs1126497 may be a potential prognostic marker for NSCLC patients."

24309291,24309291,Association between the SORL1 rs2070045 polymorphism and late-onset Alzheimer's disease: interaction with the ApoE genotype in the Chinese Han population.,"Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) is a common neurodegenerative disease [1], and the two well identified pathological hallmarks of LOAD are senile plaques formed from amyloid β peptides (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) consisting of hyperphorylated tau protein [2]. The neuronal Sortilin-related receptor (SORL1) is involved in the processing and trafficking of amyloid precursor protein (APP) into recycling pathways, thus influencing Aβ generation and by this AD pathology [3]. To explore the relationship between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the SORL1 SNP 19 rs2070045 and LOAD, a case-control study was conducted in a Chinese Han cohort including 77 LOAD patients and 100 control participants. This SNP 19 rs2070045 was genotyped with a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, (PCR-RFLP) method. The association was revealed between the polymorphism of SNP 19 rs2070045 (T/T, T/G, G/G) and the risk of LOAD. The results of this study indicated that the T allele (T/G+T/T) of SNP 19 rs2070045 was successful in exerting obvious influence in LOAD patients (χ(2)=4.884, P=0.027<0.05). However, there is no sufficient evidence to prove that the T allele of SNP 19 rs2070045 is associated with ɛ4 allele of ApoE gene in LOAD patients (χ(2)=0.771, P=0.380>0.05)."
24299183,24299183,"Expression, SNP identification, linkage disequilibrium, and haplotype association analysis of the growth suppressor gene ZBED6 in Qinchuan beef cattle.","Zinc finger, BED-type containing 6 (ZBED6) is a novel transcription factor that was identified and shown to act as a repressor of IGF2 transcription in skeletal muscle myogenesis and development. The aims of this study were to determine ZBED6 expression level and examine the association of the ZBED6 polymorphism with growth traits in Qinchuan beef cattle. The bovine ZBED6 mRNA was detected in eight tissues by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), being highly expressed in skeletal muscle. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified the bovine ZBED6 by sequencing pooled DNA samples (Pool-Seq) and forced polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (forced PCR-RFLP) methods. In this study, we reported one mutation in the promoter and two missense mutations in the coding regions within the bovine ZBED6 gene, and the haplotype variability and extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in 817 individuals from the Qinchuan (QC) and Chinese Holstein (CH). We also investigated haplotype structure and linkage disequilibrium coefficients for three SNPs of ZBED6 in the study populations. The result of haplotype analysis of three SNPs showed that eight different haplotypes were identified in two breeds. The wild-type haplotype (Hap 1: GCA) and mutant-type haplotype (Hap 8: AGG) shared by two populations accounted for 29.8%, 57.5%, and 8.6%, 0% of all haplotypes observed in QC and CH, respectively. The statistical analyses indicated that three SNPs, 23 combined genotypes, and 8 haplotypes were significantly associated with different growth traits in the QC cattle population (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The mutant-type variants and mutant haplotype were superior for growth traits; the heterozygote diplotype was associated with higher growth traits compared to the wild-type homozygote. The results of this study suggest that the ZBED6 gene possibly is a strong candidate gene that affects growth traits in QC beef cattle breeding program."

24292686,24292686,No evidence for a genetic association of IRF4 with systemic lupus erythematosus in a Chinese population.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease with immunological defects caused by abnormal immune regulation and excessive production of autoantibodies. Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) as a lymphocyte-restricted member of the IRF family is expressed exclusively in immune system cells and is essential for the development of T helper-2 (Th2) cells, IL17-producing T helper (Th17) cells, and IL9-producing T helper (Th9) cells. Some studies have shown that IRF4 is important in the development of autoimmune diseases. The role of IRF4 in human SLE has not been extensively studied. This article will discuss the relationship between the IRF4 gene polymorphism (single nucleotide polymorphism rs872071) and the susceptibility to SLE in a Chinese Han population. A case-control study was performed with 663 SLE patients and 658 healthy controls. The results showed that IRF4 gene polymorphism (rs872071) was not significantly different between SLE patients and healthy controls [A/G vs. G/G: p = 0.543, odds ratio (OR) = 0.872, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.562-1.355; G vs. A: p = 0.512, OR = 1.058, 95 % CI 0.893-1.254; A/A + A/G vs. G/G: p = 0.475, OR = 0.857, 95 % CI 0.562-1.308]. Similarly, in a subgroup analysis of clinical manifestation of lupus nephritis (LN), no significant differences were found between the non-LN group and the LN group (G/G vs. A/G vs. A/A: χ(2) = 0.611, p = 0.631; G vs. A: χ(2) = 0.411, p = 0.521).These findings suggest that the IRF4 gene polymorphism is not associated with SLE in a Chinese Han population; further studies are needed to establish the role of IRF4 in SLE with a larger sample size."

24291029,24291029,Association analysis of ERBB2 amplicon genetic polymorphisms and STARD3 expression with risk of gastric cancer in the Chinese population.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether risk of gastric cancer (GC) was associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a gene cluster on the chromosome 17q12-q21 (ERBB2 amplicon) in the Chinese Han population. We detected twenty-six SNPs in this gene cluster containing steroidogenic acute regulatory-related lipid transfer domain containing 3 (STARD3), protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 1B (PPP1R1B/DARPP32), titin-cap (TCAP), per1-like domain containing 1(PERLD1/CAB2), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (ERBB2/HER2), zinc-finger protein subfamily 1A 3 (ZNFN1A3/IKZF3) and DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha (TOP2A) genes in 311 patients with GC and in 425 controls by Sequenom. We found no associations between genetic variations and GC risk. However, haplotype analysis implied that the haplotype CCCT of STARD3 (rs9972882, rs881844, rs11869286 and rs1877031) conferred a protective effect on the susceptibility to GC (P=0.043, odds ratio [OR]=0.805, 95% confidence intervals [95% CI]=0.643-0.992). The STARD3 rs1877031 TC genotype endued histogenesis of gastric mucinous adenocarcinoma and signet-ring cell carcinoma (P=0.021, OR=2.882, 95% CI=1.173-7.084). We examined the expression of STARD3 in 243 tumor tissues out of the 311 GC patients and 20 adjacent normal gastric tissues using immumohistochemical (IHC) analysis and tissue microarrays (TMA). The expression of STARD3 was observed in the gastric parietal cells and in gastric tumor tissues and significantly correlated with gender (P=0.004), alcohol drinking (P<0.001), tumor location (P=0.007), histological type (P=0.005) and differentiation (P=0.023) in GC. We concluded that the combined effect of haplotype CCCT of STARD3 might affect GC susceptibility. STARD3 expression might be related to the tumorigenesis of GC in the Chinese population."

We aimed to replicate this finding in Caucasians. Using the TaqMan approach we typed rs3827440 in 560 GD patients from Warsaw and 196 patients from Gliwice as well as ethically matched controls (N = 748, N = 198, respectively). We found an association of the rs3827440 T allele with GD using both an allelic and genotype comparison [odds ratio (OR) = 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.38, P = 0.021; OR=1.32, 95% CI: 1.03-1.69, P = 0.03, respectively]. There was no difference in distribution of rs3827440 alleles/genotypes vs gender, tobacco smoking, ophthalmopathy or age at disease onset. Also, no statistically significant differences were observed after stratifying patients for DRB1*03- or GD-associated variants in CTLA4 or TSHR genes. Our study provides the first replication in a Caucasian population of the association between GD and rs3827440 originally reported among Chinese.

Multiple variants associated with hypertension have been identified in the large numbers of genome-wide association studies, meta-analysis, and case-control studies. The present study investigated the association between the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of five candidate genes and the susceptibility and prognosis of hypertension in a Chinese Han population. A hospital-based case-control study in a Chinese Han population was carried out, including 500 hypertension patients and 506 healthy controls. The five SNP markers were detected using the Sequenom MassArray(®) iPLEX System. The association of genotypes with susceptibility to hypertension was analyzed using odds ratio, with 95% confidence interval and logistic regression. All five variants conformed to Hardy-Weinberg proportions in the controls. No significant differences were noted in the genotype distributions for AGTR1, PRRC2A, and CALCA polymorphisms in patients with hypertension (N = 500) and healthy controls (N = 506). SNP rs2932538, a variant in MOV10, was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of hypertension. However, SNP rs4373814, a variant in CACNB2, showed a relevant association with a decreased risk of hypertension. In conclusion, the results of our case-control study confirmed the significant association of the SNP rs2932538 in MOV10 and SNP rs4373814 in CACNB2 with an increased risk of hypertension in a Chinese Han population, suggesting that the SNP rs2932538 may be a poor prognostic indicator for hypertension, while SNP rs4373814 may be a good prognostic indicator for hypertension in the same region. However, our findings need to be replicated in larger epidemiological and functional studies."
24269996,24269996,"Genetic polymorphisms of the IFNλ genes are associated with biochemical features in Han Chinese with HCV infection from Yunnan Province, China.","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the pathogenic factor for hepatitis C disease, which could lead to chronic or serious hepatic diseases. Previous studies have identified that the IL28B gene polymorphisms were associated with therapeutic effect and viral clearness of HCV patients. We aimed to test whether genetic polymorphisms of three IFNλ genes (IL28A, IL28B and IL29) are associated with HCV infection in Han Chinese. We collected whole blood of 261 HCV infectious patients without any therapy and 265 matched normal controls from Yunnan Province. Among these subjects, 28.4% (74/261) of HCV patients and 26.8% (71/265) of controls were male. Ten SNPs (rs8099917, rs10853728, rs11883177, rs12980602, rs4803224, rs11671087, rs11665818, rs8108008, rs7248931, and rs30461), which covered the whole region of the IL28A, IL28B, and IL29 genes, were genotyped. Our results showed that there was no association between genotypes and alleles of the IFNλ gene polymorphisms and HCV infection. One haplotype (TGCTGTGGAT), which was consisted of ten SNPs, showed a significantly higher frequency in HCV patients (11/522 = 2.1%) than in controls (1/530 = 0.2%) (P = 0.003). We performed association analyses for biochemical features and genotype of each SNP, and found that HCV patients with certain genotypes of some SNPs had a higher level of the ALT/AST ratio and total blood bilirubin (TBIL) compared to healthy controls. Our results suggested the IFNλ gene polymorphisms might be associated with clinical features of HCV patients from Yunnan Province, China."

In this study, we examined 33 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in two genes by performing an association analysis in a cohort of 1430 schizophrenia patients and 1570 healthy Han Chinese control subjects. Single SNP association, sex-specific association and haplotype association analyses were performed. For the rs1625579 marker in MIR137 and the rs1006737 and rs4765905 markers in CACNA1C, significant differences in the allele frequencies were found between the patients and controls (p=0.007949, p=0.013658 and p=0.013999, respectively), and the genotype association analysis for them suggested a similar pattern (p=0.023167, p=0.046623 and p=0.047824, respectively). Further analysis of the haplotype rs1006737-rs4765905-rs882194 in CACNA1C showed significant associations with schizophrenia (corrected global p<0.005), and two haplotypes (ACC and ACT) in the block were significantly increased in the patients. When the samples were analyzed separately by gender, we found no significant sex-specific associations in MIR137 and CACNA1C, which was similar to the results from the relevant haplotype association analysis in the female and male subgroups.

However, 5-10% of healthy adults fail to produce protective levels of antibody against the hepatitis B vaccination. It has been reported that host genetic variants might affect the immune response to hepatitis B vaccination. Here, we reported a genome-wide association study in a Chinese Han population consisting of 108 primary high-responders and 77 booster non-responders to hepatitis B vaccination using the Illumina HumanOmniExpress Beadchip. We identified 21 SNPs at 6p21.32 were significantly associated with non-response to booster hepatitis B vaccination (P-value <1 × 10(-6)). The most significant SNP in the region was rs477515, located ∼12 kb upstream of the HLA-DRB1 gene. Its P-value (4.81 × 10(-8)) exceeded the Bonferroni-corrected genome-wide significance threshold. Four tagging SNPs (rs477515, rs28366298, rs3763316 and rs13204672) that capture genetic information of these 21 SNPs were validated in three additional Chinese Han populations, consisting of 1336 primary high-responders and 420 primary non-responders. The four SNPs continued to show significant associations with non-response to hepatitis B vaccination (P-combined = 3.98 × 10(-13)- 1.42 × 10(-8)). Further analysis showed that the rs477515 was independently associated with non-response to hepatitis B vaccination with correction for other three SNPs in our GWAS and the known hepatitis B vaccine immunity associated SNP in previous GWAS. Our findings suggest that the rs477515 was an independent marker associated with non-response to hepatitis B vaccination and HLA-DR region might be a critical susceptibility locus of hepatitis B vaccine-induced immunity."

24269186,24269186,An obesity genetic risk score is associated with metabolic syndrome in Chinese children.,"Recent genome-wide association studies have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with body mass index (BMI)/obesity. In this study, we aim to examine the associations of obesity related loci with risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in a children population from China. A total of 431 children with MetS and 3046 controls were identified based on the modified ATPIII definition. 11 SNPs (FTO rs9939609, MC4R rs17782313, GNPDA2 rs10938397, BDNF rs6265, FAIM2 rs7138803, NPC1 rs1805081, SEC16B rs10913469, SH2B1 rs4788102, PCSK1rs6235, KCTD15 rs29941, BAT2 rs2844479) were genotyped by TaqMan 7900. Of 11 SNPs, GNPDA2 rs10938397, BDNF rs6265, and FAIM2 rs7138803 were nominally associated with risk of MetS (GNPDA2 rs10938397: odds ratio (OR)=1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.04-1.40, P=0.016; BDNF rs6265: OR=1.19, 95% CI=1.03-1.39, P=0.021; FAIM2 rs7138803: OR=1.20, 95% CI=1.02-1.40, P=0.025); genetic risk score (GRS) was significantly associated with risk of MetS (OR=1.09, 95% CI=1.04-1.15, P=5.26×10(-4)). After further adjustment for BMI, none of SNPs were associated with risk of MetS (all P>0.05); the association between GRS and risk of MetS remained nominally (OR=1.02, 95%CI=0.96-1.08, P=0.557). However, after correction for multiple testing, only GRS was statistically associated with risk of MetS in the model without adjustment for BMI. The present study demonstrated that there were nominal associations of GNPDA2 rs10938397, BDNF rs6265, and FAIM2 rs7138803 with risk of MetS. The SNPs in combination have a significant effect on risk of MetS among Chinese children. These associations above were mediated by adiposity."

24232574,24232574,The brachyury Gly177Asp SNP is not associated with a risk of skull base chordoma in the Chinese population.,"A recent chordoma cancer genotyping study reveals that the rs2305089, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in brachyury gene and a key gene in the development of notochord, is significantly associated with chordoma risk. The brachyury gene is believed to be one of the key genes involved in the pathogenesis of chordoma, a rare primary bone tumor originating along the spinal column or at the base of the skull. The association between the brachyury Gly177Asp single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and the risk of skull base chordoma in Chinese populations is currently unknown. We investigated the genotype distribution of this SNP in 65 skull-base chordoma cases and 120 healthy subjects. Comparisons of the genotype distributions and allele frequencies did not reveal any significant difference between the groups. Our data suggest that the brachyury Gly177Asp SNP is not involved in the risks of skull-base chordoma, at least in the Chinese population."
24242875,24242875,Interleukin-7 receptor single nucleotide polymorphism rs6897932 (C/T) and the susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus.,"Emerging evidences were accumulated to support the view that aberrant interleukin-7 (IL-7) signaling might be associated with autoimmunity. Former studies demonstrated the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6897932 C/T in the IL-7 receptor (IL-7R) gene was associated with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and type I diabetes. Given these, this study was conducted to investigate whether an association existed between SNP rs6897932 and the susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a severe systemic autoimmune disease. In this context, 816 SLE patients and 816 controls from a Chinese population were recruited for this study, and the results showed that the major allele C of rs6897932 showed a higher frequency in SLE patients compared with controls (P = 0.039, C versus T); significant difference was also detected under a recessive model with regard to the distribution of genotype frequencies between SLE patients and controls (P = 0.041, CC versus CT + TT), which was not consistent with the results under a dominant model (P = 0.349, CC + CT versus TT). Moreover, association studies were also performed contraposing the relationship between the SNP rs6897932 C/T and lupus nephritis as well as 10 clinical features of SLE; however, no significant association signal was found regarding the distribution of allele and genotype frequencies between SLE patients positive and negative for the presence of 11 sub-phenotypes. In conclusion, the major allele C of SNP rs6897932 may be associated with increased SLE risk in Chinese populations, and further studies are still encouraged to shed light on the true associations between SLE and its susceptibility genes with respect to IL-7R gene."
24195510,24195510,A polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 alpha confers an increased risk of cervical cancer in a Chinese population.,"Cervical cancer is a multifactorial disease involving a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. An important role of HIF-1α in cervical cancer carcinogenesis has been studied by multiple researches. We hypothesized that there is a possible association between HIF-1α gene polymorphisms and the risk of cervical cancer in Chinese women. In a case-control study of 518 cervical cancer patients and 553 cancer-free controls, we genotyped three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs11549465, rs11549467 and rs2057482) of HIF-1α using the TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays and assessed its associations with the cervical cancer risk. Besides, 17 cervical cancer tissues were used to assess the expression of the mature mRNA expression of HIF-1α by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR. We found that a significantly increased risk of cervical cancer was associated with the CC genotype of rs2057482 in the 3´-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of HIF-1α (odds ratio (OR), 1.44; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11-1.88), compared with the CT/TT genotypes. Moreover, the carriers of CT/TT genotypes had significantly decreased HIF-1α mRNA expression levels compared to those with CC genotype. No association was observed between the two polymorphisms (rs11549465, rs11549467) and cervical cancer risk. So that, our results provided the first insight into rs2057482 polymorphism of in the 3´-untranslated region of HIF-1α contributed to the risk of cervical cancer in a Chinese population and thus may serve as a reliable predictive factor of cervical cancer."
24223962,24223962,Insight into the peopling of Mainland Southeast Asia from Thai population genetic structure.,"There is considerable ethno-linguistic and genetic variation among human populations in Asia, although tracing the origins of this diversity is complicated by migration events. Thailand is at the center of Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA), a region within Asia that has not been extensively studied. Genetic substructure may exist in the Thai population, since waves of migration from southern China throughout its recent history may have contributed to substantial gene flow. Autosomal SNP data were collated for 438,503 markers from 992 Thai individuals. Using the available self-reported regional origin, four Thai subpopulations genetically distinct from each other and from other Asian populations were resolved by Neighbor-Joining analysis using a 41,569 marker subset. Using an independent Principal Components-based unsupervised clustering approach, four major MSEA subpopulations were resolved in which regional bias was apparent. A major ancestry component was common to these MSEA subpopulations and distinguishes them from other Asian subpopulations. On the other hand, these MSEA subpopulations were admixed with other ancestries, in particular one shared with Chinese. Subpopulation clustering using only Thai individuals and the complete marker set resolved four subpopulations, which are distributed differently across Thailand. A Sino-Thai subpopulation was concentrated in the Central region of Thailand, although this constituted a minority in an otherwise diverse region. Among the most highly differentiated markers which distinguish the Thai subpopulations, several map to regions known to affect phenotypic traits such as skin pigmentation and susceptibility to common diseases. The subpopulation patterns elucidated have important implications for evolutionary and medical genetics. The subpopulation structure within Thailand may reflect the contributions of different migrants throughout the history of MSEA. The information will also be important for genetic association studies to account for population-structure confounding effects."
24206655,24206655,Association of a polymorphism in PON-1 gene with steroid-induced osteonecrosis of femoral head in Chinese Han population.,"Treatment with steroids covers a wide spectrum of diseases in clinic. However, some users are suffering from serious side effects of steroid administration, while we enjoy the benefit it brings about. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a troublesome one among them. Recent studies have demonstrated that lipid metabolism disorder may play a vital role in pathogenesis of ONFH and mutation of the paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) gene may be involved in the occurrence of this disease. However, the relationship between polymorphisms of PON-1 and ONFH has not been thoroughly studied. The aim of this study was to determine whether PON-1 polymorphisms are associated with steroid-induced ONFH through a cohort study among Chinese Han population."

However, some following replication studies yielded inconsistent results."
24188974,24188974,Differences in asthma genetics between Chinese and other populations.,"Asthma is caused by complex gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Most asthma genes are not replicable across populations, which is possibly because of differences in the epidemiology of these genes. Our case-control association and next-generation sequencing studies revealed substantial discrepancies in the frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotype blocks for asthma genes between Chinese and other populations. The minor allele frequencies for nearly half of our studied SNPs differed by 0.2 or greater between southern Chinese subjects in Hong Kong and European white populations, African populations, or both. Because genome-wide association studies for asthma have not been performed in Chinese subjects, we cannot tell whether the genomic findings of recent consortium-based genome-wide association studies are applicable to our population. In addition, our group performed Roche 454 pyrosequencing on a 100-kb area spanning each of 10 asthma loci in 24 healthy Hong Kong children. For the 17q21 locus, there was substantial variation in the haplotype structures that were constructed from 224 common SNPs among Hong Kong subjects and 6 ethnic groups under the 1000 Genomes Project. Sixteen mostly small haplotype blocks were formed in Hong Kong, whereas 6 haplotype blocks were identified in Han Chinese in Beijing and central European subjects and 11 and 19 blocks were identified in Puerto Rican and Yoruba African subjects. In conclusion, differences in allele frequencies of asthma genes and haplotype structures of asthma loci are found between Chinese subjects and other ethnic groups. These sequence variations must be considered during the selection of tagging SNPs for replicating genetic associations between populations."
24177231,24177231,The RTK/ERK pathway is associated with prostate cancer risk on the SNP level: a pooled analysis of 41 sets of data from case-control studies.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a malignant disease influencing numerous men worldwide every year. However, the exact pathogenesis and the genes, environment, and other factors involved have not been explained clearly. Some studies have proposed that cell signaling pathways might play a key role in the development and progression of PCa. According to our previous study, the RTK/ERK pathway containing nearly 40 genes was associated with PCa risk. On the basis of these genes, we conducted a meta-analysis with our own Chinese Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ChinaPCa) study and available studies in the databases to describe the association between the pathway and PCa on the SNP level. The results suggested that rs4764695/IGF1 (recessive model: pooled OR=0.92, 95%CI=0.852-0.994, P=0.034; I(2)=0%, P=0.042; allele analysis: pooled OR=0.915, 95%CI=0.874-0.958, P=0; I(2)=0%, P=0.424; codominant model: OR=0.835, 95%CI=0.762-0.916, P=0; I(2)=0%, P=0.684) and rs1570360/VEGF (recessive model: OR=0.596, 95%CI=0.421-0.843, P=0.003; I(2)=23.9%, P=0.269; codominant model: OR=0.576, 95%CI=0.404-0.820, P=0.002; I(2)=49.1%, P=0.140) were significantly associated with PCa. In subgroup analysis, the relationship was also found in Caucasians for IGF1 (dominant model: OR=0.834, 95%CI=0.769-0.904, P=0; allele analysis: OR=0.908, 95%CI=0.863-0.955, P=0; AA vs CC: OR=0.829, 95%CI=0.750-0.916, P=0; AC vs CC: OR=0.837, 95%CI=0.768-0.912, P=0). In addition, in Asians (allele analysis: OR=0.21, 95%CI=0.168-0.262, P=0) and Caucasians (recessive model: OR=0.453, 95%CI: 0.240-0.855, P=0.015; codominant model: OR=0.464, 95%CI=0.240-0.898, P=0.023) for VEGF, the association was significant. The results indicated that rs4764695/IGF1 and rs1570360/VEGF might play a key role in the development and progression of PCa. On the SNP level, we suggest that the study gives us a new view of gene-pathway analysis and targeted therapy for PCa."

Two polymorphisms of the FSHR gene were identified, which caused a change of threonine (T) to alanine (A) at position 307 and asparagine (N) to serine(S) at position 680. Both polymorphic sites give rise to three discrete variants of the FSHR: TT, TA, and AA for position 307; NN, NS, and SS for position 680."
24152165,24152165,Replication of results of genome-wide association studies on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma susceptibility loci in a Korean population.,"Two recent genome-wide association studies have identified that the rs2274223 single-nucleotide polymorphism inphospholipase C epsilon 1 and the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs13042395 in C20orf54 are involved in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in Chinese populations. We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms of phospholipase C epsilon 1 and C20orf54 are also associated with ESCC in a Korean population. The rs2274223 and rs13042395 genotyping was performed using high-resolution melting analysis. The rs2274223 GG genotype was significantly associated with an increased risk of ESCC (odds ratio [OR]=1.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.08-3.25) compared with the rs2274223 AA genotype. The rs13042395 G allele showed a significantly decreased risk of ESCC in the younger age group (OR=0.71, 95% CI=0.52-0.97) and no significant association in the older group (OR=1.19, 95% CI=0.87-1.62). We observed that the rs2274223 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of ESCC in this Korean case-control study and that age may modify the association between the rs13042395 polymorphism and the risk of ESCC."

Moreover, the TMEM106B risk variant is also implicated in the pathologic presentation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we evaluated the association between TMEM106B rs1990622 polymorphism and late-onset AD (LOAD) in a Northern Han Chinese population consists of 1,133 LOAD patients and 1,159 controls. Our data demonstrate that TMEM106B and APOE interact to increase AD risk."

24223174,24223174,A genetic polymorphism in pre-miR-27a confers clinical outcome of non-small cell lung cancer in a Chinese population.,Recent evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) can function as tumor suppressors and oncogenes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at miRNA genes can influence the maturation of miRNAs or miRNA-mediated transcriptional regulation. Our objective was to investigate the association of SNPs in deregulated miRNAs with clinical outcome in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a Chinese population.
24148305,24148305,The potential role of CAMSAP1L1 in symptomatic epilepsy.,"In a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of symptomatic epilepsy in the Chinese population, the most significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) allele was rs2292096 [G] (P=1.0×10(-8), odds ratio [OR]=0.63), in the CAMSAP1L1 gene (also known as CAMSAP2). Here, we report that rs2292096 genotypes tended to associate with expression of CAMSAP1L1 RNA in the temporal lobe (p=0.054) and hippocampus (p=0.20) of epilepsy surgery patients, with expression tending to increase with the G allele. CAMSAP1L1 and β-tubulin double immunofluorescence exhibited partial overlap. CAMSAP1L1 siRNA transfection of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells treated with or without retinoic acid reduced the CAMSAP1L1 protein level nearly 60% and stimulated neurite outgrowth, as measured by total length, number of processes and number of branches. Therefore, the rs2292096 G allele of CAMSAP1L1, which was associated with reduced risk of symptomatic epilepsy, tended to associate with increased expression of CAMSAP1L1, which represses neurite outgrowth. Greater neurite growth in response to brain insults might increase formation of ectopic neural circuits and thus the risk of epileptogenesis."

24190014,24190014,BRG1 variant rs1122608 on chromosome 19p13.2 confers protection against stroke and regulates expression of pre-mRNA-splicing factor SFRS3.,"A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1122608 on chromosome 19p13.2 and in the BRG1/SMARCA4 gene was previously associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD and ischemic stroke are both associated with atherosclerosis. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that rs1122608 is associated with ischemic stroke. Further studies were used to identify the most likely mechanism by which rs1122608 regulates atherosclerosis. For case-control association studies, two independent Chinese Han GeneID cohorts were used, including a Central cohort with 1,075 cases and 2,685 controls and the Northern cohort with 1,208 cases and 824 controls. eQTL and real-time RT-PCR analyses were used to identify the potential candidate gene(s) affected by rs1122608. The minor allele T of SNP rs1122608 showed significant association with a decreased risk of ischemic stroke in the Central GeneID cohort (adjusted P adj = 2.1 × 10(-4), OR 0.61). The association was replicated in an independent Northern GeneID cohort (P adj = 6.00 × 10(-3), OR 0.69). The association became more significant in the combined population (P adj = 7.86 × 10(-5), OR 0.73). Allele T of SNP rs1122608 also showed significant association with a decreased total cholesterol level (P adj = 0.013). Allele T of rs1122608 was associated with an increased expression level of SFRS3 encoding an mRNA splicing regulator, but not with the expression of BRG1/SMARCA4 or LDLR (located 36 kb from rs1122608). Increased expression of SFSR3 may decrease IL-1β expression and secretion, resulting in reduced risk of atherosclerosis and stroke. This is the first study that demonstrates that rs1122608 confers protection against ischemic stroke and implicates splicing factor SFSR3 in the disease process."
24146964,24146964,Association of GRM7 variants with different phenotype patterns of age-related hearing impairment in an elderly male Han Chinese population.,"Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the Glutamate metabotrophic receptor 7 gene (GRM7) have recently been identified by the genome-wide association study (GWAS) as potentially playing a role in susceptibility to age-related hearing impairment (ARHI), however this has not been validated in the Han Chinese population. The aim of this study was to determine if these SNPs are also associated with ARHI in an elderly male Han Chinese population. In this case-control candidate genes association study, a total of 982 men with ARHI and 324 normal-hearing controls subjects were studied. Using K-means cluster analysis, four audiogram shape subtypes of ARHI were identified in the case group: ''flat shape (FL)'', ''sloping shape (SL)'', ''2-4 kHz abrupt loss (AL) shape'' and ''8 kHz dip (8D) shape''. Results suggested that the SNP rs11928865 (A>T) of GRM7 was significantly associated with ARHI after adjusting for non-genetic factors (p = 0.000472, OR = 1.599, 95%CI = 1.229~2.081). Furthermore, frequency of TT genotype (rs11928865) were significant higher in the SL subgroup and AL subgroup with compared to controls group (p = 9.41E-05, OR = 1.945, 95%CI = 1.393~2.715; p = 0.000109, OR = 1.915, 95%CI = 1.378~2.661 adjusted, respectively) after Bonferroni correction. However, there wasn't significant difference in the frequency of the TT genotype between cases in the FL subgroup or the 8D subgroup with when compared with controls. Results of the current study suggest that, in an elderly male Han Chinese population, GRM7 SNP rs11928865 (TT) occurs more frequently in ARHI patients with SL and AL phenotype patterns."
24136745,24136745,Association between microRNA genetic variants and susceptibility to colorectal cancer in Chinese population.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the pathogenesis of neoplasm. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within miRNAs can change their phenotype and function. We attempted to analyze the relationship between two SNP loci in miRNAs and colorectal cancer (CRC) in Chinese Han population. We genotyped the polymorphism of two common miRNA SNPs, miR-146a (rs2910164 G > C) and miR-499 (rs3746444 T > C), in a case-control study of 276 CRC cases and 373 healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The genotypes and allele frequencies of the two SNP loci were first compared between patients and controls and then further analyzed among subgroups of patients with different clinicopathological profiles. The rs2910164 CG genotype was significantly associated with a decreased risk of CRC [CG versus GG, odds ratio (OR) = 0.567; 95% confidence intervals (CIs) = 0.338-0.952; p = 0.031]. No significant differences of miR-499 genotype and allele distribution were detected between patients and controls. Comparison between groups divided by clinicopathologic features showed that the polymorphism of miR-146a was associated with the degree of tumor differentiation (p = 0.014), and the G allele of rs2910164 trended to a mature differentiation (OR = 0.553; 95% CI = 0.315-0.971; p = 0.038). MiR-146a (rs2910164 G > C) polymorphism is associated with CRC susceptibility and histological differentiation in Chinese Han population."

Recently, the rs2075650 single nucleotide polymorphism in the translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog (TOMM40) gene was identified as a risk factor for AMD and Alzheimer disease. We aimed to examine the associations between the TOMM40 rs2075650 polymorphism and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) in a Chinese population."
24125424,24125424,Meta-analysis identifies robust association between SNP rs17465637 in MIA3 on chromosome 1q41 and coronary artery disease.,"Several large-scale meta-GWAS identified significant association between SNP rs17465637 in the MIA3 gene and coronary artery disease (CAD) in the European ancestry populations. However, three follow-up replication studies in the Chinese populations yielded inconsistent results. In order to unequivocally determine whether SNP rs17465637 is associated with CAD, we performed an independent case control association study in the Chinese Han population and a follow-up large scale meta-analysis for SNP rs17465637. Our study included 2503 CAD patients and 2920 non-CAD controls of the Chinese Han origin. A significant association was found between SNP rs17465637 and CAD (P = 0.01, OR = 1.11). Meta-analysis included 7263 CAD patients and 8347 controls combined from five Asian populations. The association between SNP rs17465637 and CAD became highly significant (P = 4.97 × 10(-5), OR = 1.11). Similar analysis also identified significant association between SNP rs17465637 and MI (2424 cases vs. 6,536controls; P = 5.00 × 10(-3), OR = 1.10). We conclude that SNP rs17465637 in MIA3 is indeed a genetic risk factor for CAD across different ethnic populations."

Causal role of resistin, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and genetic variants have not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify quantitative trait loci associated with resistin levels and investigated whether these variants were prospectively associated with the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and T2DM in an independent community-based cohort, the CardioVascular Disease risk FACtors Two-township Study (CVDFACTS)."

24098741,24098741,Weighted SNP set analysis in genome-wide association study.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are popular for identifying genetic variants which are associated with disease risk. Many approaches have been proposed to test multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a region simultaneously which considering disadvantages of methods in single locus association analysis. Kernel machine based SNP set analysis is more powerful than single locus analysis, which borrows information from SNPs correlated with causal or tag SNPs. Four types of kernel machine functions and principal component based approach (PCA) were also compared. However, given the loss of power caused by low minor allele frequencies (MAF), we conducted an extension work on PCA and used a new method called weighted PCA (wPCA). Comparative analysis was performed for weighted principal component analysis (wPCA), logistic kernel machine based test (LKM) and principal component analysis (PCA) based on SNP set in the case of different minor allele frequencies (MAF) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) structures. We also applied the three methods to analyze two SNP sets extracted from a real GWAS dataset of non-small cell lung cancer in Han Chinese population. Simulation results show that when the MAF of the causal SNP is low, weighted principal component and weighted IBS are more powerful than PCA and other kernel machine functions at different LD structures and different numbers of causal SNPs. Application of the three methods to a real GWAS dataset indicates that wPCA and wIBS have better performance than the linear kernel, IBS kernel and PCA."

24094242,24094242,Genome-wide association study on serum alkaline phosphatase levels in a Chinese population.,"Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a complex phenotype influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Recent Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified several loci affecting ALP levels; however, such studies in Chinese populations are limited. We performed a GWAS analyzing the association between 658,288 autosomal SNPs and serum ALP in 1,461 subjects, and replicated the top SNPs in an additional 8,830 healthy Chinese Han individuals. The interactions between significant locus and environmental factors on serum ALP levels were further investigated."
24083421,24083421,SNPs in KIT and KITLG genes may be associated with oligospermia in Chinese population.,"KIT/KITLG signaling system is crucial for spermatogenesis, which suggests that KIT and KITLG genes may be involved in spermatogenesis impairment and male infertility. To explore the possible association of KIT and KITLG genes with male infertility having spermatogenesis impairment, polymorphism distributions of SNP rs3819392 in KIT gene as well as rs995030 and rs4474514 in KITLG gene were investigated in 372 patients with idiopathic azoospermia or oligospermia and 205 fertile controls. As a result, the significant differences in polymorphism distributions of SNP rs3819392 in KIT gene and rs4474514 in KITLG gene were observed between the patients with oligospermia and controls. The frequencies of allele G (94.2% versus 90.0% p = 0.022) and genotype GG (89.2% versus 82.0% p = 0.042) in patients with oligospermia were significantly higher than those in controls at rs3819392 locus in KIT gene. In addition, the genotype CC of rs4474514 in KITLG (8.2% versus 3.4%, p = 0.034) also significantly increased in oligospermic patients in comparison to controls. These findings indicated that SNP rs3819392 in KIT gene and rs4474514 in KITLG gene may be associated with oligospermia, suggesting that polymorphism of KIT and KITLG genes may play a role in oligospermia."
24075188,24075188,The IL-33-ST2L pathway is associated with coronary artery disease in a Chinese Han population.,"The effects of interleukin-33 (IL-33) on the immune system have been clearly demonstrated; however, in cardiovascular diseases, especially in coronary artery disease (CAD), these effects have not yet been clarified. In this study, we investigate the genetic role of the IL-33-ST2L pathway in CAD. We performed three-stage case-control association analyses on a total of 4,521 individuals with CAD and 4,809 controls via tag SNPs in the genes encoding IL-33 and ST2L-IL-1RL1. One tag SNP in each gene was significantly associated with CAD (rs7025417(T) in IL33, padj = 1.19 × 10(-28), OR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.31-1.47; rs11685424(G) in IL1RL1, padj = 6.93 × 10(-30), OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.32-1.48). Combining significant variants in two genes, the risk for CAD increased nearly 5-fold (padj = 8.90 × 10(-21), OR = 4.98, 95% CI: 3.56-6.97). Traditional risk factors for CAD were adjusted for the association studies by SPSS with logistic regression analysis. With the two variants above, both located within the gene promoter regions, reporter gene analysis indicated that the rs7025417 C>T and rs11685424 A>G changes resulted in altered regulation of IL33 and IL1RL1 gene expression, respectively (p < 0.005). Further studies revealed that the rs7025417 genotype was significantly associated with plasma IL-33 levels in the detectable subjects (n = 227, R(2) = 0.276, p = 1.77 × 10(-17)): the level of IL-33 protein increased with the number of rs7025417 risk (T) alleles. Based on genetic evidence in humans, the IL-33-ST2L pathway appears to have a causal role in the development of CAD, highlighting this pathway as a valuable target for the prevention and treatment of CAD."
24066090,24066090,Determining ancestry proportions in complex admixture scenarios in South Africa using a novel proxy ancestry selection method.,"Admixed populations can make an important contribution to the discovery of disease susceptibility genes if the parental populations exhibit substantial variation in susceptibility. Admixture mapping has been used successfully, but is not designed to cope with populations that have more than two or three ancestral populations. The inference of admixture proportions and local ancestry and the imputation of missing genotypes in admixed populations are crucial in both understanding variation in disease and identifying novel disease loci. These inferences make use of reference populations, and accuracy depends on the choice of ancestral populations. Using an insufficient or inaccurate ancestral panel can result in erroneously inferred ancestry and affect the detection power of GWAS and meta-analysis when using imputation. Current algorithms are inadequate for multi-way admixed populations. To address these challenges we developed PROXYANC, an approach to select the best proxy ancestral populations. From the simulation of a multi-way admixed population we demonstrate the capability and accuracy of PROXYANC and illustrate the importance of the choice of ancestry in both estimating admixture proportions and imputing missing genotypes. We applied this approach to a complex, uniquely admixed South African population. Using genome-wide SNP data from over 764 individuals, we accurately estimate the genetic contributions from the best ancestral populations: isiXhosa [Formula: see text], ‡Khomani SAN [Formula: see text], European [Formula: see text], Indian [Formula: see text], and Chinese [Formula: see text]. We also demonstrate that the ancestral allele frequency differences correlate with increased linkage disequilibrium in the South African population, which originates from admixture events rather than population bottlenecks."
24085429,24085429,"Molecular cloning, polymorphisms, and association analysis of the promoter region of the STAM2 gene in Wuchuan Black cattle.","The STAM protein plays an important role in the cytokine-related JAK/STAT pathway. We selected the STAM2 gene as a candidate gene that could be linked to growth performance in analysis of a Chinese cattle breed (Wuchuan Black cattle). We examined genetic variants in the promoter region of the STAM2 gene and their associations with eight growth traits in 159 individuals. Seven SNPs, which included six new SNPs for the SNP database, were found. The core promoter region was identified with a bioinformatic software. This analysis also showed that the SNPs have a significant influence on the function and structure of the STAM2 promoter in terms of RNA secondary structure, CpG island, and transcription factor binding sites. Association analysis demonstrated that G-102A is significantly associated with withers height, heart girth, cannon circumference, chest width, and hip height in this population, which leads us to suggest that G-102A is a useful SNP marker for cattle growth performance. Animals with the genotype AA had higher mean values for withers height, cannon circumference, chest width, and hip height than those with GG and AG genotypes. This SNP of the STAM2 gene could be applied in marker-assisted selection for improving growth performance in cattle."
24066410,24066410,Evaluation of the relationship between the ZNF804A single nucleotide polymorphism rs1344706 A/C variant and schizophrenia subtype in Han Chinese patients.,"Recent genome wide association studies (GWASs) assessing the relationship between schizophrenia (SZ) and the ZNF804A gene, particularly the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1344706, have yielded conflicting results. Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder, so it is possible that an association may be restricted to specific SZ subtypes and that population heterogeneity may obscure a contribution of ZNF804A allelic variation to SZ risk. We thus evaluated the association between rs1344706 and different clinical SZ subtypes in a large Han Chinese patient population."

24065684,24065684,Association between the TRAIL single nucleotide polymorphism rs1131580 and type 2 diabetes mellitus in a Han Chinese population.,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is expressed in different tissues and cells, including the pancreas and lymphocytes, and it can selectively induce apoptosis in tumor cells but not in most normal cells. TRAIL plays critical roles in type 1 diabetes mellitus, and is involved in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We recently discovered the association of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a risk factor for T2DM, with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the TRAIL (TNFSF10) gene at site 1595C/T (rs1131580), indicating the possible association of T2DM with this TRAIL polymorphism. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of the TRAIL SNP at site 1595C/T (rs1131580) with T2DM susceptibility and the biometabolic parameters of T2DM in a Han Chinese population. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method was used to genotype SNP rs1131580 in 292 patients with T2DM and 266 healthy controls. We found that the frequency of the CC genotype and that of the C allele of rs1131580 were significantly higher in T2DM patients than in the control group. Additionally, the triglyceride and serum creatinine levels of T2DM patients with the CC genotype were significantly higher than those of patients with the TT genotype. Thus, the CC genotype of the TRAIL SNP at 1595C/T (rs1131580) confers increased susceptible to T2DM in a Han Chinese population from Shandong Province. These data suggest that the CC genotype at this SNP is related to diabetic severity and it might be a candidate for the prognostic assessment of T2DM."
24069371,24069371,Helicobacter pylori infection synergizes with three inflammation-related genetic variants in the GWASs to increase risk of gastric cancer in a Chinese population.,"Three recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have reported that three SNPs (rs4072037, rs13361707 and rs2274223) located on genes related to host inflammatory response are significantly associated with susceptibility to gastric cancer (GC) in Chinese populations. Helicobacter pylori infection is also an important risk factor for GC through causing inflammatory response in the gastric mucosa. However, no study has established whether there are potential gene-environment interactions between these genetic variants and H. pylori infection to the risk of GC."
24073265,24073265,Common genetic variations in Patched1 (PTCH1) gene and risk of hirschsprung disease in the Han Chinese population.,"Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is the most frequent genetic cause of congenital intestinal obstruction with an incidence of 1:5000 live births. In a pathway-based epistasis analysis of data generated by genome-wide association study on HSCR, specific genotype of Patched 1 (PTCH1) has been linked to an increased risk for HSCR. The aim of the present study is to examine the contribution of genetic variants in PTCH1 to the susceptibility to HSCR in Han Chinese. Accordingly, we assessed 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within PTCH1 gene in 104 subjects with sporadic HSCR and 151 normal controls of Han Chinese origin by the Sequenom MassArray technology (iPLEX GOLD). Two of the eight genetic markers were found to be significantly associated with Hirschsprung disease (rs357565, allele P = 0.005; rs2236405, allele P = 0.002, genotype P = 0.003). Both the C allele of rs357565 and the A allele of rs2236405 served as risk factors for HSCR. During haplotype analysis, one seven-SNP-based haplotype was the most significant, giving a global P = 0.0036. Our results firstly suggest common variations of PTCH1 may be involved in the altered risk for HSCR in the Han Chinese population, providing potential molecular markers for early diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease."
24065649,24065649,Single-nucleotide polymorphism of the pri-miR-34b/c gene is not associated with susceptibility to congenital heart disease in the Han Chinese population.,"Recent evidence has shown that the microRNA polymorphism may play an important role in the susceptibility to congenital heart disease (CHD). A potentially functional SNP rs4938723 (T>C) in the promoter region of pri-miR-34b/c might affect transcription factor GATA binding and therefore pri-miR-34b/c expression. We genotyped the pri-miR-34b/c polymorphism in a case-control study of 590 patients and 672 controls in a Han Chinese population and assessed the effects of the pri-miR-34b/c polymorphism on CHD susceptibility by TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. There was no association between the pri-miR-34b/c polymorphism and the risk of CHD in both genotype and allelic frequency. In a subsequent analysis of the association between this polymorphism and CHD classification, there was still no significant difference in both genotype and allelic frequency. Our results suggest that the pri-miR-34b/c polymorphism rs4938723 is not associated with susceptibility to sporadic CHD in the Han Chinese population."
24083537,24083537,SORL1 genetic variants modulate risk of amnestic mild cognitive impairment in northern Han Chinese.,"The neuronal sortilin-related receptor (SORL1) has been reported to modulate the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a variety of populations, but replication studies have been inconsistent. Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is characterized by episodic memory impairment and represents the prodromal stage of AD. However, the relationship between SORL1 and aMCI remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between SORL1 genetic variation and aMCI in the Han Chinese population. We conducted a case-control study using a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs668387 (SNP8), in the 5' region of SORL1, and three SNPs [rs2070045 (SNP19), rs3824968 (SNP23), rs2282649 (SNP24)] in the 3' region of SORL1, along with a haplotype analysis, in 139 aMCI patients and 213 cognitively-healthy controls from a northern Han Chinese population. We observed that SNP19 had a significantly different allele frequency between aMCI patients and controls (p = 0.006). Moreover, the GAT haplotype at SNPs 19-23-24 was associated with an increased risk of aMCI [odds ratio (OR) 1.377], while the TTC haplotype at SNPs 19-23-24 was associated with a decreased risk (OR 0.708). These results indicated that the SNPs in the 3' region of SORL1 are associated with aMCI in northern Han Chinese."
24065669,24065669,Association between single nucleotide polymorphisms of the osteoprotegerin gene and postmenopausal osteoporosis in Chinese women.,"Osteoporosis is an important and common complex health problem, particularly in postmenopausal women. It is characterized by a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) and a deterioration of bone microarchitecture with a consequent increase of fracture risk. The osteoprotegerin (OPG) gene is considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. We analyzed SNPs of the OPG gene and associations between these polymorphisms and BMD in 399 Chinese postmenopausal women. BMD was quantified at the lumbar spine (L2-4), femoral neck, and total hip. The g.2264T>C and g.27676A>C SNPs were detected by PCR-RFLP and DNA sequencing methods. A significant association with spine BMD was found for g.27676A>C. The spine BMD value for subjects with genotype AA was significantly higher than those with genotypes GA and AA. No significant association was detected between any of the SNP marker genotypes and the other traits. We conclude that g.27676A>C in the OPG gene affects spine BMD and that the C allele is associated with increased risk for osteoporosis in Chinese postmenopausal women."

However, the results have been inconsistent. We therefore here examined whether the rs3759223 polymorphism confers high myopia risk by conducting a meta-analysis."
24050543,24050543,A polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 alpha confers an increased risk of cervical cancer in a Chinese population.,"Cervical cancer is a multifactorial disease involving a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. An important role of HIF-1α in cervical cancer carcinogenesis has been studied by multiple researches. We hypothesized that there is a possible association between HIF-1α gene polymorphisms and the risk of cervical cancer in Chinese women. In a case-control study of 518 cervical cancer patients and 553 cancer-free controls, we genotyped three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs11549465, rs11549467 and rs2057482) of HIF-1α using the TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays and assessed its associations with the cervical cancer risk. Besides, 17 cervical cancer tissues were used to assess the expression of the mature mRNA expression of HIF-1α by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR. We found that a significantly increased risk of cervical cancer was associated with the CC genotype of rs2057482 in the 3´-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of HIF-1α (odds ratio (OR), 1.44; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11-1.88), compared with the CT/TT genotypes. Moreover, the carriers of CT/TT genotypes had significantly decreased HIF-1α mRNA expression levels compared to those with CC genotype. No association was observed between the two polymorphisms (rs11549465, rs11549467) and cervical cancer risk. So that, our results provided the first insight into rs2057482 polymorphism of in the 3´-untranslated region of HIF-1α contributed to the risk of cervical cancer in a Chinese population and thus may serve as a reliable predictive factor of cervical cancer.

24043878,24043878,Common variants on Xq28 conferring risk of schizophrenia in Han Chinese.,"Schizophrenia is a highly heritable, severe psychiatric disorder affecting approximately 1% of the world population. A substantial portion of heritability is still unexplained and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia remains to be elucidated. To identify more schizophrenia susceptibility loci, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 498 patients with schizophrenia and 2025 controls from the Han Chinese population, and a follow-up study on 1027 cases and 1005 controls. In the follow-up study, we included 384 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which were selected from the top hits in our GWAS (130 SNPs) and from previously implicated loci for schizophrenia based on the SZGene database, NHGRI GWAS Catalog, copy number variation studies, GWAS meta-analysis results from the international Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) and candidate genes from plausible biological pathways (254 SNPs). Within the chromosomal region Xq28, SNP rs2269372 in RENBP achieved genome-wide significance with a combined P value of 3.98 × 10(-8) (OR of allele A = 1.31). SNPs with suggestive P values were identified within 2 genes that have been previously implicated in schizophrenia, MECP2 (rs2734647, P combined = 8.78 × 10(-7), OR = 1.28; rs2239464, P combined = 6.71 × 10(-6), OR = 1.26) and ARHGAP4 (rs2269368, P combined = 4.74 × 10(-7), OR = 1.25). In addition, the patient sample in our follow-up study showed a significantly greater burden for pre-defined risk alleles based on the SNPs selected than the controls. This indicates the existence of schizophrenia susceptibility loci among the SNPs we selected. This also further supports multigenic inheritance in schizophrenia. Our findings identified a new schizophrenia susceptibility locus on Xq28, which harbor the genes RENBP, MECP2, and ARHGAP4."
24035934,24035934,FoxP3 genetic variants and risk of non-small cell lung cancer in the Chinese Han population.,"CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cell-mediated immunosuppression is one of the crucial mechanisms that tumor cells use to evade the immune system. The forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) gene regulates regulatory T-cell development and function and may modulate the susceptibility to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Because a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the FoxP3 gene (rs3761548 in the promoter region) is associated with susceptibility to Graves' disease, this study detected rs3761548 in a hospital-based case-control study. A total of 192 NSCLC patients and 259 healthy subjects were recruited for the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis of FoxP3 SNP. The data showed that the A allele of rs3761548 significantly increased NSCLC risk (P=0.000, OR=2.32, 95%CI=1.736-3.102). The AC genotype, AA genotype, and the combined A variant genotype (AA+AC) were also associated with a higher risk of NSCLC (OR [95%CI]=2.147[1.419-3.247], 4.413[2.359-8.255], and 2.563[1.746-3.761], respectively). Moreover, a significantly higher frequency of AA+AC genotype was observed in patients with stage II NSCLC (OR, 2.053; 95%CI, 1.033-4.078). In conclusion, the data from the current study demonstrated for the first time the association of the FoxP3 SNP with a risk of developing NSCLC in the Chinese Han population."
24064681,24064681,Nonsynonymous polymorphisms of the PDLIM5 gene association with the occurrence of both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.,"Two single nucleotide polymorphisms of PDLIM5, rs7690296 and rs11097431, were genotyped using Mass-Array SNP genotyping by Sequenom technology in 244 bipolar disorder patients, 471 schizophrenia patients, and 601 control individuals who were Malay, Chinese, and Indian ethnic groups in the Malaysian population. A significant association was observed in allele frequency between the rs7690296 polymorphism and bipolar disorder in the Indian ethnic group [P=0.02, adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.058, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.93]. A significant association was also observed between the rs7690296 polymorphism and schizophrenia under the recessive model for both Malay (P=0.02, adjusted OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.12-3.10) and Indian (P=0.02, adjusted OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.10-3.37) ethnic groups. However, no association was detected between the rs11097431 polymorphism either with bipolar disorder or with schizophrenia.

24035893,24035893,Lack of association between COMT Val158Met polymorphism and late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Han Chinese.,"COMT (catechol-O-methyltransferase) has been conjectured to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its key role in cognitive function impairment by influencing the dopamine degradation in prefrontal cortex. A functional single nucleotide polymorphism (rs4680 SNP; G to A) in the COMT coding region causes Val158Met amino acid substitution in the corresponding protein, with Val allele exhibiting markedly 3- to 4-fold higher than Met in enzyme activity. Recent study reported that the functional rs4680 polymorphism within COMT gene was associated with susceptibility to AD in Caucasians. In order to examine the association between polymorphism in COMT gene and late-onset AD (LOAD) in a Han Chinese group, we analyzed the genotype and allele distributions of the COMT rs4680 polymorphism in a Han Chinese population consisting of 2291 individuals (1132 LOAD patients and 1159 healthy controls). In the present study, we find no significant association between the COMT rs4680 polymorphism and LOAD, even after statistical adjustment for age, gender and apolipoprotein E (APOE) status in the total sample as well as stratification for APOE status. Our results indicated that the COMT Val158Met polymorphism may not play a major role in the development of LOAD in Han Chinese."

24034601,24034601,Single-nucleotide polymorphisms of IRF8 gene are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus in Chinese Han population.,"Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) has been shown to have diverse roles in the regulation of the immune system. Two recent studies had revealed the association between the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs11644034 and rs2280381) of IRF8 and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a multiethnic population. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the association could be replicated in a Chinese Han population. Genotypes were determined by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction-ligase detection reaction (PCR-LDR) in 358 patients and 357 geographically matched healthy controls. Significant differences in genotype frequency were found between SLE and control individuals (rs11644034: AA vs. GG, P = 0.014, odds ratio (OR) = 0.980, 95% confidence internal (CI): 0.964-0.996; rs2280381: CC vs. TT, P = 0.005, OR = 0.150, 95% CI: 0.033-0.676). Conditional logistic regression analysis showed that the association of rs2280381 remained significant (P adjusted = 0.028) after adjustment for rs11644034, but not vice versa (P adjusted = 0.361).When stratifying patients with SLE according to clinical subtypes, SNP rs2280381 was found to be associated with low complement in patients with SLE. However, SNP rs11644034 was not found to be associated with SLE clinical subgroups. Analysis of the haplotypes revealed that haplotype G-T and G-C were also significantly associated with SLE (P = 0.002 and P = 0.012, respectively). Our study indicated that the IRF8 gene polymorphisms might be associated with susceptibility to SLE and with disease-related clinical manifestations in Chinese Han population."

24018213,24018213,Missense variants in CR1 are associated with increased risk of Alzheimer' disease in Han Chinese.,"Complement receptor 1 (CR1) has been considered to play an important role in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) pathogenesis. To explore the correlation between the CR1 gene and LOAD, a 2-step design study was conducted in our Northern Han Chinese population. We first sequenced the promoter, exons, the 5' and 3' untranslated regions and exon-intron boundaries of CR1 in a small sample (n = 100). This allowed us to identify a total of 22 variants. In addition, 6 missense variants within the CR1 gene were selected to be genotyped in a total of 2292 individuals. Only 2 SNPs (rs116806486, Thr→Ala; rs6691117, Ile→Val) were significantly associated with an increased risk of LOAD. After stratiﬁcation by APOE ε4-carrying status, significance was observed in APOE ε4 non-carriers for rs116806486 and in APOE ε4 carriers for rs6691117. Logistic analysis revealed that the rs116806486 polymorphism remained associated with LOAD in a dominant model, whereas the rs6691117 polymorphism was associated with LOAD in additive and recessive models but not in a dominant model after adjusting for sex, age at onset, and APOE ε4 status. Examination of the haplotypes identified the risk of a 3-SNP (rs2274567, rs3737002, and rs6691117) haplotype ""ATG"" in CR1 was associated with an increased risk for LOAD. These findings provide the evidence that missense variants in the CR1 gene may be involved in LOAD pathologic process in Han Chinese."

It plays a key role in the lipid biosynthesis as well as in the general metabolism of all living animals. We herein investigated polymorphisms of FASN. As a result, six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found and then genotyped in 752 Chinese Holstein cows. It was found that g.17924A>G was non-synonymous, g.13965 C>T, g.16907 T>C and g.18663T>C were synonymous mutations and two other two SNPs, g.8948 C>T (ss491228481) and g.14439T>C (rs133498277), were in intronic sequences of the gene. All such identified SNPs were found to be associated with milk yield and composition traits (P = 0.0441 to <0.0001). Significant additive and allele substitution effects were observed for three yield traits at all six loci as well (P < 0.05 to <0.01).

24055687,24055687,True but not false memories are associated with the HTR2A gene.,"Previous research reported that serotonin receptor 2A gene (HTR2A) polymorphisms were associated with memory. However, it is unknown whether these genetic variants were associated with both true and false memories. The current study of 336 Han Chinese subjects tested 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the HTR2A gene for potential associations with true and false memories. False memories were assessed using the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm, in which people falsely remember semantically related (but unpresented) words. We found that 11 SNPs within the HTR2A gene were associated with true memory (p=0.000076-0.043). The associations between true memory and seven adjacent SNPs (i.e., rs1923888, rs1745837, rs9567739, rs3742279, rs655888, rs655854, and rs2296972) were still significant after multiple testing corrections. Haplotype-based association analysis revealed that, true memory was positively associated with haplotype A-C-C-G-C-T-A for these seven adjacent SNPs (p=0.000075), which was still significant after multiple testing correction. Only one SNP rs655854 was associated with false memory (p=0.023), and it was not significant after multiple testing correction. This study replicates, in an Asian population, that genetic variation in HTR2A is associated with episodic memory, and also suggests that this association is restricted to true memory."

24014100,24014100,Association of imaging classification of intracranial cerebral atherosclerotic vascular stenosis in ischemic stroke and renalase gene polymorphisms.,"Cerebral atherosclerosis vascular stenosis is a common etiology for ischemic stroke and a major factor in recurrent stroke and vascular mortality. Recent studies suggest that renalase plays a role in hypertension and ischemic stroke, and may be involved in atherosclerosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether there were correlations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the renalase gene and severity of intracranial cerebral atherosclerotic vascular stenosis in ischemic stroke patients as determined by imaging. A total of 212 ischemic stroke patients and 244 healthy controls from the north Chinese Han population were enrolled in this study. Polymerase chain reaction and ligase detection reaction were used for SNP analysis. We classified the case samples by severity of the intracranial cerebral atherosclerotic vascular stenosis. Allele, genotype, and haplotype were analyzed in cases and controls, and logistic regression was used to adjust for bias due to conventional stroke risk factors. The allele and the genotype of rs10887800 in the renalase gene were both associated with severe intracranial cerebral atherosclerotic vascular stenosis (p = 0.013 and p = 0.049, respectively). No association was observed with severity for SNP rs2576178 or SNP rs2296545. Our findings show that the SNP rs10887800 in the renalase gene is closely associated with severe intracranial cerebral atherosclerotic vascular stenosis in ischemic stroke patients of north Chinese Han origin."

Patients often have poor prognosis due to therapeutic resistance and tumor recurrence. Identification of the genetic factors of GBM could be important contribution to early prevention of this disease. We genotyped 17 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) from nine genes in this study, including 72 cases and 302 controls. SNP genotyping was conducted using Sequenom MassARRAY RS1000. Statistical analysis of the association between tSNPs and GBM was performed using the χ (2) test and SNPStats software. The rs3829382 in FLT3 was associated with increased odds of developing GBM using the χ (2) test. When we analyzed tSNPs under different inheritance models, we found rs9642393 in EGFR increased odds of developing GBM in the dominant model. After stratification by gender, we found that rs12645561 in NEIL3 and rs2291427 in ALOX5 were associated with developing GBM. Polymorphisms within FLT3, EGFR, NEIL3, and ALOX5 may contribute to the occurrence of GBM in the Han Chinese population.

23994291,23994291,Association of HHIP polymorphisms with COPD and COPD-related phenotypes in a Chinese Han population.,"The hedgehog signaling pathway plays an important role in lung morphogenesis and cellular responses to lung injury. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and integrative genomics approaches have demonstrated the associations between HHIP polymorphisms and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and in non-Asian populations. Here we investigated whether HHIP polymorphisms would also be associated with COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes in a Chinese Han population. In the present case-control study a total of 680 COPD patients and 687 healthy control subjects were recruited. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1828591, rs13118928, rs6817273, rs10519717, rs12504628, rs13147758) were selected for genotyping. Allele frequencies and genotype distributions were compared between patients and controls. To estimate the strength of association, odds ratios (OR) (with 95% CI) were calculated and potential confounding variables were tested by using logistic regression analysis. Association between haplotypes and COPD outcome was also assessed. We identified that SNP rs12504628 was associated with FEV1/FVC ratio among cases (P=0.0460). Moreover, the HHIP SNP rs10519717 was associated with the severity of disease (adjusted P-value=0.0300). The six SNPs showed strong linkage disequilibrium (r(2)≥ 0.9). Three major haplotypes were observed but showed no significant difference between case and control groups (P=0.4532, 0.0875, and 0.3484, respectively). In conclusion, our study suggests that the HHIP gene may be involved in COPD susceptibility in Chinese Han population."

However, genetic susceptibility is believed to play a major role. Recently, Chu et al. conducted a genome-wide association study in a Chinese Han population and identified two novel GD susceptibility loci within 4p14 (rs6832151) and 6q27 (rs9355610). The objective of the study was to replicate these associations in a Japanese population. We analyzed rs6832151 and rs9355610 genotypes in a case-control study based on 457 Japanese AITD patients (286 GD and 171 HT patients) and 222 matched Japanese controls using the high-resolution melting and unlabeled probe methods. Case-control association studies were performed using the c² and Fisher's exact tests with Yates correction. We found a significant allelic association between AITD and rs9355610 located in 6q27 (p = 0.023). GD was significantly associated with this SNP (p = 0.0055), while HT showed no significant associations with any SNPs. Moreover, when patients with GD were stratified according to Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO), there were no allelic associations with GO. These findings suggest the presence of AITD susceptibilty genes, especially in distinct subgroups of GD, in or near 6q27."

23971939,23971939,"IRF5, but not TLR4, DEFB1, or VDR, is associated with the risk of ulcerative colitis in a Han Chinese population.","OBJECTIVE. IRF5, TLR4, DEFB1, and VDR genetic variations have been associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) in several European patient cohorts. As distinct genetic backgrounds may play a role in different ethnicities, we evaluated the effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes and their interactions in UC patients of Han Chinese descent. MATERIAL AND METHODS. DNA samples from 300 UC patients and 302 healthy control subjects from Peking Union Medical College Hospital were genotyped for 14 tag SNPs, which were selected based on haplotype analysis of IRF5, TLR4, DEFB1, and VDR. Multidimensionality reductions were used to explore gene-gene interactions. RESULTS. The only observed association with UC was for IRF5. On an allelic level, SNP rs3807306 was associated with UC risk (p = 6.7 × 10(-3)). On a genotypic level, the CC genotype of SNP rs3807306 (p = 0.03) was associated with protection from UC, and the AA genotype of SNP rs4728142 (p = 7.6 × 10(-3)) was associated with a risk of UC. In the haplotype analysis, GGATT was highly correlated with UC risk (p-Value = 2.0 × 10(-4)). No significant multilocus interactions were detected among these four genes. CONCLUSIONS. Our study confirmed the association of IRF5 with UC in Han Chinese patients. Han Chinese UC patients share part of their genetic susceptibility with Caucasian patients."

23954879,23954879,A genetic variant in pre-miR-27a is associated with a reduced breast cancer risk in younger Chinese population.,"Accumulating evidence has indicated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA precursors may have an effect on miRNA expression levels. Recently, an important A to G transition SNP in pre-mir-27a (rs895819) was identified. Previous studies have investigated the role of rs895819 in cancer risk, but the results remain contradictory, rather than conclusive. The present study aimed to evaluate the association of rs895819 with sporadic breast cancer susceptibility, clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis. We first analyzed the influence of rs895819 on the miR-27a expression level and determined that miR-27a expression was significantly lower in samples with the AG/GG genotype compared to samples with the AA genotype (p=0.022). Further investigation revealed that subjects with the G allele exhibited a significantly decreased risk of breast cancer relative to subjects carrying the A allele among the younger population (adjusted OR=0.628, 95% confidence interval 0.410-0.961; p=0.032). Moreover, significant associations between the presence of rs895819 and the histological grade and estrogen status of breast cancers were observed among the older group. However, the SNP did not influence the survival rate of patients with breast cancer. In conclusion, our results suggest that the SNP rs895819 may serve as a risk factor for breast cancer in younger Chinese populations; however, larger population-based studies are needed to validate these findings."

In the present study, we performed a genome-wide CNV identification in 14 individuals selected from diverse populations, including six types of Chinese indigenous breeds, one Asian wild boar population, as well as three modern commercial foreign breeds. We identified 63 CNVRs in total, which covered 9.98 Mb of polymorphic sequence and corresponded to 0.36% of the genome sequence. The length of these CNVRs ranged from 3.20 to 827.21 kb, with an average of 158.37 kb and a median of 97.85 kb. Functional annotation revealed these identified CNVR have important molecular function, and may play an important role in exploring the genetic basis of phenotypic variability and disease susceptibility among pigs. Additionally, to confirm these potential CNVRs, we performed qPCR for 12 randomly selected CNVRs and 8 of them (66.67%) were confirmed successfully. CNVs detected in diverse populations herein are essential complementary to the CNV map in the pig genome, which provide an important resource for studies of genomic variation and the association between various economically important traits and CNVs."

Additionally, we found that in subjects aged ≤ 50 years compared with common AA genotype, TFF2 rs3814896 AG+GG genotypes were associated with increased TFF2 mRNA levels in the total gastric cancer specimens and in the diffuse-type gastric cancer specimens; and in males aged ≤ 50 years compared with common GG genotype, TFF3 rs9981660 AA+AG genotypes were associated with TFF3 mRNA levels in diffuse-type gastric cancer tissues and their corresponding non-cancerous tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an association between the TFF2 rs3814896 AG+GG genotypes and decreased risks of GC, diffuse-type GC, and atrophic gastritis in younger people aged ≤ 50 years, and an association between TFF3 rs9981660 AG+AA genotype and decreased risk of diffuse-type GC in men. Moreover, we found that TFF2 rs3814896 AG+GG genotypes in people aged ≤ 50 years and TFF3 rs9981660 AG+AA genotypes in younger males with diffuse-type GC were associated with higher levels of TFF2 and TFF3 mRNA respectively."
23924835,23924835,Genetic variant in vitamin D binding protein is associated with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and vitamin D insufficiency in southern Chinese.,"Previous large-scale genome-wide meta-analysis identified four loci affecting 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations. However, whether these loci are associated with 25(OH)D concentration in southern Chinese remain unknown. Our primary aim was to examine whether the four top hits (rs2282679, rs10741657, rs12785878 and rs6013897) could be replicated in 712 southern Chinese women. The associations between these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), serum 25(OH)D concentration (continuous variable) and vitamin D insufficiency (dichotomized variable) were examined using multivariable linear regression and logistic regression, respectively. Age, body mass index and season were adjusted in the model. Among these four SNPs, rs2282679 was associated with serum 25(OH)D levels (β=-0.066; P=9 × 10(-5)) and vitamin D insufficiency (odds ratio (OR)=1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19-1.93; P=8.6 × 10(-4)), whereas rs12785878 was nominally associated with vitamin D insufficiency only (OR=0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.99; P=0.042). Genotype risk score (GRS), by summing risk variants of these two SNPs, had more significant association with vitamin D insufficiency (OR=1.38; 95% CI 1.17-1.64; P(trend)=1.76 × 10(-4)) than the model that included only either SNP. The areas under receiver operating characteristic curves of rs2282679 and GRS were 0.561 (P=0.005) and 0.576 (P=5 × 10(-4)), respectively. Our study provides an independent evidence of the associations of rs2282679 and probably rs12785878 with 25(OH)D and vitamin D insufficiency in southern Chinese."

23916661,23916661,Marginal association between SNP rs2046571 of the HAS2 gene and Parkinson's disease in the Chinese female population.,"Recent GWASs have implicated many novel SNPs in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2046571 of the HSA2 (encoding hyaluronan synthase 2) was reported to have marginal association with PD. Herein, we conducted a case-control study to evaluate the possible association between SNP rs2046571 and PD in Chinese. All subjects (1043 PD patient and 1044 normal control) were successfully genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. No statistically significant difference in genotype frequency between cases and controls was observed (P=0.074), no statistically significant difference in genotype frequency between early-onset and late-onset was observed (P=0.264 and P=0.120, respectively). No statistically significant difference in genotype frequency between male cases and controls (P=0.108). But surprisingly, there was statistically marginal significant difference in genotype frequency between female cases and controls (P=0.042). Our findings suggested that rs2046571 of the HSA2 has marginal association with PD in Chinese population."
23920366,23920366,Lack of association between primary angle-closure glaucoma susceptibility loci and the ocular biometric parameters anterior chamber depth and axial length.,"Three susceptibility loci for primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) were recently identified: PLEKHA7 rs11024102, COL11A1 rs3753841, and rs1015213 located in the intergenic region between PCMTD1 and ST18. The purpose of this study was to investigate the associations of these loci with the ocular biometric parameters anterior chamber depth (ACD) and axial length (AL)."

23909490,23909490,Polymorphisms in the ERCC1 and XPF genes and risk of breast cancer in a Chinese population.,"Inherited functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA repair genes may influence the capability of DNA repair and contribute to the risk of breast cancer. We therefore performed a case-control study to investigate the association of three in excision repair cross-complimentary group 1 (ERCC1) and three in xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group F (XPF) with the risk of breast cancer. Genotyping of ERCC1 (rs2298881, rs3212986, and rs11615) and XPF (rs2276465, rs6498486, and rs2276466) was performed in a 384-well plate format on the MassARRAY(®) platform. Odds ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were used to assess the effect of each SNP on breast cancer risk. The ERCC1 rs11615 variant A/A genotype was associated with increased breast cancer risk in codominant, dominant, and recessive models, and XPF rs6498486 variant C/C genotype carriers have a significantly increased breast cancer risk in codominant, dominant, and recessive models. Individuals with both the ERCC1 rs11615 A allele and XPF rs6498486 C allele had a heavy increased risk of breast cancer compared to double wild-type homozygotes. The present study shows that the ERCC1 rs11615 and XPF rs6498486 polymorphisms are associated with breast cancer risk in a Chinese population. Further large-scale studies are required to elucidate whether these ERCC1 and XPF SNPs interact with environmental factors in the development of breast cancer."
23937109,23937109,Interleukin-27 rs153109 polymorphism and the risk for immune thrombocytopenia.,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the interleukin-27 (IL-27) genes with the risk for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). In this case-control study, the genotyping of IL-27 rs153109 polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). In ITP patients, the frequencies of GG, GA and AA genotypes, and G and A alleles were 9.7%, 58.5%, 31.8%, 38.9% and 61.1%, respectively. There was no significant difference in genotype and alleles distribution between the ITP patient and the healthy controls (p = 0.68 and 0.80, respectively). Similar results were found between the two groups when stratified by the age and disease course including non-chronic adult, chronic adult, non-chronic childhood, and chronic childhood. In conclusion, the IL-27 polymorphism may not be involved in susceptibility to ITP in a Chinese population."
23911300,23911300,Polymorphisms in lipid metabolism related miRNA binding sites and risk of metabolic syndrome.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate posttranscriptional gene expression usually by binding to 3'-untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of target message RNAs (mRNAs). Previous studies have demonstrated that SNPs within miRNA target sites could modulate miRNA-mRNA interaction to affect the regulation of target genes and the individual's diseases. So far, little is known about the relationship of miRNA binding site polymorphisms with the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the general population. Therefore, we conducted a case-control study in Chinese Han population to evaluate the association between SNPs within miRNA binding sites and risk of MetS. 8 SNPs in miRNA binding sites with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of ≥ 0.05 in the Chinese Han population were selected by bioinformatics software. TaqMan ®assay was performed to test the genotypes in MetS patients (n=1026) and normal controls (n=1032). We found rs5750146 (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=1.24 for GA/AA, P=0.023, compared with GG), rs5999924 (adjusted OR=1.22 for AT/TT, P=0.038, compared with AA) in the APOL6 3'UTR were identified to correlate with MetS in the total sample and females. Rs11724758 (adjusted OR=0.65 for AA, P=0.002, compared with GG) in the FABP2 3'UTR was found to correlate with MetS in the total sample and males. Correlations between FABP2 rs11724758 polymorphisms and components of MetS reveal that high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) levels are significantly higher in FABP2 rs11724758 AA genotype carrier compared with noncarriers, whereas triglycerides (TG) and fasting plasma glucose (FG) were to be significantly lower in the AA genotype carrier. These findings indicate that these three polymorphisms which located at the predicted miRNAs binding sites were identified to contribute to susceptibility to MetS in the Chinese Han population."

23892089,23892089,Poly (AT) deletion/insertion polymorphism of the XPC gene contributes to urinary system cancer susceptibility: a meta-analysis.,"Numerous studies have investigated the association between xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C (XPC) poly (AT) deletion/insertion (PAT -/+) polymorphism and cancer susceptibility; however, the findings are inconsistent. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis based on 32 publications including 10,214 cases and 11,302 controls to acquire a more robust estimation of the relationship. We searched publications from MEDLINE, EMBASE and CBM which assessed the associations between XPC PAT -/+ polymorphism and cancer risk. We calculated pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) by using either fixed-effects or random-effects model. We found that individuals carrying the PAT +/+ genotype have significantly increased cancer risk (PAT +/+ vs."
23907641,23907641,Association of AHSG gene polymorphisms with ischemic stroke in a Han Chinese population.,"Previous studies have shown associations of fetuin-A (alpha2-Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein, AHSG) with various disorders, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and atherosclerosis. In this study, genotype and allele frequencies of the rs4918 SNP in the AHSG gene were examined in 380 patients with ischemic stroke and 350 healthy controls from a Northern Han Chinese population via the PCR-RFLP technique. Frequencies of the GG genotype and the G allele in AHSG (rs4918) were significantly higher in patients with ischemic stroke or atherosclerotic cerebral infarction than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated the significance of rs4918 in these patients, after adjustment for confounding factors (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that rs4918 SNPs of the AHSG gene are associated with a risk for ischemic stroke in a Northern Han Chinese population."
23924573,23924573,Common rs7138803 variant of FAIM2 and obesity in Han Chinese.,"Obesity causes severe healthcare problem worldwide leading to numerous diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. Previous Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) identified an association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7138803, on chromosome 12q13 and obesity in European Caucasians. Since the genetic architecture governing the obesity may vary among different populations, we investigate the variant rs7138803 in Chinese population to find out whether it is associated with obesity."
23876972,23876972,Replication study of RAD54B and GREB1 polymorphisms and risk of PCOS in Han Chinese.,"A previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) identified several susceptibility loci, with P-values about 10⁻⁵. In the present study, an independent cohort was used for a replication study to evaluate the association of RAD54B and GREB1 with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in the Han Chinese population. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), rs2930961 (RAD54B), rs12470971, rs11686574 and rs6740248 (GREB1), were genotyped in 1124 PCOS patients and 1067 healthy controls from the Han Chinese population. Real-time quantitative PCR by TaqMan-MGB probe assay was applied for genotyping. The allele and genotype frequencies of these four SNP were not significantly different in the replication cohort. However, the minor allele frequency of rs2930961 was significantly different in hyperandrogenism of PCOS. After meta-analysis by combining the results of these two studies, there was a non-significant trend for the association of rs2930961 (RAD54B) with PCOS. RAD54B and GREB1 gene polymorphisms may not be associated with PCOS in the Han Chinese population. Nevertheless, RAD54B may contribute to hyperandrogenism in PCOS patients."

We hypothesized that polymorphisms in methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MSRA: rs10903323 G/A) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA: rs699947 C/A, rs2010963 G/C, and rs3025039 C/T) contribute to CAD susceptibility."
23872232,23872232,Proopiomelanocortin gene polymorphisms and its association with meat quality traits by ultrasound measurement in Chinese cattle.,"Ultrasound technology was used to measure live animal meat traits instead of true carcass meat traits for beef production and cattle breeding by an increasing number of institutions. In this study, we analyzed the association between genetic polymorphisms of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and ultrasound measurement traits in Chinese cattle. Using direct DNA sequencing in 322 individuals of 7 different cattle subpopulation, 7 SNPs were identified for genotyping within 790bp region of intron 2 and exon 3 of POMC. 6586 T>G in intron 2 and 6769 C>T and 7216 C>T in exon 3 were significantly associated with ultrasound backfat thickness (UBF) (P<0.05) and ultrasound loin muscle area (ULMA) (P<0.01) in the total population; 6694 C>T, 6706 T>C, 6796 C>T and 6810 C>T in exon 3 were significantly associated with ULMA (P<0.0001) in the total population. These results clearly suggest that these SNPs of POMC be benefit for selection of individuals with good quality meat in Chinese cattle breeding program. Following validation in other populations and breeds, these markers could be incorporated into breeding programs to increase the rate of improvement in carcass and meat quality traits."
23874430,23874430,Variants in ZNRD1 gene predict HIV-1/AIDS disease progression in a Han Chinese population in Taiwan.,"Patients demonstrate notable variations in disease progression following human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We aimed to identify ZNRD1 and RNF39 genetic variants linked to AIDS progression. We conducted a genetic association study in HIV-1-infected Han Chinese patients residing in Taiwan. The clinical characteristics of 143 HIV-1-infected patients were measured, and patients were split into 2 groups: AIDS progression and AIDS non-progression. Genotyping of ZNRD1 and RNF39 was performed in all participants. We found that patients in the AIDS progression group had higher HIV-1 viral loads and lower CD4 cell counts than did patients in the AIDS non-progression group. The frequency of the AA genotype of ZNRD1 (rs16896970) was lower in the AIDS progression group than in the AIDS non-progression group. Patients with AA genotypes had lower levels of HIV-1 viral loads and higher levels of CD4 cell counts than did patients with AG+GG genotypes. AIDS progression in patients with the AA group is significantly different from that in patients with the AG and GG groups by using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The hazard ratio for progression was lower in the AA group than in the AG and GG groups. We identified a SNP that contributes to AIDS progression in HIV-1-infected patients in this population. This SNP had a significant protective influence on AIDS progression, and polymorphisms of the ZNRD1 gene may play a role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection."

23874846,23874846,Genetic variants in epidermal growth factor receptor pathway genes and risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer in a Chinese population.,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival, and is frequently dysregulated in esophageal and gastric cancers. Few studies have comprehensively examined the association between germline genetic variants in the EGFR pathway and risk of esophageal and gastric cancers. Based on a genome-wide association study in a Han Chinese population, we examined 3443 SNPs in 127 genes in the EGFR pathway for 1942 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs), 1758 gastric cancers (GCs), and 2111 controls. SNP-level analyses were conducted using logistic regression models. We applied the resampling-based adaptive rank truncated product approach to determine the gene- and pathway-level associations. The EGFR pathway was significantly associated with GC risk (P = 2.16×10(-3)). Gene-level analyses found 10 genes to be associated with GC, including FYN, MAPK8, MAP2K4, GNAI3, MAP2K1, TLN1, PRLR, PLCG2, RPS6KB2, and PIK3R3 (P<0.05). For ESCC, we did not observe a significant pathway-level association (P = 0.72), but gene-level analyses suggested associations between GNAI3, CHRNE, PAK4, WASL, and ITCH, and ESCC (P<0.05). Our data suggest an association between specific genes in the EGFR signaling pathway and risk of GC and ESCC. Further studies are warranted to validate these associations and to investigate underlying mechanisms."

23871946,23871946,SIRT1 gene polymorphisms are associated with growth traits in Nanyang cattle.,"Growth is under complex genetic control and uncovering the molecular mechanisms how the genes and polymorphisms affect economic growth traits, are important for successful marker-assisted selection and more efficient management strategies in commercial cattle populations. SIRT1 is a NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase that belongs to the class III histone deacetylases. It plays an important role in numerous fundamental cellular processes including gene silencing, DNA repair, and metabolic regulation. In addition, SIRT1 acts as an inhibitor of adipogenesis and has been associated with body weight regulation. The objective of the present study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of bovine SIRT1 using 1255 animals representing the five main Chinese breeds and to determine if these SNPs are associated with economically important traits in Nanyang cattle. The approach consisted of resequencing SIRT1 using a panel of DNA from unrelated animals of five different breeds and the process revealed five novel SNPs. SNPs g.17324T>C and g.17491G>A exhibited a high degree of linkage disequilibrium in all tested breeds. Seven major haplotypes accounting for 91.2% of the alleles were observed and the haplotype 'GCCGA' was the most common haplotype in NY, QC, LX and JX breeds. An association analysis was performed between the five SNPs and six performance traits. SNP g.-274C>G was demonstrated to have a strong effect on 24-months-old body weight and g.17379A>G polymorphism was related to 6 and 12-months-old body weight in NY population, although these effects did not remained significant after the Bonferroni correction. Our results provide evidence that polymorphisms in SIRT1 are associated with growth efficiency traits, and may be used for marker-assisted selection and management in feedlot cattle."
23864233,23864233,Association between serum uric acid and the metabolic syndrome among a middle- and old-age Chinese population.,"Our aim was to study whether there is causal association between serum uric acid and metabolic syndrome (MetS). A cross-sectional study was performed, including a total of 27,009 subjects (23,345 subjects having uric acid data) from the Dongfeng-Tongji Cohort study. The MetS was defined by the International Diabetes Foundation criteria of 2005. Association analysis was performed by logistic regression. A genetic risk score was calculated by adding the uric acid increasing alleles in two SNPs (rs11722228 in SLC2A9 and rs2231142 in ABCG2) which were identified from our genome-wide association study on uric acid levels. The causal association was examined by mendelian randomization analysis. Among a middle- and old-age Chinese population, serum uric acid concentrations were strongly associated with the risk of MetS and its several components (P < 0.0001). The effects were stronger in women than in men. Despite the lack of statistical significance, both SNPs exhibited a trend with increased MetS risk (rs11722228, OR = 1.06, 95 % CI 0.99-1.14; rs2231142, OR = 1.02, 95 % CI 0.95-1.10), consistent with their increasing uric acid effects. Each additional uric acid increasing allele in the genetic risk score was associated with 3 % increased MetS risk (OR = 1.03, 95 % CI 0.98-1.09; P = 0.23). Further adjustment for serum uric acid attenuated the trend of individual SNP and genetic risk score with increased MetS risk (all OR < 1.0). These findings suggested that serum uric acid was associated with MetS risk in a middle- and old-age Chinese population. Whether this association was causal remained to be investigated in the future studies."

23840567,23840567,The Association Study between Twenty One Polymorphisms in Seven Candidate Genes and Coronary Heart Diseases in Chinese Han Population.,"Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in multiple populations identified several genetic loci for coronary heart diseases (CHD). Here we utilized a 2-stage candidate gene association strategy in Chinese Han population to shed light on the putative association between several metabolic-related candidate genes and CHD. At the 1(st) stage, 190 patients with CHD and 190 controls were genotyped through the MassARRAY platform. At the 2(nd) stage, a larger sample including 400 patients and 392 controls was genotyped by the High Resolution Melt (HRM) method to confirm or rule out the associations with CHD. MLXIP expression level was quantified by the real time PCR in 65 peripheral blood samples. From the 21 studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of seven candidate genes: MLXIPL, MLXIP, MLX, ADIPOR1, VDR, SREBF1 and NR1H3, only one tag SNP rs4758685 (T→C) was found to be statistically associated with CHD (P-value = 0.02, Odds ratio (OR) of 0.83). After adjustment for the age, sex, lipid levels and diabetes, the association remained significant (P-value = 0.03). After adjustment for the hypertension, P-value became 0.20 although there was a significant difference in the allele distribution between the CHD patients with hypertension and the controls (P-value = 0.04, 406 vs 582). In conclusion, among the 21 tested SNPs, we identified a novel association between rs4758685 of MLXIP gene and CHD. The C allele of common variant rs4758685 interacted with hypertension, and was found to be protective against CHD in both allelic and genotypic models in Chinese Han population."

23838595,23838595,Expansive marker analysis replicating the association of glaucoma susceptibility with human chromosome loci 1q43 and 10p12.31.,"Three human chromosome loci (1q43, 10p12.31, and 12q21.31) were recently associated with the susceptibility to primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in a Japanese population; however, this was not replicated in three subsequent studies using South Indian, Afro-Caribbean, and Chinese populations. To identify genetic markers that are robustly associated across ethnic populations, numerous markers in addition to the six in the three reported loci were examined in this study. A total of 31 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were genotyped for 1115 Korean participants, and many neighboring SNPs were imputed using the Korean HapMap Project genotype data. Each SNP was statistically tested for association with POAG susceptibility by comparisons among 211 POAG patients with 904 unaffected controls. A strong and statistically significant association was found with a previously unreported SNP, rs7098387 (odds ratio, OR=2.0 (1.4-3.0), P=0.00038) at the 10p12.31 locus (where 11 SNPs were typed and 38 imputed) in contrast to the reported rs7081455, which was too poorly correlated with newly associated rs7098387 (r2=0.003, D'=0.40) to show association. Additionally, a modest association was observed with the reported rs693421 (OR=1.4 (1.1-1.7), P=0.0082) and several other SNPs located within and around ZP4 at the 1q43 locus (10 SNPs typed and 14 imputed). However, no association was observed with the reported rs7961953 SNP or any other SNPs at the 12q21.31 locus, upstream of TMTC2 (10 SNPs typed and 29 imputed). Accordingly, POAG susceptibility association was replicated using rs7098387 (C) rather than rs7081455 (T) at the 10p12.31 locus and additionally with rs693421 (T) at the 1q43 locus."
23831349,23831349,The relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms of the NTRK2 gene and sporadic Alzheimer's disease in the Chinese Han population.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, whose survival and function are affected by neurotrophins and their receptors. The impaired signaling pathway of brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin-related kinase B (BDNF/TrkB) is considered to play an important role in AD pathogenesis. To explore the association of polymorphisms within the NTRK2 gene (encoding TrkB) and sporadic AD (sAD), a case-control study was conducted in a Chinese Han cohort including 216 sAD patients and 244 control participants. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with four of them within the promoter region and one in intron, were selected and genotyped with a polymerase chain reaction-ligase detection reaction (PCR-LDR) method. No association was revealed between these SNPs or the haplotypes containing four promoter SNPs and the risk of sAD. The results of this study indicate that polymorphisms in the selected regions of the NTRK2 gene are unlikely to confer the susceptibility of sAD in the Chinese Han population."
23850577,23850577,Potentially functional polymorphisms in ATG10 are associated with risk of breast cancer in a Chinese population.,"Autophagy is a cellular process directed at recycling of cellular proteins and removal of intracellular microorganisms, which is important for balancing sources of energy at critical times in development and in response to nutrient stress. It has been reported to be a critical process in cancer initiation and progression. We hypothesized that genetic variants in critical genes of autophagy may be involve in the development of breast cancer. Thus, we systematically screened 14 potentially functional polymorphisms in six autophagy-related genes (ATG3, ATG5, ATG7, ATG10, and ATG12 and LC3) that are core components in autophagosome formation. We conducted a case-control study including 1064 breast cancer cases and 1073 cancer-free controls to evaluate the associations of these variants with breast cancer risk. We found that rs1864182 and rs10514231 in ATG10 were significantly associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer [odds ratios (OR)=0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61-0.96, P=0.023; and OR=0.75, 95% CI: 0.59-0.93, P=0.010, respectively]. Similar protective effects for both loci were observed between subgroups stratified by ages at diagnosis/recruitment, menarche and first live birth, and status of menopause, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR). These results suggest that genetic variants in ATG10 may implicate with breast cancer susceptibility in Chinese population. Further large and functional studies are needed to confirm our findings."
23828597,23828597,HDAC9 gene is associated with stroke risk in a Chinese population.,"A recent Genome-Wide Association study (GWAS) identified rs11984041 on HDAC9 gene to be significantly associated with stroke in a Caucasian population. However, whether HDAC9 gene also plays a role in other ethnicities is unknown. The current study was conducted to investigate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on HDAC9 gene and stroke risk in a Chinese population. Sixteen tagging SNPs for HDAC9 gene were genotyped in a Chinese population of 279 stroke cases and 984 controls from Changhai Hospital in Shanghai, China. The candidate region of HDAC9 investigated was on a haplotype block located between two recombination hotspots in the tail region of HDAC9, the only region harbouring significantly associated SNPs based on the previous GWAS. rs11984041 was not polymorphic in Chinese population. Two other SNPs, rs2389995 and rs2240419 on HDAC9 of chromosome 7q21.1, were significantly associated with large-vessel stroke risk, with P values of 0.035 and 0.042, respectively (Table 3). Individuals with risk allele (A) for rs2389995 and (T) for rs2240419 had increased risk of stroke (odds ratio [OR] = 1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.75; and OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.02-1.63), respectively. Multivariate analysis including both SNPs in the logistic regression model revealed independent association effects of each SNP, with a P = 0.013 and 0.010, respectively. The results from our studies indicate HDAC9 gene is significantly associated with large-vessel stroke risk in Chinese population. However, SNPs on HDAC9 gene display heterogeneity effects across different ethnic populations. Additional studies are needed to further evaluate our results."
23830383,23830383,Genetic variability in copper-transporting P-type adenosine triphosphatase (ATP7B) is associated with Alzheimer's disease in a Chinese population.,"Previous experiments demonstrated that transgenic mice carrying both amyloid precursor protein and mutant ATP7B transgenes reduce amyloid plaques and diminish plasma Abeta levels. These experiments showed that a structural change of ATP7B may affect Alzheimers disease (AD) susceptibility. In this study three missense SNPs in ATP7B gene (rs1801243, rs1801244, and rs1801249) were chosen to test whether they were associated with AD. We tested this hypothesis using a case control design. The experimental data showed that there was a significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for SNP rs1801249 (c.3419 T greater than C, Val1140Ala) in the case group (p = 0.014) but not in the control group and that there was an association between SNP rs1801249 and AD under a recessive model (p = 0.003). The data also showed that the genotype frequency distribution of the ATP7B c.1366 G greater than C polymorphism (rs1801244, Val456Leu) differed significantly between the AD patients and the normal subjects (p = 0.012). In addition, the frequency of the TGC haplotype of SNPs rs1801243, rs1801244, and rs1801249 was significantly higher in the AD patients compared with the normal subjects (p = 8.49×10-7). These observations suggested that genetic variations in the copper transporter gene ATP7B might contribute to AD pathogenesis in the Taiwanese population."
23829426,23829426,Genetic variation in Tanis was associated with elevating plasma triglyceride level in Chinese nondiabetic subjects.,The association of genetic polymorphisms of Tanis with triglyceride concentration in human has not been thoroughly examined.

23825321,23825321,A joint genomewide association analysis of pig leg weakness and its related traits in an F2 population and a Sutai population.,"To map genomic loci for leg weakness-related traits in pigs, leg scores and gait scores were recorded at 219 ± 18 d in a White Duroc × Erhualian F2 intercross population and a Chinese Sutai population. The biceps brachii muscle was dissected from the right front leg and its length and weight were measured after slaughter at 240 ± 3 d in the 2 populations. The 2 populations were genotyped using the Porcine SNP60 BeadChip, and genomewide association studies were performed on them separately and jointly. A total of 12 significant loci were detected in the 3 populations, including 6 at the 1% genomewide significant level on SSC7 and SSCX and 2 at the 5% genomewide significant level on SSC7 and SSCX. All of them confirmed the previous QTL findings except 1 locus for gait score of front legs on SSC5, which was reported for the first time. The most prominent locus was identified in a 2.15 Mb linkage disequilibrium block on SSC7 for both leg weakness and the growth of the biceps brachii muscle, which is worth further investigation. The significant SNP identified in the Sutai population could directly be explored in marker-assisted selection to improve leg soundness of the Sutai pig. As expected, it is generally more powerful to identify significant regions in the combined population compared with a single population. To our knowledge, this was the first genomewide association study for weight and length of the biceps brachii muscle in pigs."
23840727,23840727,IL23R gene confers susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis concomitant with uveitis in a Han Chinese population.,The interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R) has been shown to be associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in many different populations.

23826309,23826309,Genetic variations of GAK in two Chinese Parkinson's disease populations: a case-control study.,"Cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK) modifies α-synuclein expression levels and affects the susceptibility of Parkinson's disease (PD). The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1564282 of GAK gene has a significant association to the risk of PD among Caucasian populations. To date there is only one data with regards to ethnic Chinese from Mainland China. Here, we conducted a case-control study in two independent cohorts of Han Chinese populations from Taiwan and Singapore to validate this association. A total of 1,755 subjects (871 PD patients and 884 controls) were recruited. The results showed that neither the CT, TT genotypes nor the minor allele T of SNP rs1564282 were associated with PD among the subjects from Taiwan and Singapore as well as in the pooled analysis. Differences in our study population with regards to published literature may be due to epigenetic factors and gene-gene or gene-environmental interactions. Further studies in other Chinese populations will be of interest to validate these findings."
23819814,23819814,Association of genetic polymorphisms in matrix metalloproteinase-9 and coronary artery disease in the Chinese Han population: a case-control study.,Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) plays an important role in inflammation and matrix degradation involved in atherosclerosis and plaque rupture. The T allele of rs3918242 has been reported to lead to a high promoter activity and associate with the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD). And some studies have reported that the G allele of rs17576 might be associated with CAD. The aim of this study was to assess the association between the polymorphisms of the MMP-9 gene and CAD in the Chinese Han population.

23816930,23816930,Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) gene polymorphisms associated with increased susceptibility of human papillomavirus-16 infection in patients with cervical cancer.,To investigate the association between toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection among Chinese Han women with cervical cancer.
23813219,23813219,Interaction between PLA2R1 and HLA-DQA1 variants associates with anti-PLA2R antibodies and membranous nephropathy.,"Risk alleles at genome loci containing phospholipase A2 receptor 1 (PLA2R1) and HLA-DQA1 closely associate with idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) in the European population, but it is unknown whether a similar association exists in the Chinese population and whether high-risk alleles promote the development of anti-PLA2R antibodies. Here, we genotyped 2132 Chinese individuals, including 1112 patients with IMN and 1020 healthy controls, for three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within PLA2R1 and three SNPs within HLA genes. We also selected 71 patients, with varying genotypes, to assess for circulating anti-PLA2R antibody and for PLA2R expression in glomeruli. Three SNPs within PLA2R1 and one SNP within HLA-DQA1 strongly associated with IMN, and we noted gene-gene interactions involving these SNPs. Furthermore, these risk alleles strongly associated with the presence of anti-PLA2R antibodies and glomerular PLA2R expression. Among individuals who carried risk alleles for both genes, 73% had anti-PLA2R antibodies and 75% expressed PLA2R in glomeruli. In contrast, among individuals who carried protective genotypes of both genes, none had anti-PLA2R antibodies and glomerular expression of PLA2R was weak or absent. In conclusion, the interaction between PLA2R1 and HLA-DQA1 risk alleles associates with the development of IMN in the Chinese population. Individuals carrying risk alleles are predisposed to the generation of circulating anti-PLA2R autoantibodies, which may contribute to the development of IMN."
23820447,23820447,Polymorphism in PGLYRP-1 gene by PCR-RFLP and its association with somatic cell score in Chinese Holstein.,"Bovine peptidoglycan recognition protein 1 (PGLYRP-1), an important pattern recognition molecule (PRM) of the innate immune system, is an effector molecule in killing different microorganisms directly. To investigate whether the PGLYRP-1 gene was associated with mastitis and milk production traits in dairy cattle, the polymorphism of this gene was analyzed by PCR-RFLP in a population of 524 Chinese Holstein. A total of ten single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci were identified. The association analysis of single SNP locus showed that T-35A, T-12G and G+102C were significantly associated (P<0.05) with somatic cell score (SCS), while G+102C and G+649C were significantly associated (P<0.05) with 305-day milk yield. Association analysis between combined haplotypes and SCS, milk production traits indicated that H3H3 was associated with the lower SCS (P<0.01), and H2H2 was associated with the lower 305-day milk yield (P<0.01). These findings demonstrated that polymorphisms in PGLYRP-1 gene associated with mastitis resistance and 305-day milk yield, and the H3H3 would provide a useful genetic marker of combined haplotypes for mastitis resistance selection and breeding in Chinese Holstein."
23797815,23797815,PLCE1 rs2274223 A>G polymorphism and cancer risk: a meta-analysis.,"Phospholipase C epsilon 1 gene (PLCE1) encodes a phospholipase enzyme which regulates various physiological processes (cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis) and is supposed to play a critical role in carcinogenesis. Recently, a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs2274223 A>G) in PLCE1 was reported as a novel susceptibility locus for esophageal and gastric cancers by genome-wide association studies performed in Chinese population. However, individual association studies replicating this finding showed inconclusive results. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of eligible studies to derive precise estimation of the association of PLCE1 rs2274223 A>G polymorphism with cancer risk. We performed pooled analysis of 12 case–control studies including 7,622 cases and 9,555 controls. Odds ratios and 95 % confidence interval were calculated to assess strength of association in overall studies and in subgroup analysis stratified by ethnicity, cancer types, and source of controls. All statistical analyses were performed by MIX 2.0 software. We found that PLCE1 rs2274223 A>G polymorphism was significantly associated with increased risk of cancer in log additive/dominant model and at allele level (GG vs. AA: OR = 1.24, 95 % CI = 1.01–1.53, P = 0.039; AG vs. AA: OR = 1.24, 95 % CI = 1.16–1.32, P < 0.001; AG + GG vs. AA: OR = 1.22, 95 % CI = 1.12–1.34, P < 0.001; and G vs. A allele: OR = 1.15, 95 % CI = 1.05–1.25, P = 0.002). Further, stratified analysis showed elevated risk of only gastric and esophageal tumors. Sub-group analysis based on ethnicity suggests PLCE1 polymorphism conferred significant risk among Asian (Chinese) but not in Caucasian. In conclusion, PLCE1 rs2274223 polymorphism may be used as potential biomarker for cancer susceptibility particularly for esophageal/gastric cancer and for the Chinese population."

23792019,23792019,Association study of CD36 single nucleotide polymorphisms with essential hypertension in the Northeastern Han Chinese.,"We found that cluster determinant 36 (CD36) gene is up-regulated in essential hypertension (EH) patients in our former research, but the association between CD36 gene variations and EH has not yet been clearly demonstrated. The relationship between CD36 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and EH in the northeastern Han Chinese was examined in the present study through direct sequencing and genotype-detection. A total of 589 unrelated northeastern Han Chinese including 276 with EH and 313 controls were studied. SNPs in exon 7, exon 13 and intron 4 were detected using PCR-sequencing. The genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) or polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP). +216T/C, +273A/G, +132C/T, +217T/C, +212T/G and +233T/C polymorphisms were identified. Distributions of genotypes AA, GA and GG of +273A/G polymorphism were significantly different between EH group and the control group (χ2: 9.056, p=0.011) and G allelic frequency was higher in EH (p=0.006, OR=1.629, 95% CI [1.224-2.168]). Logistic regression analysis showed that +273A/G polymorphism was closely associated with blood pressure (BP) after adjusting for ages. When subclassified by sex, the genotype distribution of +273A/G (p=0.011) and allelic frequency of G allele (p=0.006) were significantly different between EH participants and controls in males, but not in females. Subgroup analysis performed by body mass index (BMI) suggested that the genotype distribution of +273A/G and allelic frequency were significantly different in non-obese group and non-obese men, but the associations were not significant (non-obese group: p=0.016, OR=1.664, 95% CI [1.459-2.409]; non-obese men: p=0.073, OR=1.898, 95% CI [1.033-3.487]). +273A/G polymorphism in CD36 gene was associated with EH, and +273G could be an independent predictor."

23776546,23776546,Meta-analysis indicates that the European GWAS-identified risk SNP rs1344706 within ZNF804A is not associated with schizophrenia in Han Chinese population.,"Recent genetic association studies have implicated several candidate susceptibility variants for schizophrenia among general populations. Rs1344706, an intronic SNP within ZNF804A, was identified as one of the most compelling candidate risk SNPs for schizophrenia in Europeans through genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and replications as well as large-scale meta-analyses. However, in Han Chinese, the results for rs1344706 are inconsistent, and whether rs1344706 is an authentic risk SNP for schizophrenia in Han Chinese is inconclusive. Here, we conducted a systematic meta-analysis of rs1344706 with schizophrenia in Chinese population by combining all available case-control samples (N = 12), including a total of 8,982 cases and 12,342 controls. The results of our meta-analysis were not able to confirm an association of rs1344706 A-allele with schizophrenia (p = 0.10, odds ratio = 1.06, 95% confidence interval = 0.99-1.13). Such absence of association was further confirmed by the non-superiority test (p = 0.0003), suggesting that rs1344706 is not a risk SNP for schizophrenia in Han Chinese. Detailed examinations of individual samples revealed potential sampling bias in previous replication studies in Han Chinese. The absence of rs1344706 association in Han Chinese suggest a potential genetic heterogeneity in the susceptibility of schizophrenia on this locus and also demonstrate the difficulties in replicating genome-wide association findings of schizophrenia across different ethnic populations."
23786590,23786590,Common variants in KCNQ1 confer increased risk of type 2 diabetes and contribute to the diabetic epidemic in East Asians: a replication and meta-analysis.,"We aimed to evaluate the effect of four common variants (rs2237892, rs2283228, rs2237895, and rs2237897) in KCNQ1 on susceptibility of type 2 diabetes (T2D) by performing a case-control study as well as a comprehensive meta-analysis. We genotyped these four variants in two sets of Chinese Han population, comprising a total of 2533 type 2 diabetic patients and 2643 nondiabetic controls. We also performed a meta-analysis of our results with published studies in East Asians, meanwhile assessing the population attributable risk (PAR) of these variants. By combining our case-control sets, a total of 45,204 T2D cases and 42,832 controls were included in the meta-analyses. The per-allele ORs ranged from 1.24 to 1.33, and the PARs ranged from 15.8% to 31.8%, with SNP rs2237892 being the most widely studied (16 articles containing a total of 38,338 cases and 35,907 controls), showing strongest association (per-allele OR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.28-1.39) and indicating the highest PAR (31.8%). This study confirmed the strong association between common variants in KCNQ1 and risk of T2D. Variants in KCNQ1 were among the leading genetic factors contributing to the overall burden of T2D in East Asians."
23773642,23773642,Association of STAT4 gene polymorphism with increased susceptibility of rheumatoid arthritis in a northern Chinese Han subpopulation.,"Several studies have reported STAT4 polymorphism is strongly associated with increased susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, a study from China showed no association between STAT4 and RA susceptibility in a Chinese Han subpopulation. Since the northern Hans are known to be genetically different from the southern Hans, the aim of this study was to investigate the association of STAT4 polymorphism with RA in a large cohort of a northern Chinese Han subpopulation."
23778016,23778016,Genetic analysis of common variants in the CMYA5 (cardiomyopathy-associated 5) gene with schizophrenia.,"Recently, CMYA5 was suggested as a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia based on two independent studies utilizing different ethnic samples. We designed a case-control study to examine whether 21 SNPs contained within CMYA5 were associated with the disorder in a western Han Chinese sample comprised of 488 schizophrenia patients and 516 healthy control subjects. The allele distribution of SNPs rs7714250, rs16877135 and rs13158477 showed significant association with schizophrenia (Puncorrected=0.008, Puncorrected=0.04, and Puncorrected=0.009, respectively) as well as the genotype distribution in the Cochran-Armitage trend test (Puncorrected=0.008, Puncorrected=0.037 and Puncorrected=0.011, respectively). After Bonferroni correction, rs7714250 showed a trend of association with schizophrenia both in allele distribution (Pcorrected=0.088) and genotype distribution (Pcorrected=0.088). Furthermore, significant associations were found in several two-, three-, four-, and five-SNP tests of haplotype analyses. Replications of the association of CMYA5 with schizophrenia across various studies suggest that it is very likely a potential common schizophrenia-related gene worldwide. Functional studies correlating CMYA5 with DTNBP1 and PKA warrant further investigation of the molecular basis of this gene in relationship to the signal transduction pathway(s) underlying the pathogenesis of schizophrenia."
23762340,23762340,Variation in inflammatory cytokine/growth-factor genes and mammographic density in premenopausal women aged 50-55.,"Mammographic density (MD) has been found to be an independent risk factor for breast cancer. Although data from twin studies suggest that MD has a strong genetic component, the exact genes involved remain to be identified. Alterations in stromal composition and the number of epithelial cells are the most predominant histopathological determinants of mammographic density. Interactions between the breast stroma and epithelium are critically important in the maturation and development of the mammary gland and the cross-talk between these cells are mediated by paracrine growth factors and cytokines. The potential impact of genetic variation in growth factors and cytokines on MD is largely unknown."

23755762,23755762,STAT4 is a genetic risk factor for systemic sclerosis in a Chinese population.,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an immune-mediated and complex genetic disease. An association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the STAT4 gene with SSc has been reported in European Caucasians, North Americans and Japanese. We undertook the current study to examine whether the STAT4 SNPs are also associated with susceptibility to SSc and SSc subsets in a Han Chinese population. A total of 453 Han Chinese patients with SSc and 534 healthy controls were examined in the study. The SNPs rs7574865, rs10168266 and rs3821236 of the STAT4 gene were examined with SNP TaqMan assays. The T-allele carriers of rs7574865 and rs10168266 were strongly associated with the presence of anti-topoisomerase I (ATA) and pulmonary fibrosis in SSc patients, as well as with diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc). The presence of anti-centromere (ACA) and limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) did not show significant association with any of the examined SNPs. The results were consistent with previous reports in other ethnic populations in supporting the notion that polymorphisms of STAT4 may play an important role in susceptibility to SSc. It also revealed different genetic aspects of SSc subsets in a Han Chinese population."

23749100,23749100,IL-10RB rs2834167 (A/G) polymorphism is associated with the susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus: evidence from a study in Chinese Han population.,"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a pleiotropic cytokine and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Unlike IL-10 protein, few studies have focused on the potential association between IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) and SLE. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of a single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2834167 (A/G), in IL-10R2 gene (IL-10RB) with SLE in a Chinese Han population. A total of 667 patients with SLE and 676 healthy controls were enrolled in the present study. IL-10RB rs2834167 (A/G) polymorphism was specified from genomic DNA using TaqMan genotyping assay on a 7300 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction system. We found that the frequency of A allele for rs2834167 in patients (44.53 %) was significantly higher than in controls (40.16 %) (χ (2) = 5.24, P = 0.022). Allele A was associated with a 1.196-fold (95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.026-1.394) greater risk for the occurrence of SLE compared with the G allele. And both genotypes AG and AA were associated with the susceptibility to SLE as compared with the GG genotype (AG versus GG, odds ratio (OR) = 1.332; 95 %CI, 1.047-1.696; AA versus GG, OR = 1.373; 95 %CI, 1.004-1.878). We also found a statistical significance in the dominant model (AA + AG versus GG, OR = 1.343; 95 %CI, 1.070-1.687). However, no significant evidence for the association of IL-10RB rs2834167 (A/G) polymorphism with any clinical manifestations was detected. Our observations indicate that IL-10RB rs2834167 (A/G) polymorphism may be a potential biomarker for susceptibility to SLE."

23761049,23761049,Association between PTCH1 polymorphisms and risk of neural tube defects in a Chinese population.,"SHH signaling pathway plays an important role in the formation of the neural plate and is involved in the regulation of the dorsoventral (DV) axis of the neural tube. Some neural tube defects (NTDs) may be caused through overactivation of the SHH signaling pathway. The PTCH1 gene, encoding a negative regulator of SHH signaling, affects neural tube closure in animal models. However, in humans, the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the PTCH1 gene and neural tube defects remains unclear."
23737189,23737189,IFNG polymorphisms are associated with tuberculosis in Han Chinese pediatric female population.,"Host genetic factors play a major role in determining differential susceptibility to human tuberculosis (TB), a re-emerging infectious disease throughout the world. Genetic variations in the IFNG gene coding for interferon gamma (IFN-γ), have been identified in TB patients. To investigate the association of the IFNG polymorphisms with TB susceptibility in Chinese pediatric population. A case-control study of 189 TB patients and 164 controls was performed using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes in peripheral blood. Three SNPs of IFNG, including -1616C/T (rs2069705), +874A/T (rs2430561), and +3234C/T (rs2069718), were selected for genotyping and analysis. The +874A and +3234C alleles were more frequent among TB patients (P = 0.108 and P = 0.088), especially in females (both P = 0.029), although this difference was not significant since Bonferroni corrected significance threshold was 0.025 (two of three SNPs were found to be in linkage disequilibrium). More pronounced differences for the +874 and +3234 polymorphisms were found under the genotype comparison between TB cases and controls in the total population [P = 0.026 (borderline non-significance) and P = 0.020, respectively], and in the female subgroup (P = 0.020 and P = 0.020). The dominant model of inheritance was shown to be significant for +874A and +3234C alleles (both P = 0.019) in the female subgroup. The +874A and +3234C alleles were more frequently found in extrapulmonary TB patients than in controls (P = 0.039). Haplotype analysis carried out on these three SNPs showed the TTT haplotype to be more frequent in controls than in TB cases, and this difference showed a strong significance (P = 0.005). The +874A and +3234C alleles may be related to TB susceptibility in the female subgroup in the Chinese pediatric population of North China. The higher rate of +874A (known to correlate with lower IFN-γ expression) in the extrapulmonary TB subgroup suggests a sufficient IFN-γ expression to be not only an important factor for the onset of TB disease but also for limiting its dissemination to lungs."
23735640,23735640,Lipoprotein lipase gene polymorphism rs1059611 functionally influences serum lipid concentrations.,Dozens of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene have been reported to be associated with lipid concentrations. The aim of this study was to validate the association between rs1059611 in the LPL gene and serum lipid concentrations in the Chinese Han population and explore the biological relevance.
23743782,23743782,Association between neurotensin receptor 1 gene polymorphisms and alcohol dependence in a male Han Chinese population.,"Neurotensin (NT) is a 13-amino acid multifunctional neuropeptide. Previous studies have demonstrated the roles of NT and its high-affinity receptor 1 (NTR1) in genetically mediated differential sensitivities to alcohol. However, no studies have investigated the association between NTR1 gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and alcohol dependence (AD). We therefore examined this link. We genotyped three SNPs (rs6090453C/G, rs6011914C/G, and rs2427422A/G) of NTR1 gene in 127 AD patients and 131 healthy controls drawn from Han Chinese males. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared, and linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analysis were performed. For rs6011914C/G, the frequencies of GG genotypes in AD patients showed an increased trend compared with controls (p = 0.057), and the ratio of GG/(CG + CC) for dominant model in AD patients was significantly higher (p = 0.024). For rs2427422A/G, both the frequencies of G alleles and GG genotypes and the ratio of GG/(AG + AA) for dominant model in AD patients were significantly higher compared with controls (p = 0.003, 0.006, 0.002, respectively). There was no significant difference in the frequencies of alleles, genotypes, and dominant or recessive model for rs6090453C/G (all p > 0.05). There were three pairs of SNP linkage disequilibriums, and the haplotype frequencies differed significantly between patients and controls for the CCA (p = 0.005, less frequent in the patients) and CCG (p = 0.002, more frequent in the patients) haplotypes. The current study supported an association between NTR1 gene variants and AD in the Han Chinese population."

23726717,23726717,Association between SYP with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in Chinese Han subjects: differences among subtypes and genders.,"Dysfunction of neurotransmitters has been suggested to be involved in the etiology of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Hence, genes encoding proteins involved in the vesicular release process of those neurotransmitters are attractive candidates in ADHD genetics. One of these genes is SYP, which encodes synaptophysin, a protein known to participate in regulating neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. Several studies have reported an association between SYP and ADHD, but more work is needed to refine the association. In the present study, we attempt to investigate their association in Chinese Han subjects by family-based and case-control studies. Transmission disequilibrium tests (TDTs) in 1112 trios found significant association between SYP and the predominantly inattentive subtype (ADHD-I), especially for males with ADHD-I, both from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and haplotypic analyses. Chi-square tests in 1682 ADHD probands and 957 comparison subjects indicated possible association of SYP with female ADHD and female ADHD-I. However, the associated alleles and haplotypes between males and females were reversed. In conclusion, our results suggested that SYP may be primarily associated with ADHD-I and its genetic mechanism may be gender-specific. Thus, it is necessary to take subtype and gender into account in ADHD genetic studies."

23720677,23720677,Genetic variants in pseudogene E2F3P1 confer risk for HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma in a Chinese population.,"Recent studies showed that pseudogenes can regulate the expression of their coding gene partners by competing for miRNAs. The E2F family plays a crucial role in the control of cell cycle checkpoint. E2F3P1 is a pseudogene of E2F3. Few studies focused on genetic variations on pseudogenes. In this study, we performed a case-control study to assess the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in E2F3P1 and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in 1050 hepatitis B virus (HBV)-positive HCC cases and 1050 chronic HBV carriers. Logistic regression analysis was applied to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between genotypes and HCC risk. We found that the variant CT/TT genotypes of rs1838149 were associated with a significantly decreased risk of HCC (adjusted OR = 0.66, 95% CIs = 0.51-0.86, P = 0.002) compared to those with wildtype CC homozygote. Furthermore, the AA genotype of rs9909601 had an increased HCC risk with an adjusted OR of 1.41 (95% CIs = 1.07-1.86), and the A allele of rs9909601 was significantly associated with HCC risk compared to those with the G allele (adjusted OR = 1.17, 95% CIs = 1.03-1.33, P = 0.017). These results indicate that genetic variations in the pseudogene E2F3P1 may confer HCC risk."

Recent genome-wide association studies found that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3825214 in T-box 5 (TBX5) was positively associated with PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and common arrhythmia disorders such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and advanced atrioventricular block. However, other independent replication studies are required to validate the result. This study assessed associations between rs3825214 and ECG parameters, AF, and ventricular tachycardia (VT) in a Chinese Han population."

Genotype frequencies of five SNPs (rs3020449, rs3020450, rs2987983, rs1271572 and rs1887994) in the promoter region of the ERβ gene in 873 women with breast cancer, 645 women with fibroadenoma and 700 healthy women were determined using an allele-specific tetra-primer polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to evaluate the association of selected rs1271572 with prognosis in breast cancer. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays were conducted to explore the binding of SNP rs1271572 containing probes to transcriptional factor Ying Yang 1 (YY1)."
23727609,23727609,Replication study of STAT4 rs7574865 G/T polymorphism and risk of rheumatoid arthritis in a Chinese population.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are common systemic autoimmune diseases with genetic and environmental predisposing factors. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) transmits signals induced by interleukin-12, interleukin-23 and interferon-γ, which are key cytokines and play important roles in the development of autoimmune diseases. Previous studies confirmed the STAT4 rs7574865 G/T locus to be associated with RA. Thus we conducted a replication study to investigate STAT4 rs7574865 G/T polymorphism and RA/AS susceptibility in a Chinese population."
23720676,23720676,Genome-wide analysis of runs of homozygosity identifies new susceptibility regions of lung cancer in Han Chinese.,"Runs of homozygosity (ROHs) are a class of important but poorly studied genomic variations and may be involved in individual susceptibility to diseases. To better understand ROH and its relationship with lung cancer, we performed a genome-wide ROH analysis of a subset of a previous genome-wide case-control study (1,473 cases and 1,962 controls) in a Han Chinese population. ROHs were classified into two classes, based on lengths, intermediate and long ROHs, to evaluate their association with lung cancer risk using existing genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. We found that the overall level of intermediate ROHs was significantly associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer (odds ratio = 0.63; 95% confidence interval: 0.51-0.77; P = 4.78×10(-6) ), while the long ROHs seemed to be a risk factor of lung cancer. We also identified one ROH region at 14q23.1 that was consistently associated with lung cancer risk in the study. These results indicated that ROHs may be a new class of variation which may be associated with lung cancer risk, and genetic variants at 14q23.1 may be involved in the development of lung cancer."
23696856,23696856,Association between polymorphisms of the IL-23R gene and allergic rhinitis in a Chinese Han population.,"Polymorphism of the interleukin-23 receptor gene corresponds with susceptibility to several immune-related diseases. For the terminal differentiation of IL-17-producing effector T-helper cells in vivo, the interleukin-23 receptor gene is of vital importance. As shown recently, Th17 cells probably have a great influence on the pathogenesis of allergic airway diseases. Our intention was to establish an association between polymorphisms in the IL-23R gene and allergic rhinitis (AR) in the Chinese Han population."
23696934,23696934,Genetic distribution and association analysis of DRD2 gene polymorphisms with major depressive disorder in the Chinese Han population.,"Dopamine D2 receptor is involved in reward-mediating mesocorticolimbic pathways. It plays an important role in major depressive disorder (MDD). Three gene polymorphisms Taq1A, C957T and -141C ins/del, were identified in the DRD2 gene among the Western population. These variants in the DRD2 gene might be associated with the susceptibility of MDD patients through affecting the bioeffects of endogenous dopamine neurotransmission. However, little is known about their occurrence in Chinese population and their association with the susceptibility of patients with major depressive disorder. In this study, a total of 338 unrelated adult Chinese Han population, including 224 healthy volunteers and 114 patients with major depressive disorder, were recruited. DRD2 polymorphisms (Taq1A and -141C ins/del) were detected using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and the C957T were detected by sequencing directly. As a result, three polymorphisms were identified in Chinese Han population and all were common SNP. However, we could detect no evidence of genetic association between 3 markers in DRD2 and major depressive disorder in the Chinese Han population. To conclude, this result suggests that Taq1A, C957T and -141C ins/del of DRD2 gene may not be associated with major depressive disorder, also may be the sample sizes too small to allow a meaningful test."
23714748,23714748,A panel of ancestry informative markers to estimate and correct potential effects of population stratification in Han Chinese.,"Population stratification acts as a confounding factor in genetic association studies and may lead to false-positive or false-negative results. Previous studies have analyzed the genetic substructures in Han Chinese population, the largest ethnic group in the world comprising ∼20% of the global human population. In this study, we examined 5540 Han Chinese individuals with about 1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and screened a panel of ancestry informative markers (AIMs) to facilitate the discerning and controlling of population structure in future association studies on Han Chinese. Based on genome-wide data, we first confirmed our previous observation of the north-south differentiation in Han Chinese population. Second, we developed a panel of 150 validated SNP AIMs to determine the northern or southern origin of each Han Chinese individual. We further evaluated the performance of our AIMs panel in association studies in simulation analysis. Our results showed that this AIMs panel had sufficient power to discern and control population stratification in Han Chinese, which could significantly reduce false-positive rates in both genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and candidate gene association studies (CGAS). We suggest this AIMs panel be genotyped and used to control and correct population stratification in the study design or data analysis of future association studies, especially in CGAS which is the most popular approach to validate previous reports on genetic associations of diseases in post-GWAS era."
23688607,23688607,Novel functional variants locus in PLCE1 and susceptibility to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: based on published genome-wide association studies in a central Chinese population.,"A novel functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2274223 located in the phospholipase C epsilon 1 (PLCE1) gene was found to be associated with the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) by three large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Chinese populations. In the present study, we validated this finding and also explored the risk of ESCC associated with other two unreported potentially functional SNPs (rs17417407 G>T and rs2274224 C>G) of PLCE1 in a population-based case-control study to investigate the association between these three potentially functional SNPs in PLCE1 and susceptibility to ESCC. A total of 381 ESCC cases and 420 controls matched by age and sex were recruited and successfully genotyped for three SNPs (rs17417407, rs2274223 and rs2274224) of the PLCE1 in a central Chinese population. SNP rs2274223 was independently associated with increased risk of ESCC (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.80; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.45-5.39 for GG vs. AA), and SNP rs2274224 was found to be associated with decreased risk of ESCC (adjusted OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46-0.91 for CG vs. CC). The combined effects of risk alleles for three SNPs (rs17417407T, rs2274223G and rs2274224G) were found to be associated with elevated risk of ESCC in a dose-dependent effect manner (Ptrend=0.005). The Grs17417407Ars2274223Crs2274224 haplotype decreased the risk of ESCC (adjusted OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62-0.93), meanwhile the Grs17417407Grs2274223Crs2274224 and Trs17417407Grs2274223Crs2274224 haplotypes could increase the risk of ESCC (adjusted OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.33-2.18 and OR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.15-2.49). Gene-environment interaction analysis presented a best model consisted of four factors (rs2274223, rs2274224, family history, and smoking) with testing balance accuracy (TBA): 0.66 and cross validation consistency (CVC): 7/10, which could increase the esophageal cancer risk in the ""high risk group"" with 3.67-fold (OR: 3.67, 95% CI: 2.74-4.92), compared to the ""low risk group"". Our results further confirmed that genetic variations in PLCE1 may contribute to ESCC risk associated with tobacco exposure in a central Chinese population. Further functional studies are needed to validate our results."
23710540,23710540,Analysis of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) G894T polymorphism and semen parameters in a Chinese Han population.,"Previous studies have shown that endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene may be involved in abnormal semen parameters. However, the relationship between eNOS G894T polymorphism and semen parameters remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of eNOS G894T polymorphism and semen parameters. The genotype frequency of eNOS G894T was determined in 270 idiopathic asthenozoospermia patients and 248 ethnically matched healthy volunteers using iPLEX genotyping assays on a MassARRAY(®) (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA) platform. The statistical analysis performed with Fisher's exact test showed no significant difference in frequencies of genotypes between both groups. The logistic regression showed that genotypes GT, TT and allele T were nonassociated with increased risk of asthenozoospermia in the patient group with ≤5% or >5% sperm with normal forms. The dependence on genotypes of semen parameters was further investigated in both patients and control group. There was no significant difference as compared to control group (P > 0.05). Our study indicated that eNOS gene G894T polymorphism may not have an adverse effect on semen parameters in a Chinese Han population."

23679257,23679257,Genetic screening for mutations in the chip gene in intracranial aneurysm patients of Chinese Han nationality.,We performed a case-control study to investigate whether SNPs of CHIP might affect the development of IA in Chinese Han nationality. We believe we are the first to have screened IA patients for mutations in the CHIP gene to determine the association with these variants. The study group comprised 224 Chinese Han nationality patients with at least one intracranial aneurysm and 238 unrelated healthy Han nationality controls. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood leukocytes. The entire coding regions of CHIP were genotyped by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. Differences in genotype and allele frequencies between patients and controls were tested by the chi-square method. Genotype and allele frequencies of the SNP rs116166850 was demonstrated to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. No significant difference in genotype or allele frequencies between case and control groups was detected at the SNP. Our data do not support the hypothesis of a major role for the CHIP gene in IA development in the Chinese Han population.
23666058,23666058,Genetic differ in TLR4 gene polymorphisms and expression involved in Salmonella natural and artificial infection respectively in Chinese native chicken breeds.,"Salmonella enteritidis (SE) is a foodborne pathogen that negatively affects both animal and human health. Genetic variations in response to pathogenic SE colonization or to SE vaccination were measured in chicken resource populations. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is part of a group of evolutionarily conserved pattern recognition receptors involved in the activation of the immune system in response to various pathogens and in the innate defense against infection. In this study, TLR4 was investigated the association of TLR4 gene polymorphisms with Salmonella natural infection situation of birds from two distinct Chinese genetic breeds. One SNP G1894C in the second intron of chicken TLR4 (chTLR4) was scanned in the two hens breed, which showed significant association with Salmonella natural infection situation (P<0.05). Genetic variations in response to pathogenic SE colonization also existed in distinct Chinese chicken resource population. In this study, mRNA expression of TLR4 was detected to investigate the association with the effect of artificial SE challenge in heterophil granulocytes and spleen of chicks from two distinct Chinese genetic breeds at 1, 3 and 10 day post-infection during the acute infection period. It clearly showed that young chicks' response to SE infection was regulated by TLR4 mRNA expression. The results suggest that genetics, time, gender, and interactions among these factors, play important roles in TLR4 mRNA basic values and copies modulation of SE mediated immune response in distinct Chinese chickens."
23712400,23712400,SNP rs6265 regulates protein phosphorylation and osteoblast differentiation and influences BMD in humans.,"Bone mineral density (BMD) is a major index for diagnosing osteoporosis. PhosSNPs are nonsynonymous SNPs that affect protein phosphorylation. The relevance and significance of phosSNPs to BMD and osteoporosis is unknown. This study aimed to identify and characterize phosSNPs significant for BMD in humans. We conducted a pilot genomewide phosSNP association study for BMD in three independent population samples, involving ∼5000 unrelated individuals. We identified and replicated three phosSNPs associated with both spine BMD and hip BMD in Caucasians. Association with hip BMD for one of these phosSNPs, ie, rs6265 (major/minor allele: G/A) in BDNF gene, was also suggested in Chinese. Consistently in both ethnicities, individuals carrying the AA genotype have significantly lower hip BMD than carriers of the GA and GG genotypes. Through in vitro molecular and cellular studies, we found that compared to osteoblastic cells transfected with wild-type BDNF-Val66 (encoded with allele G at rs6265), transfection of variant BDNF-Met66 (encoded with allele A at rs6265) significantly decreased BDNF protein phosphorylation (at amino acid residue T62), expression of osteoblastic genes (OPN, BMP2, and ALP), and osteoblastic activity. The findings are consistent with and explain our prior observations in general human populations. We conclude that phosSNP rs6265, by regulating BDNF protein phosphorylation and osteoblast differentiation, influences hip BMD in humans. This study represents our first endeavor to dissect the functions of phosSNPs in bone, which might stimulate extended large-scale studies on bone or similar studies on other human complex traits and diseases."

23660633,23660633,No association of SORT1 gene polymorphism with sporadic Alzheimer's disease in the Chinese Han population.,"Increasing evidence shows that sortilin (encoded by SORT1 gene), a member of the vacuolar protein sorting 10 family of sorting receptors, can modulate amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) metabolism and clearance, as well as mediate the neurotoxicity of the Aβ oligomer and proneurotrophins, thus playing diverse roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. To assess the association between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the SORT1 gene and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) in the Chinese Han population, a case-control study was carried out including 220 sAD patients and 245 controls. One tag SNP was selected from the entire SORT1 gene through construction of linkage disequilibrium blocks, and three SNPs located in the vicinity of SORT1 that affect its expression were also selected. The four target SNPs were genotyped using a multiplex PCR-ligase detection reaction method, yielding no significant association between them or haplotypes containing three of them, and the risk of sAD. The results of this study indicate that polymorphisms of the SORT1 gene are unlikely to confer the risk of sAD in the Chinese Han population."

23658731,23658731,SNP set association analysis for genome-wide association studies.,"Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a promising approach for identifying common genetic variants of the diseases on the basis of millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In order to avoid low power caused by overmuch correction for multiple comparisons in single locus association study, some methods have been proposed by grouping SNPs together into a SNP set based on genomic features, then testing the joint effect of the SNP set. We compare the performances of principal component analysis (PCA), supervised principal component analysis (SPCA), kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), and sliced inverse regression (SIR). Simulated SNP sets are generated under scenarios of 0, 1 and ≥ 2 causal SNPs model. Our simulation results show that all of these methods can control the type I error at the nominal significance level. SPCA is always more powerful than the other methods at different settings of linkage disequilibrium structures and minor allele frequency of the simulated datasets. We also apply these four methods to a real GWAS of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Han Chinese population."

A total of 405 Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes and stroke were assessed in a 4-year follow-up case-control study. Patient response to antiplatelet therapy was measured with the Platelet Function Analyzer-100 by means of collagen/adenosine diphosphate (CADP) and collagen/epinephrine (CEPI) cartridges. The primary end point was a composite of stroke and TIA (transient ischemic attack), the secondary end point was death. The -866G>A polymorphism in UCP-2 was genotyped by TaqMan MGB probe method. The -866G>A SNP in UCP-2 was not significantly associated with recurrence of diabetic ischemical stroke (p = 0.57). A significant trend toward nonfull response to antiplatelet therapy was seen in patients carrying A allel in comparison with those carrying GG genotype, as shown by the CADP and CEPI tests (p < 0.0001). Our 4-year follow-up study shows no association between -866G>A variant of UCP-2 in type 2 diabetes and the risk of developing stroke. But in conclusion, the A allel is associated with clopidogrel resistance."

We carried out a case-control study in Chinese AS cohorts involving 278 AS patients and 286 unrelated healthy controls. Five TNAP SNPs (rs3200254, rs1256348, rs1472563, rs1780329, rs3767155) and four ANKH SNPs (rs25957, rs26307, rs27356, rs28006) were genotyped by the Multiplex Snapshot method. There were significant differences in genotype (permutated p = 0.00481) and allele (permutated p = 0.0126) frequencies of the rs26307 ANKH SNP between AS patients and controls. Logistic regression analysis suggested an association of AS with the polymorphism in an additive model (OR = 0.640, 95%CI = 0.480-0.853, p = 0.0023, permutation 10,000 corrected p = 0.0158) and a dominant model (OR = 0.599, 95%CI = 0.423-0.846, p = 0.0037, permutation 10,000 corrected p = 0.022). Haplotype analysis identified the ANKH haplotype rs26307(C)/rs27356 (T) as a predisposing factor for AS (OR = 1.53, 95%CI = 1.165-2.071, p = 0.0026, permutation 10,000 corrected p = 0.0103).

23629745,23629745,Evaluation of genetic variants in microRNA biosynthesis genes and risk of breast cancer in Chinese women.,"MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of small, noncoding RNA molecules involved in a diversity of cellular functions. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA biosynthesis genes may affect the biogenesis of miRNAs and consequently affect the miRNAs regulation. In this study, we systematically selected 24 functional SNPs located in eight key biosynthesis genes of miRNA (DROSHA, DGCR8, RAN, DICER, AGO2, GEMIN3, GEMIN4 and HIWI) and investigated the association between these SNPs and the risk of breast cancer in a Chinese population. All 24 SNPs were firstly genotyped in stage 1 (878 cases and 900 controls) and three promising SNPs (DROSHA rs2291109, RAN rs7301722 and DGCR8 rs417309) were selected for further validation in stage 2 (914 cases and 967 controls). We found that only one SNP (rs417309) located in the 3'-UTR of DGCR8 was consistently associated with an increased breast cancer risk in two stages with a combined odds ratio (OR) of 1.50 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.16-1.93]. Based on the bioinformatics prediction, rs417309 is located at the binding sites of miR-106b and miR-579 in the 3'-UTR of DGCR8. To evaluate whether rs417309 variant affects the binding capacity of miRNAs, we cotransfected luciferase reporter plasmids of DGCR8 3'-UTR and miR-106b/miR-579 in three cell lines. Luciferase activity assay showed a higher expression level with rs417309 A allele compared with G allele in MCF-7 cell lines (p = 3.31 × 10(-7) , 9.29 × 10(-7) for miR-106b and miR-579, respectively).

23674219,23674219,Genetic variants in the JAK1 gene confer higher risk of Behcet's disease with ocular involvement in Han Chinese.,"Recent surveys have identified SLC22A4, SLC22A5, RUNX1, JAK1 as susceptibility genes for various immune-related diseases. An association study was performed in 738 Behcet's patients with ocular involvement and 1,873 controls using the iPLEX system method. The first-stage study for 30 SNPs showed that SNPs rs2780815, rs310241, rs3790532 in JAK1 were associated with Behcet's disease in Han Chinese (Pc(Bonferroni correction) = 0.022-7.7 × 10(-3)). The G allele and AA genotype of SNP rs2834643 in RUNX1 (Pc = 0.041-1.75 × 10(-3)), but none of the other SNPs, were associated with Behcet's disease. Haplotype analysis for the SLC22A4, SLC22A5 genes showed an increased tendency for AGTCTGCCGC frequency in patients compared with controls; however, the significance was lost after Bonferroni correction (P = 0.004, Pc > 0.05). Subsequently, we further replicated the significantly associated SNPs using another independent cohort. Replication and combining studies showed that three SNPs rs2780815, rs310241, rs3790532 in JAK1, but not SNP rs2834643 in RUNX1, were consistently associated with Behcet's disease (replication: Pc = 0.012-9.60 × 10(-4); combining: Pc = 0.030-1.90 × 10(-4)). SNPs rs2780815, rs310241, rs3790532 were estimated to confer a population attributable risk of 35.0, 28.0, 27.0 %, respectively. We found a strong association between HLA-B51 with Behcet's disease in Chinese Han population (P = 1.35 × 10(-73); OR = 5.15; 95 % CI 4.28-6.19). GMDR analysis showed that no gene-gene interaction was detectable between JAK1 and HLA-B51. Logistic analysis indicated that the JAK1 gene was an independent risk factor for Behcet's disease (P > 0.05). Real-time PCR analysis showed that no difference on the expression of JAK1 in PBMCs or LPS-stimulated PBMCs between individuals with the different rs1762780815 genotypes studied (P > 0.05). In conclusion, this study suggests that JAK1, but not SLC22A4, SLC22A5 and RUNX1, contributes to the genetic susceptibility to Behcet's disease with ocular involvement."
23609471,23609471,Association between a novel polymorphism (rs2046210) of the 6q25.1 locus and breast cancer risk.,"The novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2046210, was identified in a breast cancer genome-wide association study of Chinese women. The SNP is located on 6q25.1 in proximity to the C6orf97 and estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) genes. To replicate this susceptibility, a number of case-control studies have been conducted in various populations. However, some results were inconclusive due to the restriction of sample size or ethnic diversity. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship between rs2046210 and genetic risk of breast cancer, we performed the first comprehensive meta-analysis which included 121,494 cases and 119,295 controls from 14 published studies. Overall, significant increased risk between the A allele of rs2046210 and breast cancer was found in the total population (allelic model: OR = 1.16, 95 %CI = 1.11-1.21, P heterogeneity < 0.0001; dominant model: OR = 1.22, 95 %CI = 1.14-1.29, P heterogeneity < 0.0001; recessive model: OR = 1.21, 95 %CI = 1.13-1.29, P heterogeneity < 0.0001). When stratified by ethnicity, significant elevated risk was found among Europeans and Asians. However, no significant association was detected in African descent population. In the subgroup analyses according to estrogen receptor (ER) positive/negative status, our results suggested that this polymorphism tended to increase breast cancer risk in ER negative tumors by a greater magnitude compared to ER positive tumors. In addition, our subgroup analysis also indicated that this SNP was significantly associated with the risk of breast cancer for BRCA1 mutation carriers and exhibited weaker association with the risk for BRCA2 mutation carriers. Substantial heterogeneity was present in the overall analysis, but largely disappeared after stratification by ethnicity. Despite some limitations, this meta-analysis demonstrates that the rs2046210 polymorphism may be a risk factor associated with increased breast cancer risk. However, the association varies in different ethnicities."
23608171,23608171,"Association of three polymorphisms in ARID5B, IKZF1 and CEBPE with the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a Chinese population.","Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that focus on childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common malignancy in children younger than 15 years old, have found evidence that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IKZF1 (7p12.2), ARID5B (10q21.2) and CEBPE (14q11.2) are strongly related to the risk of childhood ALL. These polymorphisms may lead to abnormal expression and dysfunction of the corresponding transcription factors and are likely to increase the risk of ALL. To validate the relationship between these SNPs and the risk of childhood ALL in Chinese population, we conducted a case-control study of 570 ALL cases and 673 controls. We determined that the SNP rs10821936 in ARID5B was statistically significantly associated with the risk of childhood ALL (P<0.0001). The results were also significant for the subgroup analysis of high-risk, medium-risk and low-risk ALL as well as B-lineage ALL. Statistically significant differences were not found in the SNPs for IKZF1 and CEBPE. In conclusion, ARID5B rs10821936 could serve as a potential biomarker for assessing the risk of childhood ALL in Chinese children."
23615473,23615473,LILRA3 is associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia risk in a Chinese Population.,"A recent prostate cancer (PCa) genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified rs103294, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located on LILRA3, a key component in the regulation of inflammatory inhibition, to be significantly associated with PCa risk in a Chinese population. Because inflammation may be a common etiological risk factor between PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), the current study was conducted to investigate the association of rs103294 with BPH risk. rs103294 was genotyped in a Chinese population of 426 BPH cases and 1,008 controls from Xinhua Hospital in Shanghai, China. Association between rs103294, BPH risk and clinicopathological traits were tested with adjustment for age. rs103294 was significantly associated with BPH risk with a p-value of 0.0067. Individuals with risk allele ""C"" had increased risk for BPH (OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.09-1.66). Stratified analysis revealed a stronger association risk for younger patients who are below 72 years old (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.06-2.16). Our study represents the first effort to demonstrate that LILRA3 gene is significantly associated with BPH risk in a Chinese population. Our results support a common role of inflammation in the development of PCa and BPH. Additional studies are needed to further evaluate our results."

23576140,23576140,Is susceptibility locus for lung cancer in the 15q25 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene cluster CHRNA5-A3-B4 associated with risk of gastric cancer?,"An association between common variants in the 15q25 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) gene cluster CHRNA5-A3-B4 (responsible for encoding nAChR subunits) and lung cancer risk has recently been reported in both Caucasian and Chinese population. Cigarette smoking is one of the major risk factors for both lung and gastric cancer. Moreover, nAChR plays an important role in cigarette smoke-related lung carcinogenesis as well as gastric cancer. Nevertheless, no study has evaluated the association between CHRNA5-A3-B4 gene cluster variants (rs667282 and rs3743073, two variants modifying lung cancer risk) and risk of gastric cancer. We genotyped these two single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) and analyzed their associations with risk of gastric cancer in a case-control study of 637 gastric cancer patients and 855 healthy individuals matched by age and sex in a Chinese Han population. The differences in genotype distribution of the two SNPs (rs667282, rs3743073) between the cases and controls were not statistically significant (p = 0.468 and p = 0.495, respectively). Overall, we did not observe a significant association of each genotype of the two SNPs with risk of gastric cancer (TT/CT vs. CC: adjusted OR = 1.12,95 % CI = 0.86-1.45; p = 0.401 for rs667282 and GG/TG vs. TT: adjusted OR = 1.13,95 % CI = 0.90-1.43; p = 0.300 for rs3743073).The results of our study indicated that these two SNPs at the 15q25 locus did not modify gastric cancer risk and the reported risk SNP at 15q25 may be specific to lung cancer.

The glutamate transporter gene solute carrier family 1, member 1 was previously tested as a promising candidate for OCD by several research groups. However, subsequent studies were not consistent. OCD is a heterogeneous disease. Early-onset OCD is a demographically and clinically distinct subtype of OCD and may be a more homogeneous subtype. Gender-matched 244 early-onset OCD patients, 244 late-onset OCD patients, and 244 healthy controls were genotyped with four SNPs (rs10491734, rs2228622, rs301430, and rs301443) through TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. There were statistical differences in allele and genotype frequencies of rs10491734 in early-onset OCD patients compared to late-onset OCD or control subjects. The haplotype analysis showed that the four-locus haplotype (A-A-C-C and A-G-C-C) were associated with early onset obsessive-compulsive disorder after Bonferroni correction.

23577780,23577780,Associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms and epidural ropivacaine consumption in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery.,"Up to date, few published studies indicated the associations between genetic polymorphisms and epidural local anesthetics consumption. In this study, we investigated the associations between seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and epidural ropivacaine consumption during breast cancer surgery in women from northeastern China. These seven SNPs (rs3803662 and rs12443621 in TNCR9, rs889312 in MAP3K1, rs3817198 in LSP1, rs13387042 at 2q35, rs13281615 at 8q24, and rs2046210 at 6q25.1) were identified by recent genome-wide association studies associated with tumor susceptibility. A total of 418 breast cancer women received thoracic epidural anesthesia with ropivacaine for elective mastectomy with axillary clearance. Their blood samples were genotyped for the seven SNPs using the SNaPshot method. For SNP rs13281615, the subjects with genotype AG and GG consumed a greater amount of the total epidural ropivacaine and the mean ropivacaine dose than the subjects with genotype AA (p=0.047 and p=0.003, respectively). Furthermore, no statistical differences were found in the total dose of ropivacaine, the mean consumption of ropivacaine, the onset of ropivacaine, or the initial dose of lidocaine among the three genotypic groups for the other six SNPs studied. Our study indicated that SNP rs13281615 at 8q24 was associated with the consumption of epidural ropivacaine during breast cancer surgery in northeastern Chinese women.

Selected germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the pathways have been associated with esophageal cancer and gastric cancer (GC) but few studies have comprehensively examined the pathway genes. We aimed to investigate associations between DNA repair pathway genes and risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and GC, using data from a genome-wide association study in a Han Chinese population where ESCC and GC are the predominant cancers. In sum, 1942 ESCC cases, 1758 GC cases and 2111 controls from the Shanxi Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer Genetics Project (discovery set) and the Linxian Nutrition Intervention Trials (replication set) were genotyped for 1675 SNPs in 170 DNA repair-related genes. Logistic regression models were applied to evaluate SNP-level associations. Gene- and pathway-level associations were determined using the resampling-based adaptive rank-truncated product approach. The DNA repair pathways overall were significantly associated with risk of ESCC (P = 6.37 × 10(-4)), but not with GC (P = 0.20). The most significant gene in ESCC was CHEK2 (P = 2.00 × 10(-6)) and in GC was CLK2 (P = 3.02 × 10(-4)).

23499746,23499746,SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 are associated with treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia with the combination of 5α-reductase inhibitors and α-adrenergic receptor antagonists.,"Common treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia include 5α-reductase inhibitors and α-adrenergic receptor antagonists. However, these treatments can only partially decrease the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia progression. SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 are 5α-reductase inhibitor targets. We investigated the association between drug efficacy and single nucleotide polymorphisms in the SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 genes in a Chinese population."
23490065,23490065,A population-based association study of 2q32.3 and 8q21.3 loci with schizophrenia in Han Chinese.,"It has been reported that two new schizophrenia susceptibility loci (2q32.3 and 8q21.3) containing two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs17662626 and rs7004633) have been identified in Europeans by a genome-wide association study. To determine if the two regions are associated with schizophrenia in Han Chinese, which are distinct from Europeans, we analyzed 9 SNPs, including rs17662626 and rs7004633, within 2 regions involving 1430 cases and 1570 controls from the Han population. Single SNP association, haplotype association, and gender-specific association analyses were performed. Single SNP analyses revealed that there was no association with schizophrenia in the region of 2q32.3, but rs7004633 mapping to the region of 8q21.3 was significantly associated with schizophrenia (p = 5.1 × 10(-5); OR = 1.274; 95% CI, 1.134-1.429). Further genotype and haplotype association analyses for the region of 8q21.3 suggested a similar pattern. Additionally, analyses by haplotypes indicated that a haplotype block in the region of 8q21.3 highly associated with schizophrenia and one haplotype in this haploblock had a 1.5-fold increase in the cases. Our results provide further evidence regarding the association of the region of 8q21.3 with schizophrenia in Han Chinese, as well as Europeans, which confirmed the previous report that 8q21.3 may play important roles in the etiology of schizophrenia."

23500594,23500594,Identification and genetic effect of haplotype in the bovine BMP7 gene.,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are peptide growth factors belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily, and some members of the BMP family support white adipocyte differentiation. In this study, we focused on the BMP7 which singularly promotes the differentiation of brown preadipocytes. Haplotypes involving 5 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites in the bovine BMP7 gene were identified and their effect on body weight was analyzed. 16 haplotypes and 18 combined haplotypes were revealed and the linkage disequilibrium was assessed in the cattle population with 602 individuals representing three main cattle breeds from China. The results showed that haplotypes 3, 10 and 14 were predominant and accounted for 75.64%, 69.85%, and 83.36% in Nanyang, Qinchuan and Jiaxian cattle breeds, respectively. The statistical analyses indicated that the SNP 1, 4, and 5 are associated with the body weight, body length, and heart girth at 12 and 24 months in Nanyang cattle population (P<0.05), whereas there is no significant association between their 16 haplotypes and 18 combined haplotypes. Our results provide evidence that some SNPs and haplotypes in BMP7 are associated with growth traits, and may be utilized as a genetic marker in marker-assisted selection for beef cattle breeding programs."
23488625,23488625,Association analysis between MDR1 gene polymorphisms and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in Chinese population.,The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between MDR1 gene polymorphisms and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk. Genomic DNA of 1431 subjects was extracted from peripheral blood and genotyping was performed using the created restriction site-polymerase chain reaction (CRS-PCR). We found that the c.1465C > T single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) increased HCC risk in all genetic models (p < 0.05) and the allele-T of c.1465C > T may contribute to the risk of HCC. No significantly increased HCC risk was detected in c.159G > T SNP. Our data indicated that the genetic variants of MDR1 gene may be a valuable molecular marker for HCC.
23477970,23477970,Impact of interaction of cigarette smoking with angiotensin-converting enzyme polymorphisms on end-stage renal disease risk in a Han Chinese population.,Several polymorphisms in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 genes are associated with the development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Certain genetic polymorphisms may modify the deleterious effects of environmental factors such as cigarette smoking and may also modify the inherited risk. We investigated the association of six ACE and ACE2 polymorphisms with ESRD to determine whether a relationship exists between gene-smoking interactions and ESRD.
23505139,23505139,An analysis of the association between the vitamin D pathway and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in a healthy Chinese population.,"Vitamin D deficiency has been recognized as a major public health issue worldwide. Recent studies have indicated that genetic factors might play an important role in determining serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels in Caucasians and African Americans. However, the genes that contribute to the variation in serum 25(OH)D levels in Chinese are unknown. In this study, we screened 15 key genes within the vitamin D metabolic pathway using 96 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in a group of 2897 unrelated healthy Chinese subjects. Significant confounding factors that may influence the variability in serum 25(OH)D levels were used as covariates for association analyses. An association test for quantitative traits was performed to evaluate the association between candidate genes and serum 25(OH)D levels. In the present study, variants and/or haplotypes in GC, CYP2R1, and DHCR7/NADSYN1 were identified as being associated with 25(OH)D levels. Participants with three or four risk alleles of the two variants (GC-rs4588 and CYP2R1-rs10766197) had an increased chance of presenting with a 25(OH)D concentration lower than 20 ng/mL (odds ratio 2.121, 95% confidence interval 1.586-2.836, p = 6.1 × 10(-8) ) compared with those lacking the risk alleles. Each additional copy of a risk allele was significantly associated with a 0.12-fold decrease in the log-25(OH)D concentration (p = 3.7 × 10(-12) ). Haplotype TGA of GC rs705117-rs2282679-rs1491710, haplotype GAGTAC of GC rs842999-rs705120-rs222040-rs4588-rs7041-rs10488854, haplotype CA of GC rs1155563-rs222029, and haplotype AAGA of CYP2R1 rs7936142-rs12794714-rs2060793-rs16930609 were genetic risk factors toward a lower 25(OH)D concentration. In contrast, haplotype TGGGCCC of DHCR7/NADSYN1 rs1790349-rs7122671-rs1790329-rs11606033-rs2276360-rs1629220-rs2282618 were genetic protective factors. The results suggest that the GC, CYP2R1, and DHCR7/NADSYN1 genes might contribute to variability in the serum 25(OH)D levels in a healthy Chinese population in Shanghai. These markers could be used as tools in Mendelian randomization analyses of vitamin D, and they could potentially be drug targets in the Chinese population in Shanghai."
23473757,23473757,BRIP1 variations analysis reveals their relative importance as genetic susceptibility factor for cervical cancer.,"To evaluate the association between gene variations in BRIP1 (BRCA1-interacting protein 1) and the risk of cervical cancer, we examined eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs: rs2048718, rs12937080, rs4988344, rs6504074, rs4988345, rs4986764, rs4986763, and rs11079454) in the BRIP1 gene in cervical tissue from a Chinese population using the MassARRAY system. The participants enrolled included 454 cervical cancer patients and 562 healthy controls. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to examine the potential correlation between functional BRIP1 SNP genotypes and mRNA levels in cervical cancer tissues. Our results first showed that rs4986764, located in exon 18 in the BRIP1 gene, was significantly associated with cervical cancer (χ(2)=11.191, P=0.001, odds ratio (OR)=1.384, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.144-1.675). Another significant association was observed for rs4986763 located in exon 20 in BRIP1 (χ(2)=4.988, P=0.026, OR=1.241, 95% CI=1.027-1.500). Strong linkage disequilibrium was observed in the rs11079454-rs4986763-rs4986764 SNP block (D'>0.9). The frequencies of haplotype T-T-T are higher in controls than in these patients (P=2.01E-5). Moreover, cervical cancer tissues with a homozygous C/C genotype for rs4986764 had the lowest level of BRIP1, which was 2.8 and 2.9-fold lower than the C/T heterozygote and the T/T homozygote, respectively. These findings indicate a role for BRIP1 gene variations in cervical cancer and may be informative for future genetic or biological studies on cervical cancer."

Evidence suggests that polymorphisms in the gene coding for mitochondrial ribosomal protein L4 (MRPL4), located in close proximity to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) gene on chromosome location 19p13.2, may influence the risk factor for the development of AR."
23467202,23467202,Common polymorphism rs11191548 near the CYP17A1 gene is associated with hypertension and systolic blood pressure in the Han Chinese population.,"Background The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11191548, near the CYP17A1 gene, has been identified as being associated with hypertension and systolic blood pressure (SBP) in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in a European population. The CYP17A1 gene encodes cytochrome P450c17alpha and plays an important role in the steroidogenic pathway, which includes mineralocorticoids. Methods We investigated the SNP rs11191548 in a case-control study of 1,102 subjects with essential hypertension (EH) and 1,109 normotensive controls. Results The SNP rs11191548 was significantly associated with hypertension in an additive genetic model (genotypes CC vs. TC vs. TT; odds ratio (OR) = 1.27 (95% CI, 1.10-1.47; P = 0.001)). The ORs of the TC vs. TT and CC vs. TT genotypes were 1.34 (95% CI, 1.10-1.63; P = 0.003) and 1.52 (95% CI, 1.10-2.12; P = 0.014), respectively. The risk C-allele was associated with increased SBP (βadj ± SEM = 1.307±0.515; P = 0.011) levels in the controls and decreased plasma renin activity (PRA) (βadj ± SEM = -0.053±0.016; P = 0.001) in the subjects with EH. In a stratified analysis of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS)-related antagonists, the C-allele was significantly associated with decreased serum potassium (K(+)) (βadj ± SEM = -0.093±0.028; P = 0.001) and PRA (βadj ± SEM = -0.067±0.023; P = 0.003) levels in patients with EH who were not taking RAAS-related antagonists. These results remained statistically significant after correction for multiple corrections. Conclusions The SNP rs11191548, near the CYP17A1 gene, was associated with hypertension and SBP in a Chinese Han population. The rs11191548 polymorphism was also related to lower PRA and K(+) levels, suggesting that it has an effect on the enzymatic activity of CYP17A1."
23462334,23462334,Association between rs10118757(A/G) in methylthioadenosine phosphorylase gene and coronary artery disease in Chinese Hans.,"Studies focusing on the association of gene methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) with the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) are limited. In this study, we explored the effects of rs10118757 in MTAP gene on CAD and MI by performing association analysis in a Chinese Han population. rs10118757 was genotyped in 1007 CAD patients (including 338 MI patients) and 885 healthy controls. Allelic analysis showed that allele A of rs10118757 was associated with increased risk of CAD, with OR (95%CI)=1.193 (1.035-1.376), and P=0.015. After adjusted for age, BMI, gender, hypertension and smoking, rs10118757 was still significantly associated with CAD under additive and dominant models, with OR (95%CI)=1.252 (1.070-1.465), P=0.005, and OR (95%CI)=1.698 (1.168-2.467), P=0.006, respectively. Compared to additive model, dominant model may be the best-fitting model (P=6.63E-10 vs P=6.70E-10). As reported previously, rs10118757 was not associated with MI in the current study. Our study firstly reported that SNP rs10118757 was associated with CAD risk in a Chinese Han population, indicating that MTAP gene may play a potential role in the pathophysiological process of CAD."
23467743,23467743,Replication study and meta-analysis of human nonobstructive azoospermia in Japanese populations.,"Recently, a Chinese genomewide association study (GWAS) identified four autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci as being significantly associated with risk factors for nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA; P < 5 × 10(-8)). In the present study, we performed a replication study on two Japanese cohorts from different institutions in order to evaluate whether SNP loci are associated with NOA. The four SNPs (rs12097821, rs2477686, rs10842262, and rs6080550) reported in the Chinese GWAS were genotyped in 490 NOA patients and 1167 controls. To assess the significance of the associations between each of the four SNPs and NOA in the Japanese population, the association results for the two cohorts were combined by meta-analysis. In the meta-analysis, the combined per-allele odds ratios (ORs) for the four SNPs and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were as follows: rs12097821, OR = 1.10 (CI = 0.89-1.37); rs2477686, OR = 1.11 (CI = 0.87-1.43); rs10842262, OR = 1.11 (CI = 0.94-1.32); and rs6080550, OR = 0.96 (CI = 0.76-1.21). None of the SNPs was significantly associated with NOA (P > 0.05). However, three of four SNPs (rs12097821, rs2477686, and rs10842262) showed associations in the same direction in Japanese men as those reported in the Chinese GWAS. To determine whether the four SNPs are genetic risk factors for NOA, the effect sizes of NOA risk factors require further investigation using larger independent sets of case-control samples of populations, including Japanese and Chinese populations."
23456169,23456169,Association of polymorphisms in the Chr18q11.2 locus with tuberculosis in Chinese population.,"A GWAS study has reported that two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with predisposition to tuberculosis (TB) in African populations. These two loci represented the long-waited GWAS hits for TB susceptibility. To determine whether these two SNPs are associated with TB in Chinese population, we attempted an replication in a cohort of over one thousand Chinese TB patients and 1,280 healthy controls using melting temperature shift allele-specific genotyping analysis. We found that only SNP rs4331426 was significantly associated with TB in Chinese population (p = 0.011). However, the effect was opposite. The G allele of the SNP in Chinese population is a protective allele (OR = 0.62, 95 % CI 0.44-0.87), while it was the risk allele for African population (OR = 1.19, 95 % CI 1.12-1.26). No significance was found for SNP rs2335704. The results provided an independent support for a role in susceptibility to TB for SNP rs4331426. However, it also indicated that direct predisposition element to TB and the association effects may vary across ethnic groups."
23456091,23456091,Combined analysis of genome-wide-linked susceptibility loci to Kawasaki disease in Han Chinese.,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is a dominant cause of acquired heart disease in children due to frequent complicating coronary artery lesions (CALs). Genome-wide association study and linkage analysis have recently identified 6 susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance of P < 5.0 × 10(-8) in subjects of Japanese, Taiwanese and European. In present study, we analysed the variants of 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genetic loci to investigate their potential effect on KD susceptibility and outcomes in Han Chinese population. As a result, the risk alleles of rs1801274 and rs2254546 were observed significant effect on KD with higher frequencies in 358 patients than those in 815 controls. The significant role of rs1801274, rs2857151 and rs2254546 in KD was found in the multi-variable logistic regression analysis of the SNPs. Two 2-locus and one 3-locus combinations of the SNPs showed significant effect on KD with stronger association with KD relative to comparable single SNP or 2-locus combinations. Significant susceptibility to CALs was found in KD patients with high-risk genotypes at both rs1801274 and rs2857151. The meta-analyses first revealed significant risk for CALs in KD patients carrying risk allele of rs11340705, and the association of rs28493229 with KD was not observed in the Han Chinese. In conclusion, the findings demonstrated that 5 of the 6 genetic loci influence the risk for KD and 3 of them may be involved in secondary CALs formation in Han Chinese. The additive effects of 3 multi-locus combinations on KD/CALs imply that some loci may participate together in certain unknown gene networks related to KD/CALs. Further function studies of the genetic loci are helpful for better understanding the pathophysiology of KD."

23456610,23456610,SOX10 rs139883 polymorphism is associated with the age of onset in schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a common psychiatric disorder with high heritability. The age of onset is an important phenotype of schizophrenia and may be under considerable genetic control. Our previous study showed that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs139887 in sex-determining region Y-box 10 (SOX10) gene was associated with the age of onset in schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of another SNP rs139883 in the exon 4 of SOX10 on schizophrenia using an early-onset samples in the Han Chinese population. A total of 309 schizophrenic patients with onset before age 18 and 390 healthy controls were recruited for association study. No significant differences of allele or genotype frequencies were identified between the schizophrenic patients and controls. However, the C allele was significantly associated with an earlier age of onset in total patients and male patients (Kaplan-Meier log rank test P = 0.026; Kaplan-Meier log rank test P = 0.047, respectively), but not in females. In conclusion, the SOX10 rs139883 polymorphism influenced the age of onset of schizophrenia in a gender-specific manner and this may represent a vital genetic clue for the etiology of schizophrenia."
23437296,23437296,The association between two common polymorphisms in MicroRNAs and hepatocellular carcinoma risk in Asian population.,"Emerging evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) participate in human carcinogenesis as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the miRNAs may influence the function of mature miRNAs and then affect the processing of carcinogenesis. It has been suggested that two common SNPs rs2910164 in miR-146a and rs3746444 in miR-499 are associated with susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, published results are inconsistent and inconclusive. To acquire a more precise effect of the association between these polymorphisms and HCC risk, we performed this meta-analysis."

23431394,23431394,Rs4074134 near BDNF gene is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Chinese Han population independently of body mass index.,"Obesity and family history are the most important predictors for type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) in the Chinese Han population. However, it is not known whether the genetic loci related to obesity are associated with the risk of developing T2DM in this population. The present case-control study evaluated the associations between five genetic loci for obesity and the pathogenesis of T2DM. The study included 1117 Chinese Han patients with T2DM, 1629 patients with pre-diabetes (impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance, IFG/IGT) and 1113 control subjects residing in Beijing. Five genetic loci including rs2815752 near NEGR1, rs10938397 near GNPDA2, rs4074134 near BDNF, rs17782313 near MC4R and rs1084753 near KCTD15 were genotyped. The results showed an association between rs4074134-BDNF minor allele and T2DM irrespective of age, gender and body mass index (BMI) (OR = 0.87; 95%CI: 0.77-0.99, P = 0.04). This SNP was also associated with pre-diabetes (OR = 0.87; 95%CI: 0.77-0.97, P = 0.01) independently of age, gender and BMI. No associations were found between diabetes or pre-diabetes and any of the other SNP loci studied. Genotype-phenotype association analysis (adjusting for age and gender) showed rs4074134-BDNF to be associated with BMI, waist circumference, fasting and postprandial plasma glucose, fasting serum insulin, and HOMA-IR in subjects without T2DM. However, fasting and postprandial plasma glucose were the only significant factors after adjusting for BMI. These results suggest that the common variation of BDNF (rs4074134) is associated with T2DM independently of obesity in Chinese Han population. This variant also has an effect on plasma glucose concentration, BMI and insulin sensitivity."

23431371,23431371,An exploratory study of the association between KCNB1 rs1051295 and type 2 diabetes and its related traits in Chinese Han population.,"Since the KCNB1 encoding Kv2.1 channel accounts for the majority of Kv currents modulating insulin secretion by pancreatic islet beta-cells, we postulated that KCNB1 is a plausible candidate gene for genetic variation contributing to the variable compensatory secretory function of beta-cells in type-2 diabetes (T2D). We conducted two studies, a case-control study and a cross-section study, to investigate the association of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in KCNB1 with T2D and its linking traits. In the case-control study, we first examined the association of 20 tag SNPs of KCNB1 with T2D in a population with 226 T2D patients and non-diabetic subjects (screening study). We then identified the association in an enlarged population of 412 T2D patients and non-diabetic subjects (replication study). In the cross-sectional study, we investigated the linkage between the candidate SNP rs1051295 and T2D by comparing beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity among rs1051295 genotypes in a general population of 1051 subjects at fasting and after glucose loading (oral glucose tolerance tests, OGTT) in 84 fasting glucose impaired subjects, and several T2D-related traits. We found that among the 19 available tag SNPs, only the KCNB1 rs1051295 was associated with T2D (P = 0.027), with the rs1051295 TT genotype associated with an increased risk of T2D compared with genotypes CC (P = 0.009). At fasting, rs1051295 genotype TT was associated with a 9.8% reduction in insulin sensitivity compared to CC (P = 0.008); along with increased plasma triglycerides (TG) levels (TT/CC: P = 0.046) and increased waist/hip (W/H) ratio (TT/CC: P = 0.013; TT/TC: P = 0.002). OGTT confirmed that genotype TT exhibited reduced insulin sensitivity by 16.3% (P = 0.030) compared with genotype TC+CC in a fasting glucose impaired population. The KCNB1 rs1051295 genotype TT in the Chinese Han population is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity and increased plasma TG and W/H ratio, which together contribute to an increased risk for T2D."

23409110,23409110,"Genetic diversity, linkage disequilibrium and selection signatures in chinese and Western pigs revealed by genome-wide SNP markers.","To investigate population structure, linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern and selection signature at the genome level in Chinese and Western pigs, we genotyped 304 unrelated animals from 18 diverse populations using porcine 60 K SNP chips. We confirmed the divergent evolution between Chinese and Western pigs and showed distinct topological structures of the tested populations. We acquired the evidence for the introgression of Western pigs into two Chinese pig breeds. Analysis of runs of homozygosity revealed that historical inbreeding reduced genetic variability in several Chinese breeds. We found that intrapopulation LD extents are roughly comparable between Chinese and Western pigs. However, interpopulation LD is much longer in Western pigs compared with Chinese pigs with average r(2) (0.3) values of 125 kb for Western pigs and only 10.5 kb for Chinese pigs. The finding indicates that higher-density markers are required to capture LD with causal variants in genome-wide association studies and genomic selection on Chinese pigs. Further, we looked across the genome to identify candidate loci under selection using F(ST) outlier tests on two contrast samples: Tibetan pigs versus lowland pigs and belted pigs against non-belted pigs. Interestingly, we highlighted several genes including ADAMTS12, SIM1 and NOS1 that show signatures of natural selection in Tibetan pigs and are likely important for genetic adaptation to high altitude. Comparison of our findings with previous reports indicates that the underlying genetic basis for high-altitude adaptation in Tibetan pigs, Tibetan peoples and yaks is likely distinct from one another. Moreover, we identified the strongest signal of directional selection at the EDNRB loci in Chinese belted pigs, supporting EDNRB as a promising candidate gene for the white belt coat color in Chinese pigs. Altogether, our findings advance the understanding of the genome biology of Chinese and Western pigs."

23433405,23433405,A single-nucleotide polymorphism of miR-196a-2 and vitiligo: an association study and functional analysis in a Han Chinese population.,"Recent evidence indicates that oxidative stress and genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. SNPs in miRNAs involved in oxidative stress could potentially influence the development of vitiligo. In this case-control study, we investigated the association of a functional SNP of rs11614913 in miR-196a-2 with risk of vitiligo. A significantly lower risk of vitiligo was associated with the rs11614913 miR-196a-2 CC genotype (adjusted OR, 0.77; CI, 0.60-0.98). In addition, TYRP1 gene expression was considerably down-regulated by the rs11614913 C allele in miR-196a-2, which lowered the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced the proportion of early apoptosis in human melanocytes in response to H2 O2 treatment. Our data suggest that the rs11614913 C allele in miR-196a-2 confers potential protection against oxidative effects on human melanocytes through the modulation of the target gene, TYRP1, which may account for the decreased risk of vitiligo in this study population."
23411593,23411593,A common deletion in the APOBEC3 genes and breast cancer risk.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified multiple genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer. However, these loci explain only a small fraction of the heritability. Very few studies have evaluated copy number variation (CNV), another important source of human genetic variation, in relation to breast cancer risk."
23430406,23430406,Four common polymorphisms in microRNAs and the risk of adult glioma in a Chinese case-control study.,"Emerging evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) participate in human carcinogenesis as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. It has been suggested that four common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; miR-146aG > C, 149C > T, 196a2C > T, and 499A > G) are associated with susceptibility to numerous malignancies. However, published results are inconsistent and inclusive. To further investigate the role of these loci, we examined the association of the miRNA polymorphisms with the risk of gliomas in a Han population in northeastern China. Both miR-146aG > C and 196a2C > T showed allelic differences between glioma patients and healthy controls in the studied population, with an OR of 1.30 (P = 0.0006) and an odds ratio (OR) of 1.25 (P = 0.003), respectively. Logistic regression analysis also revealed that the 146aG > C and 196a2C > T wild-type homozygous carriers had an increased glioma risk compared to the variant carriers. Besides, in pairwise comparisons two SNP combinations were associated with the risk of glioma. Among others, carriers of both homozygous risk genotypes, i.e., 146aGG and 196a2CC were associated with a nearly 4-fold increased risk of glioma (OR = 3.77, P = 1.3 × 10(-4)). Overall, glioma risk increased with increasing numbers of risk variant alleles. These results suggest that the miR-146aG > C and 196a2C > T might influence the risk of developing glioma in a northeastern Han Chinese population."
23544998,23544998,Association of TRPC1 gene polymorphisms with type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy in Han Chinese population.,"The recent genome-wide association studies reveal that chromosome 3q resides within the linkage region for diabetic nephropathy (DN) in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1D and T2D). The TRPC1 gene is on chromosome 3q22-24, and it has been demonstrated that TRPC1 expression is reduced in the kidney of diabetic animal models. Genetic association of TRPC1 polymorphism with T1D and DN has been reported in European Americans. However, there are no studies reporting the association of TRPC1 genetic polymorphism with T2D with and without DN in Chinese population. This study aimed to demonstrate the genetic role of TRPC1 in the development of T2D with and without DN in Chinese Han population. A genetic association study of TRPC1 was performed in T2D cases and in nondiabetic controls from Han population located in Northern Chinese areas. Six tag single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers derived from HapMap data were genotyped. Among the six SNPs, only rs7638459 was suspected as risk factor of T2D without DN, fitting the log-additive model. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the CC genotyping was 2.39 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.00-5.68), compared with the TT genotyping. In addition, rs953239 was found to be a protective factor of getting DN in T2D, also fitting the log-additive model. When compared with the AA genotyping for SNP rs953239, the adjusted OR for CC genotyping was 0.63 (95% CI = 0.44-0.99). To summarize, this study shows that TRPC1 genetic polymorphisms are associated with T2D and DN in T2D in the Han Chinese population."
23408151,23408151,One novel susceptibility locus associate with systemic lupus erythematosus in Chinese Han population.,"The aim of the study is to explore additional susceptibility factors for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Chinese Hans. Based on our previous GWAS of SLE, we performed a multistage replication study involving 3,152 cases and 7,050 controls from China to identify additional susceptibility loci for SLE by using the Sequenom MassArray system. All Chinese Han samples used in this study were obtained from doctors through collaboration with multiple hospitals in two geographic regions (central and southern China). Single-marker association analyses were performed using logistic regression with gender as a covariate in each case-control cohort. The joint analysis of all combined samples was performed using logistic regression with gender and sample cohorts as covariates. The significant association evidence for rs906868 (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.08-1.20, P combined = 7.71 × 10(-10)) and rs7579944 (OR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.07-1.19, P combined = 5.55 × 10(-9)) was observed, which located at 2p23.1. In this region, limb bud and heart development homolog (LBH) was the only gene indicated, suggesting LBH might be a susceptibility gene for SLE, although its function was still unknown. The results indicated that the SNP rs7579944, rs906868 at 2p23.1 showed significant association with SLE. The genes LBH which located in this loci might be the predisposing genes of SLE."
23392799,23392799,Lack of association between genetic polymorphisms in cytokine genes and tumor recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing transplantation.,"Recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation (LT) remains one of the most common causes of poor long-term survival. However, the host genetic factors affecting increased risk of tumor recurrence after transplantation have not been thoroughly elucidated. The present study was designed to investigate the association of cytokine gene polymorphisms with the risk of tumor recurrence in LT patients for HCC."
23406873,23406873,A genome-wide meta-analysis identifies two novel loci associated with high myopia in the Han Chinese population.,"High myopia, highly prevalent in the Chinese population, is a leading cause of visual impairment worldwide. Genetic factors play a critical role in the development of this visual disorder. Genome-wide association studies in recent years have revealed several chromosomal regions that contribute to its progression. To identify additional genetic variants for high myopia susceptibility, we used a genome-wide meta-analysis to examine the associations between the disease and 286 031 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a combined cohort of 665 cases and 960 controls. The most significant SNPs (n = 61) were genotyped in a replication cohort (850 cases and 1197 controls), and 14 SNPs were further tested through genotyping in two additional validation cohorts (combined 1278 cases and 2486 controls). As a result of this analysis, four SNPs reached genome-wide significance (P < 2.0 × 10(-7)). The most significantly associated SNP, rs2730260 [overall P = 8.95 × 10(-14); odds ratio (95% CI) =1.33 (1.23-1.44)], is located in the VIPR2 gene, which is located in the MYP4 locus. The other three SNPs (rs7839488, rs4395927 and rs4455882) in the same linkage disequilibrium block are located in the SNTB1 gene, with -P values ranging from 1.13 × 10(-8) to 2.13 × 10(-11). The VIPR2 and SNTB1 genes are expressed in the retina and the retinal pigment epithelium and have been previously reported to have potential functions for the pathogenesis of myopia. Our results suggest that variants of the VIPR2 and SNTB1 genes increase susceptibility to high myopia in Han Chinese."
25206686,25206686,Is type I alpha 2 collagen gene responsible for intracranial aneurysm in Northeast China?,"In this study, we investigated whether a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs42524 G > C) in the type I alpha 2 collagen gene was associated with sporadic ruptured intracranial aneurysm or its clinical characteristics in patients from Northeast China. Genotyping of the rs42524 G > C polymorphism was carried out using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. The data showed that the frequency of the rs42524 GC + CC genotype was significantly higher than the GG genotype among intracranial aneurysm patients whose Hunt and Hess grading scale was > 3. In addition, the rs42524 G > C genotype was found to have a statistically significant association with intracranial aneurysm risk. These findings indicate that the type I alpha 2 collagen gene gene may be involved in a predisposition to intracranial aneurysm in the Northeast Chinese population. Crucially, the rs42524 C allele may be an important risk factor for increased severity of the condition in patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms."

The rs10947803 SNP in KCNK17 is significantly associated with ischemic stroke in Caucasian populations. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association with strokes in the Chinese population. A total of 1364 stroke patients and 1293 controls were examined using a case-control methodology. The rs10947803 SNP in KCNK17 was genotyped by a TaqMan real-time PCR assay. The rs10947803 SNP (A allele) of KCNK17 was significantly associated with cerebral hemorrhage (for AA+AC versus CC, unadjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-2.69; P=0.020). After adjustment for age and sex, the association remained significant for AA+AC versus CC, OR=1.65; 95% CI, 1.04-2.62; P=0.033. In addition, the rs10947803 SNP in KCNK17 was not associated with ischemic stroke (for AA+AC versus CC, unadjusted OR=0.92; 95% CI, 0.81-1.05; P=0.212, after age- and sex-adjustment, OR=0.87; 95% CI, 0.72-1.05; P=0.143). The rs10947803 SNP (A allele) in KCNK17 increases the risk of cerebral hemorrhage but not ischemic stroke in the Chinese population."

23404648,23404648,An association study between genetic polymorphisms related to lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) and coronary heart disease.,"Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-PLA(2)) activity or levels in American and European individuals. A total of 290 coronary heart disease (CHD) patients, 198 non-CHD patients and 331 unrelated healthy volunteers were recruited for the present case-control study of Han Chinese. Four SNPs (rs964184 of ZNF259, rs7528419 of CELSR2 and rs7756935 and rs1805017 of PLA2G7) were shown to be significantly associated with CHD. The rs964184-G allele of the ZNF259 gene was identified as a risk factor of CHD in females (odds ratio (OR) =1.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) =1.00-2.22, P=0.05). The rs7528419-G allele of the CELSR2 gene was protective against CHD in males (OR=0.48, 95% CI=0.25-0.93, P=0.04). The other two alleles (rs7756935-C and rs1805017-A) of the PLA2G7 gene acted as protective factors against CHD in females (rs7756935-C: OR=0.59, 95% CI=0.35-1.00, P=0.05; rs1805017-A: OR=0.51, 95% CI=0.28-0.93, P=0.03). Moreover, rs1805017 of the PLA2G7 gene was associated with the severity of CHD only in females (r(2)=0.02, P=0.04). We identified four Lp-PLA(2)-associated SNPs significantly associated with CHD in a Han Chinese population. Specifically, rs7528419 was protective factor against CHD in males, while the other two SNPs (rs7756935 and rs1805017 of the PLA2G7 gene) were protective factors against CHD in females and rs964184 of the ZNF259 gene was regarded as a risk factor for CHD in females."
23385236,23385236,Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes and susceptibility to glioma in a chinese population.,"The excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency complementation group 1 (ERCC1), and X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) genes appear to protect mammalian cells from the harmful effects of ionizing radiation. We conducted a large case-control study to investigate the association of polymorphisms in ERCC1 C118T, ERCC1 C8092A, XRCC1 A194T, XRCC1 A194T, and XRCC3 C241T, with glioma risk in a Chinese population. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped, using the MassARRAY IPLEX platform, in 443 glioma cases and 443 controls. Association analyses based on an χ2 test and binary logistic regression were performed to determine the odds ratio (OR) and a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each SNP. For XRCC1 Arg194Trp, the variant genotype T/T was strongly associated with a lower risk of glioma cancer when compared with the wild type C/C  (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.43-4.45). Individuals carrying the XRCC1 399A allele had an increased risk of glioma (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.02-1.64). The XRCC3 241T/T genotype was associated with a strong increased glioma risk (OR = 3.78, 95% CI = 1.86-9.06). Further analysis of the interactions of two susceptibility-associated SNPs, XRCC1 Arg194Trp and XRCC3 Thr241Met, showed that the combination of the XRCC1 194T and XRCC3 241T alleles brought a large increase in glioma risk (OR = 2.75, 95% CI = 1.54-4.04). XRCC1 Arg194Trp, XRCC1 Arg399Gln, and XRCC3 C241T, appear to be associated with susceptibility to glioma in a Chinese population."

In order to study the correlation between PD-1 gene polymorphism and aplastic anemia in a Chinese Han population, two SNPs, PD-1.1 G/A (rs36084323) and PD-1.6 G/A (rs10204525), were genotyped in 166 patients with aplastic anemia and 144 healthy controls by direct sequencing. All genotype distributions in both patients and controls were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Associations of genotypes and alleles with aplastic anemia were analyzed. The results suggested that the G allele of PD-1.1 was associated with an increased risk for aplastic anemia, while SNP of PD-1.6 was not associated with aplastic anemia in a Chinese Han population."

23382861,23382861,Poor reproducibility of allergic rhinitis SNP associations.,"Replication of reported associations is crucial to the investigation of complex disease. More than 100 SNPs have previously been reported as associated with allergic rhinitis (AR), but few of these have been replicated successfully. To investigate the general reproducibility of reported AR-associations in candidate gene studies, one Swedish (352 AR-cases, 709 controls) and one Singapore Chinese population (948 AR-cases, 580 controls) were analyzed using 49 AR-associated SNPs. The overall pattern of P-values indicated that very few of the investigated SNPs were associated with AR. Given published odds ratios (ORs) most SNPs showed high power to detect an association, but no correlations were found between the ORs of the two study populations or with published ORs. None of the association signals were in common to the two genome-wide association studies published in AR, indicating that the associations represent false positives or have much lower effect-sizes than reported."
23360093,23360093,Association study of STAT4 polymorphisms and type 1 diabetes in Northeastern Chinese Han population.,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an organ-specific, T-cell-mediated disease resulting from the selective destruction of pancreatic β cells. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) gene is one of the most interesting genes for the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including T1D. In this study, a case-control study was conducted in a Han population in northeastern China comparing the genotypes of T1D patients to healthy controls for the presence of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the STAT4 gene. The study population comprised of 410 T1D patients and 407 healthy individuals. Two SNPs (rs7574865 and rs3024866) of STAT4 were genotyped with Multiplex SNaPShot method. Data were analyzed with spss 13.0 to determine if a statistical association existed between these genotypes and T1D. One of the two SNPs (rs7574865) was strongly associated with T1D in Northeastern Chinese population compared to healthy controls (P < 0.05), whereas the other tested SNP (rs3024866) demonstrated no significant relationship. In conclusion, the STAT4 gene may play an important role in facilitating susceptibility to T1D in this Han Chinese population."
23371916,23371916,A genome-wide association study for serum bilirubin levels and gene-environment interaction in a Chinese population.,"Bilirubin is an effective antioxidant and is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci affecting serum total bilirubin levels. However, most of the studies were conducted in European populations and little attention has been devoted either to genetic variants associated with direct and indirect bilirubin levels or to the gene-environment interactions on bilirubin levels. In this study, a two-stage GWAS was performed to identify genetic variants associated with all types of bilirubin levels in 10,282 Han Chinese individuals. Gene-environment interactions were further examined. Briefly, two previously reported loci, UGT1A1 on 2q37 (rs6742078 and rs4148323, combined P = 1.44 × 10(-89) and P = 5.05 × 10(-69) , respectively) and SLCO1B3 on 12p12 (rs2417940, combined P = 6.93 × 10(-19) ) were successfully replicated. The two loci explained 9.2% and 0.9% of the total variations of total bilirubin levels, respectively. Ethnic genetic differences were observed between Chinese and European populations. More importantly, a significant interaction was found between rs2417940 in SLCO1B3 gene and smoking on total bilirubin levels (P = 1.99 × 10(-3) ). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2417940 had stronger effects on total bilirubin levels in nonsmokers than in smokers, suggesting that the effects of SLCO1B3 genotype on bilirubin levels were partly dependent on smoking status. Consistent associations and interactions were observed for serum direct and indirect bilirubin levels."

The aim of this study was to validate the associations of rs2197089 in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene with serum lipid concentrations and gene expression levels in the Chinese Han population and examine the potential interactions. A total of 9339 participants were recruited and genotyped for rs2197089. Gene expression levels of LPL in blood cells of 309 participants were evaluated by real-time PCR. We observed significant associations between rs2197089 and decreased triglycerides (TG) (P=0.0006), but not high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration (P=0.0881). However, weak evidence of interaction between cigarette smoking and rs2197089 was detected (P=0.0362). In smokers, significant association between rs2197089 and increased HDL-C concentration was found (P=0.0068). Participants with the minor allele A had higher expression levels of LPL (P=0.0243). The results of our study indicated that rs2197089 was significantly associated with TG but it was associated with HDL-C only in smokers. This SNP seemed to have influence on the expression level of LPL."

23369609,23369609,Genetic polymorphism in hOGG1 is associated with triple-negative breast cancer risk in Chinese Han women.,"8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanine (8-OHdG), a typical product of oxidative stress-induced DNA damage, can cause a G-T transversion during DNA replication if it is not removed. Human 8-oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (hOGG1), a key DNA repair gene, recognizes and excises 8-OHdG from damaged DNA accurately; however, a c.977C>G (Ser326Cys) polymorphism in hOGG1 can inhibit the gene's ability to remove 8-OHdG. The aim of present study was to investigate the association between the c.977C>G polymorphism in hOGG1 and the risk of breast cancer in Chinese Han women. We used high-resolution melting and sequencing to analyze the genotypes of 630 patients with sporadic breast cancer patients and 777 healthy controls. We also performed risk-stratified subgroup analyses to determine the association between the c.977C>G polymorphism and other characteristics of breast cancer subgroups. Breast cancer patients and healthy controls did not have significantly different of c.977C/G genotypes (odds ratio [OR] = 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.82-1.49, p = 0.57) and c.977G/G genotypes (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 0.97-1.84, p = 0.09). However, the c.977G/G genotype was especially prevalent in breast cancer patients who were younger than 55 years (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.05-2.39, p = 0.04), were premenopausal status (OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.14-3.06, p = 0.02), had triple-negative disease (OR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.06-4.29, p = 0.04), or p53-positive disease (OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.14-2.12, p = 0.005). These findings suggest that the c.977C>G polymorphism in hOGG1 is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in Chinese Han women who are younger than 55 years, premenopausal, triple-negative, or p53-positive subgroups."

23333377,23333377,Association study between genes in Reelin signaling pathway and autism identifies DAB1 as a susceptibility gene in a Chinese Han population.,"Autism is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosed in early childhood. The genetic factors might play an important role in its pathogenesis. Previous studies revealed that Reelin (RELN) polymorphisms were associated with autism. However, the roles of genes in Reelin signaling pathway for autism are largely unknown. As several knockout mice models in which the Reelin pathway genes (i.e. DAB1, VLDLR/APOER2, FYN/SRC and CRK/CRKL) are deficient have the similar phenotype as the reeler mice (Reelin(-/-)), we hypothesized that the Reelin signaling pathway genes might play roles in the etiology of autism. Therefore, we conducted a family-based association study. Sixty-two tagged single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering 15 genes in Reelin pathway were genotyped in 239 trios, and 14 significant SNPs were further investigated in the additional 188 trios. In the total 427 trios, we found significant genetic association between autism and four SNPs in DAB1 (rs12035887 G: p=0.0006; rs3738556 G: p=0.0044; rs1202773 A: p=0.0048; rs12740765 T: p=0.0196). After the Bonferroni correction, SNP rs12035887 remained significant. Furthermore, the haplotype constructed with rs1202773 and rs12023109 in DAB1 showed significant excess transmission in both individual and global haplotype analyses (p=0.0052 and 0.0279, respectively). Our findings suggested that variations in DAB1 involved in the Reelin signaling pathway might contribute to genetic susceptibility to autism with Chinese Han decent, supporting the defect in the Reelin signaling pathway as a predisposition factor for autism."
23324273,23324273,Association between genetic variants of the leukotriene biosynthesis pathway and the risk of stroke: a case-control study in the Chinese Han population.,"Leukotrienes are arachidonic acid derivatives long known for their inflammatory properties. Leukotriene-based inflammation has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in atherosclerosis, a major risk factor for several human diseases. Recently, human genetic studies from us and others suggest that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in leukotriene pathway genes influence the risk of atherosclerotic diseases such as stroke. This study aimed to assess the role of additional leukotriene pathway genes as a stroke risk factor within the Chinese Han population."
23363866,23363866,[Association between human beta defensin-1 single nucleotide polymorphisms and susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis].,To investigate the possible association between the SNP in the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of the human beta defensin 1 (DEFB1) gene and the susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in Chinese Han population.
23334603,23334603,Polymorphisms of the WRN gene and DNA damage of peripheral lymphocytes in age-related cataract in a Han Chinese population.,"Werner syndrome is caused by mutations in the DNA repair Werner helicase (WRN) gene and characterized by accelerated aging including cataracts. Age-related cataract (ARC) cases (N = 504) and controls (N = 244) were recruited from a population-based study to evaluate the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of WRN and another DNA repair gene (human 8-oxoguanine DNA N-glycosylase 1) with ARC. Among the five SNPs tested, only WRN rs1346044 was found to be significantly associated between cases and controls before multiple-testing adjustment. The minor C allele of rs1346044 was associated with ARC with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.66, suggesting a protective role of the C allele for developing ARC. The stratification analysis on the subtypes of ARC showed that rs1346044 was significantly associated with cortical cataract, but not with nuclear, posterior subcapsular, and mixed types after multiple-testing adjustment (OR = 0.51, p< 0.01). The genetic model analysis showed that the results fit the dominant model (OR = 0.44, p < 0.001). The comet assay used to assess the extent of DNA damage in peripheral lymphocytes of ARC cases found that the DNA damage in lymphocytes from patients with CC genotype was significantly less than that in patients with TT genotype. We concluded that the C allele of rs1346044, a non-synonymous SNP resulting in the conversion of Cys to Arg at amino acid position 1367 of WRN, alters susceptibility to ARC, especially the cortical type of the disease, in the Han Chinese. The underlying mechanism of its protective role might be related to the improved DNA repair function."

Recently, three genome-wide association studies discovered associations between the ZBTB38 and adult height in different populations. Therefore, variations in the ZBTB38 might contribute to ISS. Furthermore, one study in Korean population showed that ZBTB38 gene was significantly associated with adult height, but not with ISS. We want to examine whether the variants in ZBTB38 are associated with ISS in Chinese Han."
23300798,23300798,Fine mapping of a region of chromosome 11q23.3 reveals independent locus associated with risk of glioma.,"A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at locus 11q23.3 (rs498872) in the near 5'-UTR of the PHLDB1 gene was recently implicated as a risk factor for gliomas in a genome-wide association study, and this involvement was confirmed in three additional studies."
23333936,23333936,Genetic variation in transforming growth factor beta 1 and mammographic density in Singapore Chinese women.,"TGF-β plays a critical role in normal mammary development and morphogenesis. Decreased TGF-β signaling has been associated with increased mammographic density. Percent mammographic density (PMD) adjusted for age and body mass index (BMI) is a strong risk factor and predictor of breast cancer risk. PMD is highly heritable, but few genetic determinants have been identified. We investigated the association between genetic variation in TGFB1 and PMD using a cross-sectional study of 2,038 women who were members of the population-based Singapore Chinese Health Study cohort. We assessed PMD using a computer-assisted method. We used linear regression to examine the association between nine tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of TGFB1 and PMD and their interaction with parity, adjusting for age, BMI, and dialect group. We calculated P values adjusted for correlated tests (P(ACT)) to account for multiple testing. The strongest association was observed for rs2241716. Adjusted PMD was higher by 1.5% per minor allele (P(ACT) = 0.04). When stratifying by parity, this association was limited to nulliparous women. For nulliparous women, adjusted PMD was higher by 8.6% per minor allele (P(ACT) = 0.003; P for interaction with parity = 0.002). Three additional TGFB1 tagging SNPs, which were in linkage disequilibrium with rs2241716, were statistically significantly associated with adjusted PMD (P(ACT) < 0.05) for nulliparous women. However, none of these three SNPs showed statistically significant association after adjusting for rs2241716. Our data support that TGFB1 genetic variation may be an important genetic determinant of mammographic density measure that predicts breast cancer risk, particularly in nulliparous women."
23299803,23299803,FOXP3 genetic variant and risk of acute coronary syndrome in Chinese Han population.,"Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality all over the world. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is the most serious form of coronary artery disease. Recently, many studies indicated that genetic susceptibility may play a vital role in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease including ACS. Forkhead/winged helix transcription factor (FOXP3) gene polymorphisms have been previously found to be associated with inflammatory diseases. To determine whether FOXP3 polymorphisms are associated with ACS, we examined the single nucleotide polymorphism rs3761548 of FOXP3 gene by polymerase chain reaction-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 226 ACS patients and 259 unrelated healthy subjects. Our results showed that single nucleotide polymorphism rs3761548 had association with ACS in Chinese Han population. These data indicate that, for the first time, FOXP3 gene polymorphism may appear to play an important role in the susceptibility of ACS in Chinese Han population."
23292505,23292505,Association of a single-nucleotide polymorphism within the miR-146a gene with susceptibility for acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure.,"Excessive activation of innate immune response contributes to the pathogenesis of acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure (ACLF-HBV). miR-146a was recently found to be implicated in the regulation of innate immunity. In this study, we explored the biological significance of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2910164) within the miR-146a gene in the risk of acquiring ACLF-HBV. We completed a hospital-based case-control study including 717 cases of HBV-infected patients--251 cases of ACLF-HBV and 466 cases of chronic hepatitis B. Whole blood samples were collected for isolation of DNA and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The association between genotypes and risk of ACLF-HBV was analyzed by multivariate unconditional logistic regression, with adjustment for sex and age. Our results showed that the GG homozygote was a protective genotype in terms of susceptibility to ACLF-HBV, with odds ratio = 0.496, 95 % confidence interval = 0.309-0.797, P = 0.004 compared with CC+GC genotypes. The amount of mature miR-146a in PBMCs was significantly higher in the GG homozygote group than those in the CC and CG genotype groups of ACLF-HBV patients. The GG genotype group also represented lower serum level of TNF-α and higher survival rate (follow-up period = 4 months). In conclusion, The GG genotype within the pre-miR-146a is reversely associated with susceptibility of ACLF-HBV in the studied Chinese population. This may be partially explained by the relatively higher amount of mature miR-146a and the lower serum level of TNF-α in this genotype group."

However, the results are contestable. To assess the role of such variants in SMAD3 in OA susceptibility in peripheral joints OA, we conducted a case-control study in a Northeast Chinese population. The SMAD3 SNP was genotyped in patients who had primary symptomatic OA with radiographic confirmation and clinical symptom and in controls, and the associations were examined. A total of 111 knee OA patients, 121 hand OA patients and 236 controls were genotyped. Statistically significant difference was detected in genotype and allele frequencies between OA and control groups in the population. There were significant association for knee OA OR = 3.68 (95 % CI 2.03-6.70; p < 0.001) and for hand OA OR = 3.60 (95 % CI 2.01, 6.44; p < 0.001). The association was also positive even after stratification by sex except for male population of knee OA. Our data indicated that genetic variation in the SMAD3 gene is involved in pathogenesis of both knee OA and hand OA in Northeast Chinese population, which is consistent with in European populations."

23265959,23265959,Lack of association of WNT5A mutations with Müllerian duct abnormalities.,"The aim of this study was to determine if mutations in WNT5A contribute to the aetiology of Müllerian duct abnormalities (MDA) in 189 Chinese women. Three novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP; IVS2 - 115G >A, IVS4 + 66T >A, IVS4 + 102G >T) in introns 2 and 4 as well as one known SNP (rs62620048) in exon 6 were detected, but no causal mutations were observed. The results suggested that mutations in WNT5A may be not responsible for MDA in Chinese women. Genetic factors are considered to be one of the major causes of Müllerian duct abnormalities (MDA). Previous studies have shown that the WNT5A gene is crucial for the patterning and cytodifferentiation of the female reproductive tract. The study included 189 well-characterized patients with MDA who were screened for variants of WNT5A for the first time. Three novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (IVS2 - 115G >A, IVS4 + 66T >A, IVS4 + 102G >T) in introns 2 and 4 as well as one known single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs62620048) in exon 6 were detected, but no causal mutations were observed."

The associations of lipid profiles with disease risk differ by race/ethnicity, the reason for this is not clear. We aimed to examine whether there were additional genetic differences between racial/ethnic groups on lipoprotein profile. Genotypes were assessed using the Affymetrix 6.0 array in 817 related Caucasian participants of the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN). Association analysis was conducted on fasting mean particle diameters using linear models, adjusted for age, sex and study center as fixed effects, and pedigree as a random effect. Replication of associations reaching P < 1.97 × 10(-05) (the level at which we achieved at least 80% power to replicate SNP-phenotype associations) was conducted in the Caucasian population of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA; N = 2,430). Variants which replicated across both Caucasian populations were subsequently tested for association in the African-American (N = 1,594), Chinese (N = 758), and Hispanic (N = 1,422) populations of MESA. Variants in the APOB gene region were significantly associated with mean VLDL diameter in GOLDN, and in the Caucasian and Hispanic populations of MESA, while variation in the hepatic lipase (LIPC) gene was associated with mean HDL diameter in both Caucasians populations only. Our findings suggest that the genetic underpinnings of mean lipoprotein diameter differ by race/ethnicity. As lipoprotein diameters are modifiable, this may lead new strategies to modify lipoprotein profiles during the reduction of IR that are sensitive to race/ethnicity."

23255072,23255072,Association of a functional polymorphism in the promoter region of TLR-3 with osteoarthritis: a two-stage case-control study.,"Recent studies have suggested that polymorphisms in toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9), an endosomal TLR, are associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). TLR-3, -7, and -8 are also found on the surface of endosomes and to investigate whether similar associations exist with polymorphisms in these TLR genes we performed a two-stage case-control study and genotyped 11 TLR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 823 OA cases and 594 healthy controls by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism assays. Real-time PCR was performed to assess the functional expression of an identified promoter polymorphism in TLR-3 following dexamethasone stimulation of articular chondrocytes. An association between TLR-3 SNPs at rs3775296 and rs3775290 and OA was identified in both populations. In males the allelic frequencies of TLR-7 rs179010 and TLR-8 rs5744080 were significantly different between OA cases and healthy controls. The ATCA, CTCA, and CCTA haplotypes of TLR-3 were associated with OA susceptibility. A significant difference in TLR-3 gene expression following dexamethasone treatment was seen among the various genotypes of rs3775296 (p = 0.004). Our findings indicate that a SNP in the promoter region of TLR-3 is associated with elevated TLR-3 gene expression and susceptibility to knee OA in a Chinese Han population."

It was reported that the expression level of hDAB2IP in gastric cancer tissue was highly correlated with tumor progression, however, whether hDAB2IP genetic variants are associated with the risk of gastric cancer remains yet unknown. In this case-control study, we conducted a genetic analysis for hDAB2IP variants in 311 patients with gastric cancer and 425 controls from the Chinese Han population. We found that the SNP rs2243421 of hDAB2IP gene with the minor allele C significantly revealed strong association with decreased gastric cancer susceptibility (P=0.007, adjusted odds ratio [OR]=0.734, 95%CI=0.586-0.919). Haplotypes rs2243421 and rs10985332 (HaploType: CC, P=0.012, aOR=0.760) and haplotypes rs2243421 and rs555996 (HaploType: CG, P=0.034, aOR=0.788) represented the decreased risk of gastric cancer, respectively. On the contrary, rs2243421 and rs555996 showed an elevated susceptibility (HaploType: TG, P=0.010, aOR=1.320). Our results for the first time provided new insight into susceptibility factors of hDAB2IP gene variants in carcinogenesis of gastric cancer."

23207799,23207799,Genome-wide association study identified UQCC locus for spine bone size in humans.,"Bone size (BS) contributes significantly to the risk of osteoporotic fracture. Osteoporotic spine fracture is one of the most disabling outcomes of osteoporosis. This study aims to identify genomic loci underlying spine BS variation in humans. We performed a genome-wide association scan in 2286 unrelated Caucasians using Affymetrix 6.0 SNP arrays. Areal BS (cm(2)) at lumbar spine was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scanners. SNPs of interest were subjected to replication analyses and meta-analyses with additional two independent Caucasian populations (N=1000 and 2503) and one Chinese population (N=1627). In the initial GWAS, 91 SNPs were associated with spine BS (P<1.0E-4). Eight contiguous SNPs were found clustering in a haplotype block within UQCC gene (ubiquinol-cytochrome creductase complex chaperone). Association of the above eight SNPs with spine BS was replicated in one Caucasian and one Chinese populations. Meta-analyses (N=7416) generated much stronger association signals for these SNPs (e.g., P=1.86E-07 for SNP rs6060373), supporting association of UQCC with spine BS across ethnicities. This study identified a novel locus, i.e., the UQCC gene, for spine BS variation in humans. Future functional studies will contribute to elucidating the mechanisms by which UQCC regulates bone growth and development."

Recent studies indicate that the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3850641 in TNFSF4 is associated with higher risk of myocardial infarction, but little is known about the association between TNFSF4 variation and cerebral infarction (CI). A case-control study involving 385 CI patients and 385 age-matched, sex-matched non-CI controls was conducted in a Chinese population, only the most common subtype, atherosclerosis CI, was recruited. Two SNPs of TNFSF4, rs3850641 and rs3861950, were genotyped by the TaqMan SNP genotyping method, and verified partly by genomic DNA sequencing. The results revealed a significant allelic association between rs3861950 and CI (Odds ration = 1.733, 95 % confidence interval = 1.333-2.254, P = 0.000). Genotypic association analysis demonstrated that the CC genotype of rs3861950 confers susceptibility to CI (Odds ration = 2.896, 95 % confidence interval = 1.368-6.132), and it was associated with a significantly higher risk of ischemic stroke (Odds ration = 3.520, 95 % confidence interval = 1.546-8.015, P = 0.003) after adjusting for the other confirmed risk factors such as the history of hypertension, diabetes, CAD, smoking and alcohol drinking. While the odds ratio of the T allele to the C allele was 1.733 (95 % confidence interval: 1.333-2.254). However, there was no significant association between rs3850641 and CI (Odds ration = 1.288, 95 % confidence interval = 0.993-1.670, P = 0.056). TNFSF4 gene polymorphism rs3861950, but not rs3850641, is associated with the risk of atherosclerosis CI in a Chinese population."

Haplotype analysis revealed that one haplotype of GA was significantly associated with the disease (P=0.039, OR=1.184, 95% CI, 1.009-1.391). In the meta-analysis available studies, including our data, were combined using the STATA software package v.7.0. The meta-analysis revealed a significant association between FAS polymorphisms and SLE (rs2234767 A vs. G allele; P=0.004, OR=0.819, 95% CI, 0.715-0.938, rs1800682 G vs. A allele: P=0.034, OR=0.791, 95% CI, 0.637-0.983). In conclusion, FAS gene polymorphisms may contribute to SLE susceptibility in the Chinese population, and the meta-analysis shows that FAS polymorphisms may be associated with SLE susceptibility in different populations."
23192595,23192595,A non-synonymous SNP in the NOS2 associated with septic shock in patients with sepsis in Chinese populations.,"Sepsis represents a systemic inflammatory response to infection and its sequelae include severe sepsis, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and death. Studies in mice and humans indicate that the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS, NOS2) plays an important role in the development of sepsis and its sequelae. It was reported that several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within NOS2 could influence the production or activity of NOS2. In this study, we assessed whether SNPs within NOS2 gene were associated with severity of sepsis in Chinese populations. A case-control study was conducted, which included 299 and 280 unrelated patients with sepsis recruited from Liaoning and Jiangsu provinces in China, respectively. Six SNPs within NOS2 were genotyped using Sequenom MassARRAY system. The associations between the SNPs and risk of sepsis complications were estimated by a binary logistic regression model adjusted for confounding factors. Functional assay was performed to assess the biological significance. The GA + AA genotype of a non-synonymous SNP in the exon 16 of NOS2 (rs2297518: G>A) was significantly associated with increased susceptibility to septic shock compared with GG genotype in Liaoning population (OR = 3.29, 95% CI = 1.40-7.72, P = 0.0047). This association was confirmed in the Jiangsu population (OR = 3.49, 95% CI = 1.57-7.79, P = 0.0019). Furthermore, the functional assay performed in the immortalized lymphocyte cell lines indicated that the at-risk GA genotype had a tendency of higher NOS2 activity than the GG genotype (P = 0.32). Our findings suggest that the NOS2 rs2297518 may play a role in mediating the susceptibility to septic shock in patients with sepsis in Chinese populations."

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL6 that cause variations in host immune response may contribute to cervical cancer risk. In this two-stage case-control study with a total of 1,584 cervical cancer cases and 1,768 cancer-free female controls, we investigated associations between two IL6 SNPs and cervical cancer risk in Eastern Chinese women. In both Study 1 and Study 2, we found a significant association of the IL6-rs2069837 SNP with an increased risk of cervical cancer as well as in their combined data (OR 1.27 and 1.19, 95% CI 1.08-1.49 and 1.04-1.36, P = 0.004 and 0.014 for dominant and additive genetic models, respectively). Furthermore, rs2069837 variant AG/GG carriers showed significantly higher levels of IL6 protein than did rs2069837 AA carriers in the target tissues. Using multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses, we observed some evidence of interactions of the IL6 rs2069837 SNP with age at primiparity and menopausal status in cervical cancer risk. We concluded that the IL6-rs2069837 SNP may be a marker for susceptibility to cervical cancer in Eastern Chinese women by a possible mechanism of altering the IL6 protein expression. Although lacked information on human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, our study also suggested possible interactions between IL6 genotypes and age at primiparity or menopausal status in cervical carcinogenesis. However, larger, independent studies with detailed HPV infection data are warranted to validate our findings."
23171362,23171362,Association of interleukin-18 promoter polymorphisms with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in male smokers.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is considered a complex genetic disorder and it is expected that many genes play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Previous studies have reported that several variations within the interleukin (IL)-18 gene promoter region have been associated with different inflammatory diseases such as asthma. However, the association of IL-18 promoter polymorphisms with COPD has not been studied yet. We then performed a prospective case-control study to explore this association in male smokers of Chinese Han people. Our study recruited 112 COPD cases and 105 healthy controls matched for age. The genotyping of IL-18 promoter polymorphisms (-607 C/A and -137 G/C) was performed using TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping assays. The frequencies of the alleles and genotypes in patients and controls were compared. We found that the frequency of IL-18 -607 C allele was significantly increased in patients with COPD (odds ratio (OR) = 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01-2.15, P = 0.04). The frequency of IL-18 -607 C allele was significantly higher in the GOLD (Global initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease) 3-4 group compared with the GOLD 1-2 group (OR=2.06, 95% CI = 1.21-3.51, P = 0.01). There were no significant differences in the frequencies of the alleles and genotypes of IL-18 -137 G/C polymorphism between the patients and healthy smokers or between GOLD 3-4 group and GOLD 1-2 group. Our study revealed that the IL-18 -607 C/A polymorphism was associated with COPD susceptibility and severity of airflow limitation in male smokers of Chinese Han people."

23177411,23177411,Association of an oestrogen receptor gene polymorphism in Chinese Han women with endometriosis and endometriosis-related infertility.,"Endometriosis is a steroid-dependent complex disease. The oestrogen receptor plays an important role by mediating oestrogen action and eutopic or ectopic endometrium development. This study investigated whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genes for oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and oestrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) are associated with endometriosis and endometriosis-related infertility. The participants included 157 infertile and 155 fertile endometriosis women as well as 92 women with primary infertility and 265 fertile women as controls. The iPLEX Gold system (MassARRAY system, Sequenom) was used for genotyping of ESR1 and ESR2. Statistical analysis showed that ESR1 (rs3798573 A/G) was significantly associated with endometriosis and endometriosis-related infertility (P=0.011, P=0.009). No association was found with ESR1 (rs1159327 A/G, rs3020348 A/C) and ESR2 (rs17179740 A/G) either for endometriosis or endometriosis-related infertility. According to the revised American Fertility Society classification, all of the detected single-nucleotide polymorphisms had no association with endometriosis in stage I-II or in stage III-IV. The results suggest that the ESR1 polymorphism rs3798573 A/G is associated with increased risk of endometriosis and endometriosis-related infertility in Han women from central China. Endometriosis is an oestrogen-dependent complex disease, which is one of the most common causes of infertility. Oestrogen receptors (ESR), which mediate oestrogen actions, are considered to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Therefore, ESR may also play an important role in endometriosis-related infertility. To investigate the association between ESR and endometriosis or endometriosis-related infertility, detection of ESR polymorphisms have been carried out in several populations by other researchers; however, the results remain controversial. In a previous study of ours, through a pooling-based genome-wide scan of endometriosis and controls, we obtained two highly ranked single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that were individually located in introns of the genes ESR1 and ESR2. To find more evidence of a relationship between ESR and endometriosis or endometriosis-related infertility, the current study selected for genotyping another two ESR1 SNP from a Japanese genome-wide association study in endometriosis. According to the genotypes and the patients' histories, we found that the ESR1 polymorphism rs3798573 A/G was associated with risk of endometriosis and infertile endometriosis in Han women from central China."
23167762,23167762,Association of CYP46 gene polymorphism with sporadic Alzheimer's disease in Chinese Han populations: a meta-analysis.,"It is well known that genetic variants play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, several studies have found that an intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase (CYP46) gene was associated with sporadic AD (SAD). Within the CYP46 gene, the most well-studied SNP that has been found to be associated with an increased risk for SAD in Caucasians is the intronic SNP rs754203. Subsequently, other researchers have attempted to validate this finding in Chinese Han populations. However, these studies have produced both negative and positive results. To derive a more precise estimation for whether an association exists between rs754203 and SAD in the Chinese Han population, we performed the present meta-analysis of six case-control studies published up to July 2012 by searching the Medline, AlzGene, CNKI, and Wan Fang databases. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for four genetic models (allelic model: T vs. C; additive model: TT vs. CC; recessive model: TT + TC vs. CC; dominant model: TC + CC vs. TT) in the six studies, which included a total of 1187 cases and 1283 controls. The statistical analysis showed no significant differences in rs754203 between patients and controls for any of the four genetic models (p > 0.05 for each model). In conclusion, despite several limitations, this meta-analysis indicates that the CYP46 gene SNP rs754203 is not significantly associated with SAD susceptibility in Chinese Han populations."
23161053,23161053,TNFAIP3 gene polymorphisms confer risk for Behcet's disease in a Chinese Han population.,"The tumor necrosis factor alpha-inducible protein 3 (TNFAIP3) gene polymorphisms have recently been reported to be associated with the susceptibility to several immune-related diseases. This study was performed to evaluate the potential association of TNFAIP3 polymorphisms with Behcet's disease (BD) in a Chinese Han population. Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs10499194, rs610604, rs7753873, rs5029928, and rs9494885 of TNFAIP3 were genotyped in 722 BD patients and 1,415 healthy controls using a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between patients and controls using the χ (2) test. The results showed a significantly increased prevalence of the rs9494885 TC genotype and C allele in BD patients compared with controls (Bonferroni corrected p (p (c)) = 1.83 × 10(-10), odds ratio (OR) [95% CI] 2.03 [1.65-2.49]; p (c) = 8.35 × 10(-10), OR [95% CI] 1.81 [1.51-2.18], respectively).The frequency of the TT genotype and T allele of rs9494885 was markedly lower in BD patients than that in controls (p (c) = 1.23 × 10(-10), OR [95% CI] 0.50 [0.40-0.61]; p (c) = 8.35 × 10(-10), OR [95% CI] 0.55 [0.46-0.66], respectively). For rs10499194, a higher frequency of the CC genotype (p (c) = 0.015, OR [95% CI] 1.96 [1.30-2.97]) and C allele (p (c) = 0.005, OR [95% CI] 1.92 [1.28-2.90]), and a lower frequency of the TC genotype (p (c) = 0.015, OR [95% CI] 0.51 [0.34-0.77]) and T allele (p (c) = 0.005, OR [95% CI] 0.52 [0.35-2.97]) were found in BD patients. Concerning rs7753873, a higher frequency of the AC genotype (p (c) = 0.015, OR [95% CI] 1.49 [1.17-1.91]) and C allele (p (c) = 0.025, OR [95% CI] 1.39 [1.11-1.76]), and a lower frequency of the AA genotype (p (c) = 0.03, OR [95% CI] 0.68 [0.53-0.87]) and A allele (p (c) = 0.025, OR [95% CI] 0.72 [0.57-0.91]) were observed in BD patients. This study identified one strong risk SNP rs9494885 and two weak risk SNPs rs10499194 and rs7753873 of TNFAIP3 in Chinese Han BD patients."
23176674,23176674,Genetic variant I148M in PNPLA3 is associated with the ultrasonography-determined steatosis degree in a Chinese population.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an escalating medical problem worldwide. A nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism rs738409 (I148M) in patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) predisposes susceptibility to NAFLD; however, its association with steatosis grade is inconsistent in the literature. In particular, there was no significant association found between I148M and steatosis grade in two East Asian-based studies. In this study we aim to investigate whether I148M is associated with the ultrasonography-determined steatosis degree in Chinese adults."
23153004,23153004,Evaluation of the association between the ADRA2A genetic polymorphisms and type 2 diabetes in a Chinese Han population.,"Alpha-2-adrenergic receptor (ADRA2A) is involved in the sympathetic nervous system and plays a role in the regulation of insulin secretion and lipolysis. Recent studies have indicated that the ADRA2A polymorphisms are associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in Caucasians and African Americans. The present study aimed to evaluate the association between the ADRA2A polymorphisms and T2DM in a Chinese Han population. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs521674 and rs553668 in the ADRA2A gene were genotyped in 2094 Chinese subjects (1042 T2DM patients and 1052 nondiabetic controls) by using the TaqMan allelic discrimination technique. A single-locus analysis indicated that SNP rs553668 was associated with T2DM (p=0.04). Further analysis indicated that the association of SNP rs553668 was found in T2DM patients with body mass index (BMI)<25 kg/m(2) (p=0.03), but not in the patients with BMI≥25 kg/m(2) (p=0.56). This association was still significant in a recessive model (p=0.01, odds ratio=0.68, 95% confidence interval=0.51-0.92). In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that the ADRA2A polymorphism, rs553668, is associated with lean T2DM patients in a Chinese Han population. Further investigation to explore the role of ADRA2A in the regulation of body weight has been taken into our consideration."
23164360,23164360,Association of IL12B polymorphisms with susceptibility to Graves ophthalmopathy in a Taiwan Chinese population.,"Interleukin 12B (IL12B) gene polymorphisms have been linked to several inflammatory diseases, but their role in the development of Graves ophthalmopathy (GO) in Graves disease (GD) patients is unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the disease association of IL12B single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)."
23151749,23151749,Lack of association between STK39 and hypertension in the Chinese population.,"Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has identified serine/threonine kinase 39 (STK39) as a candidate gene for hypertension. A replication study provided supporting evidence that STK39 functional polymorphism rs35929607 was associated with hypertension. Recently, another study also showed rs6749447 within the STK39 was associated with blood pressure responses. However, these studies were all conducted in Caucasians. Thus, we carried out a case-control study to test whether STK39 is a common candidate gene for hypertension, and to examine the interaction of genetic factors and non-genetic risk factors in the Chinese population. Thousand twenty four hypertensive cases and 1024 controls were genotyped for five polymorphisms. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are located within STK39, and rs4977950, the SNP that showed the strongest signal is located in a gene desert. Results indicated that none of these SNPs was associated with hypertension in the Chinese population. Logistic regression analysis found body mass index (BMI) and triglyceride level were higher in the hypertension group when compared with the control group. Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis indicated that the interaction between BMI and rs4977950 may have an impact on hypertension. Taken together, the present study found no evidence that STK39 was associated with hypertension in the Chinese population. Instead, non-genetic risk factors such as BMI have an important role in Chinese hypertensive subjects, and the 'missing inheritability' requires further investigation."
23151416,23151416,Genetic variants at 10q23 are associated with risk of head and neck cancer in a Chinese population.,"A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) focused on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has identified several susceptible regions (5q11, 21q22, 6p21 10q23, and 12q24) in Chinese population. We hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in these regions for ESCC were also associated with the risk of head and neck cancer (HNC) which share similar risk factors with ESCC."

23137638,23137638,ZBTB38 gene polymorphism associated with body measurement traits in native Chinese cattle breeds.,"Body measurement traits, influenced by genes and environmental factors, play numerous important roles in the value assessment of productivity and economy. In this study, we investigated the association between genetic polymorphisms of the zinc finger and BTB domain containing 38 gene (ZBTB38) and body measurement traits in native Chinese cattle. Using direct DNA sequencing in 423 individuals of 8 different cattle subpopulations, 9 novel polymorphisms were identified for genotyping within 647 bp region of exon 1 of ZBTB38. Linkage disequilibrium and association analysis revealed that two coding exon polymorphisms (2323 G>A and 2325 C>T polymorphisms), missense mutations valine GTC(T) to isoleucine ATC(T), were associated with body length (BL), withers height (WH) and rump length (RL). Furthermore, the analysis of 2323 G>A and 2325 C>T SNP markers shows that there are significant effects on the BL (P=0.0488), WH (P=0.0044) and RL (P=0.0314) in the total population. These results clearly suggest that the ZBTB38 gene is among the target genes for body measurement traits in bovine breeding, and provide data for establishment of an animal model using cattle to study big animal body type."
23129427,23129427,Association of TLR4 gene non-missense single nucleotide polymorphisms with rheumatoid arthritis in Chinese Han population.,"Toll-like receptor4 (TLR4) plays an important role in the induction and regulation of the innate or adaptive immune responses. Thus, the genetic variation in TLR4 gene may influence the development of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Several studies have investigated the roles of genetic polymorphisms of TLR4 gene in RA, but most of these studies were restricted to two cosegregating functional missense polymorphisms Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile. To determine whether non-missense genetic polymorphisms located in regulatory region of TLR4 are related to RA in a Chinese Han population, four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) situated on 3' untranslating region (UTR) and 5' UTR were genotyped in 213 RA patients and 247 unrelated ethnically matched controls using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and direct sequencing techniques. Significant genetic associations were observed with the 3' UTR SNP rs41426344 and rs7873784. The minor allele C and homozygotic variant genotype CC of rs41426344 and minor allele C of rs7873784 were identified to be risk factors for the development of RA in Chinese Han people. Furthermore, by comparing the variation allele frequencies to other populations, prevalent genetic ethnic specificity was observed in all the four SNPs. Our study suggested that the effect of non-missense polymorphisms located in regulatory region would not be neglected in disease association analysis."
23129390,23129390,Identification of genetic associations of SP110/MYBBP1A/RELA with pulmonary tuberculosis in the Chinese Han population.,"Genetic factors play important roles in the development of tuberculosis (TB). SP110 is a promising candidate target for controlling TB infections. However, several studies associating SP110 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with TB have yielded conflicting results. This may be partly resolved by studying other genes associated with SP110, such as MYBBP1A and RELA. Here, we genotyped 6 SP110 SNPs, 8 MYBBP1A SNPs and 5 RELA SNPs in 702 Chinese pulmonary TB patients and 425 healthy subjects using MassARRAY and SNaPshot methods. Using SNP-based analysis with Bonferroni correction, rs3809849 in MYBBP1A [Pcorrected (cor) = 0.0038] and rs9061 in SP110 (Pcor = 0.019) were found to be significantly associated with TB. Furthermore, meta-analysis of rs9061 in East Asian populations showed that the rs9061 T allele conferred significant risk for TB [P = 0.002, pooled odds ratio (OR), 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08-1.43]. The MYBBP1A GTCTTGGG haplotype and haplotypes CGACCG/TGATTG within SP110 were found to be markedly and significantly associated with TB (P = 2.00E-06, 5.00E-6 and 2.59E-4, respectively). Gene-based analysis also demonstrated that SP110 and MYBBP1A were each associated with TB (Pcor = 0.011 and 0.035, respectively). The logistic regression analysis results supported interactions between SP110 and MYBBP1A, indicating that subjects carrying a GC/CC genotype in MYBBP1A and CC genotype in SP110 possessed the high risk of developing TB (P = 1.74E-12). Our study suggests that a combination of SP110 and MYBBP1A gene polymorphisms may serve as a novel marker for identifying the risk of developing TB in the Chinese Han population."
23111453,23111453,The common SNP (rs9939609) in the FTO gene modifies the association between obesity and high blood pressure in Chinese children.,"Previous studies have suggested that common variants in fat mass- and obesity-associated (FTO) gene are associated with body mass index (BMI) and the risk of obesity. Since obesity plays an important role in the etiology of high blood pressure (HBP), we aim to investigate the association between obesity and HBP in a population with different variants of the FTO gene. A total of 3,494 children (1,775 boys, 50.8 %) aged 6-18 years were recruited for measuring pubertal status, BMI and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The single nucleotide polymorphism rs9939609 of the FTO gene was genotyped. The blood pressure levels increased by 1.4, 1.5 and 1.8 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and 0.8, 0.9 and 1.2 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure per 1-unit BMI increase in subjects carrying TT, TA and AA genotypes, respectively. After stratifying for FTO rs9939609 genotypes (TT, TA and AA), the odds ratios (95 % confidence intervals) of HBP in obese versus non-obese children were 4.26 (3.18-5.71), 5.13 (2.96-8.90) and 10.37 (1.59-67.43), respectively, with adjustment for age, gender and pubertal status. The FTO rs9939609 SNP modifies the effect of obesity on HBP in Chinese children, with obese ones carrying the AA homozygous genotype of the FTO rs9939609 having the highest risk of developing HBP."
23118916,23118916,Genome-wide scan identifies variant in TNFSF13 associated with serum IgM in a healthy Chinese male population.,"IgM provides a first line of defense during microbial infections. Serum IgM levels are detected routinely in clinical practice. And IgM is a genetically complex trait. We conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants affecting serum IgM levels in a Chinese population of 3495, including 1999 unrelated subjects in the first stage and 1496 independent individuals in the second stage. Our data show that a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs11552708 located in the TNFSF13 gene was significantly associated with IgM levels (p = 5.00×10(-7) in first stage, p = 1.34×10(-3) in second stage, and p = 4.22×10(-9) when combined). Besides, smoking was identified to be associated with IgM levels in both stages (P<0.05), but there was no significant interaction between smoking and the identified SNP (P>0.05). It is suggested that TNFSF13 may be a susceptibility gene affecting serum IgM levels in Chinese male population."
23108955,23108955,Association study of IFIH1 rs1990760 polymorphism with systemic lupus erythematosus in a Chinese population.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease arising from the action of multiple genetic and environmental risk factors. The aim of this study was to examine the association of a single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs1990760, of the interferon induced with helicase C domain 1 (IFIH1) gene with SLE in a Chinese population. A total of 877 SLE patients and 978 healthy control subjects were enrolled in the present study. The genotype of the IFIH1 rs1990760 polymorphism was determined by Sequenom MassARRAY technology. The IFIH1 rs1990760 T allele was significantly increased in patient group compared with control subjects (T versus C, Odds ratio = 1.20, 95 % confidence interval = 1.02-1.40). However, no significant difference in genotype distribution was found between cases and controls (P = 0.07). No significant evidence was detected for the association of the IFIH1 rs1990760 polymorphism with SLE under neither dominant nor recessive model (TT + TC versus CC, P = 0.06; TT versus TC + CC, P = 0.08). We also analyzed the association of the IFIH1 rs1990760 T allele with clinical features, whereas no significant signal was found. In conclusion, our study represents the first report demonstrating an association of the IFIH1 rs1990760 polymorphism with SLE susceptibility in a Chinese population."
23109352,23109352,ANK3 as a risk gene for schizophrenia: new data in Han Chinese and meta analysis.,"Histological and neuroimaging evidence supports the hypothesis that neuronal disconnectivity may be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) showed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs10761482 in ankyrin 3 (ANK3), a major neuron-enriched gene, was associated with schizophrenia although inconsistent results had been reported. Two meta analyses reported another SNP rs10994336 in ANK3 gene confers risk to bipolar disorder (BD). Due to evidence of genetic overlap between schizophrenia and BD, we investigated common findings by analyzing the association of ANK3 polymorphisms (rs10761482, rs10994336, and two missenses, rs3808942 and rs3808943) with schizophrenia, using the Han Chinese population. A total of 516 schizophrenia cases, 400 controls, and 81 trios of early onset schizophrenia were recruited for association studies. Furthermore, the published datasets were combined with our results to determine the effect of the loci on schizophrenia. Our association study showed the frequencies of C allele of rs10761482 and T allele of rs10994336 were higher in patients than in controls. Furthermore, allele condition analyses indicated the association signal observed at rs10761482 and rs10994336 was independent. A haplotype analysis revealed the rs10761482-rs3808942-rs3808943 haplotype was associated with schizophrenia. The frequency of the T-T-T haplotype was higher in patients than in controls. In the transmission disequilibrium test analysis, the C allele of rs10761482 and the rs10761482-rs3808942-rs3808943 haplotype were preferentially transmitted in the trios. Meta analysis incorporating previous and current studies also showed rs10761482 and rs10994336 were associated with schizophrenia. We conclude that ANK3 gene has a major influence on susceptibility to schizophrenia across populations."
23104177,23104177,Fine-mapping of the 6q25 locus identifies a novel SNP associated with breast cancer risk in African-American women.,"The rs2046210 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 6q25.1 region was identified in a breast cancer genome-wide association study of Chinese women. The SNP has been replicated in European ancestry populations, but replication efforts have failed in African ancestry populations. We evaluated a total of 13 tagging SNPs in the linkage disequilibrium block around rs2046210 in a case-control study of breast cancer nested within the Black Women's Health Study, which included 1191 cases and 1941 controls. Replication of initial significant findings was carried out in 665 cases and 821 controls of African ancestry from the Women's Circle of Health Study (WCHS). No significant association was found for rs2046210 in univariate analysis. A new SNP, rs2046211, was significantly associated with reduced risk of breast cancer and was replicated in data from WCHS. In joint analyses that included both SNPs, the rs2046210-A allele was associated with increased risk of breast cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 1.14; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-1.28], and the rs2046211-G allele was associated with reduced risk (OR = 0.80; 95% CI = 0.67-0.95). Haplotype analysis confirmed these results and showed that the rs2046210-A allele is present in high-risk (rs2046211-C/rs2046210-A) and low-risk (rs2046211-G/rs2046210-A) haplotypes. Our results confirm the importance of 6q25.1 as a breast cancer susceptibility region. We replicated the rs2046210 association, after accounting for the haplotype background that included rs2046211 in African-American women, and we report the presence of a novel signal that is tagged by rs2046211."
23096927,23096927,Single  nucleotide polymorphisms in the ORM1-like 3 gene associated with childhood  asthma in a Chinese population.,"Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genome-wide association studies have revealed that polymorphisms of the ORM1-like 3 (ORMDL3) gene are associated with childhood asthma. We investigated genetic associations of SNPs in and around the ORMDL3 gene with childhood asthma in a Chinese population. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral venous blood drawn from 152 subjects with childhood asthma and from 190 control subjects. SNP genotyping was performed with the MassARRAY system (Sequenom) by means of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Among the six SNPs, only the genotype frequencies of rs7216389 were significantly different between asthmatic children and controls. Asthmatic children had a significantly higher frequency of T alleles [odds ratio (OR) = 1.653, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 1.170-2.333] in rs7216389, than controls. The TT genotype of rs7216389 was found to be a significant risk factor for childhood asthma by logistic regression analysis (OR = 1.704, 95%CI = 1.105-2.628). There was no significant association between the TT genotype of rs7216389 and clinical features of childhood asthma. We conclude that the ORMDL3 gene influences childhood asthma and that the TT genotype of the rs7216389 polymorphism is associated with childhood asthma in the Chinese population."
23098231,23098231,PTPN22 -1123G > C polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to primary immune thrombocytopenia in Chinese population.,"Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disorder characterized by autoantibody-mediated platelet destruction. Multiple factors have been implicated in ITP pathogenesis, including T-lymphocyte dysfunctions. The protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) gene encodes lymphoid-specific phosphatase (LYP), a critical negative regulator of T cell activation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PTPN22 have been broadly associated with susceptibilities to various autoimmune disorders. Here we conducted a case-control study investigating whether the PTPN22 -1123G > C SNP contributes to the risk of ITP in Chinese population. The study included 191 ITP cases and 216 ethnically matched normal controls. Genotyping of -1123G > C SNP was performed using a single-base extension (SBE) and mass spectrometry method. Allelic and genotypic frequencies were compared between the case-control groups by the chi-square test. We observed significant overrepresentation of -1123G allele (p = 0.034, odds ratio (OR) = 1.374, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.024-1.843]) and GG genotype (P = 0.038, OR = 1.951, 95% CI [1.031-3.694]) in the patients compared with the controls. Stratified analysis by gender and age of disease onset revealed comparable observations in both male and adult ITP cohorts. These data suggest a moderate association of PTPN22 -1123G > C SNP with susceptibility to ITP. Together with previous reports, our finding provides further evidence for PTPN22 being a general autoimmunity gene."

The present study was undertaken to detect the association of rs5888 SNP and serum lipid levels in the Guangxi Mulao and Han populations.
23088731,23088731,Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms of alcohol-metabolizing enzymes modify the risk of upper aerodigestive tract cancers: HapMap database analysis.,"Although alcohol is associated with higher upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) cancer risk, only a small fraction of alcoholics develop cancers. There is a lack of evidence proving the association of tag single nucleotide polymorphisms of alcohol-metabolizing enzymes with cancer risk. The aim of this study was to determine the association of these genetic polymorphisms with UADT cancer risk in a Chinese population. It was a hospital-based case-control candidate gene study. The databases of the International HapMap Project were searched for haplotype tag single nucleotide polymorphisms of the genes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)1B, ADH1C, and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)2. The genotyping was performed by the Sequenom MassARRAY system. Totally, 120 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, 138 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients, and 276 age- and gender-matched subjects were enrolled between June 2008 and June 2010.Minor alleles of ADH1B (rs1229984) and ALDH2(rs671) were not only associated with the risk of UADT cancers (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval, CI]: 3.53 [2.14-5.80] and 2.59 [1.79-3.75], respectively) but also potentiated the carcinogenic effects of alcohol (OR [95% CI]: 53.44 [25.21-113.29] and 70.08 [33.65-145.95], respectively). Similar effects were observed for head/neck and esophageal cancer subgroups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified four significant risk factors, including habitual use of cigarettes, alcohol, betel quid, and lower body mass index (P < 0.001). The haplotypes GAGC (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.08-2.40, P = 0.018) and CCAATG (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.24-2.30, P < 0.001) on chromosomes 4 and 12, respectively, were associated with higher cancer risk. These findings suggested that risk allele or haplotype carriers who consume alcohol and other carcinogens should be advised to undergo endoscopy screening. The information can be used to determine the degree of susceptibility of each subject and can be combined with other environmental factors, like carcinogen consumption, in the screening analysis."
23089282,23089282,Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) polymorphism is associated with Alzheimer's disease in Han Chinese.,"A review of pathogenic findings in Alzheimer's brains and the functional consequences of altered insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) input to the brain suggest the association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the disrupted IGF1 signaling. Recently, the identification of polymorphism rs972936 that was associated with both an increased risk of AD and high circulating levels of IGF1 was reported in Southern European population. In order to evaluate the involvement of the IGF1 polymorphism in the risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in Chinese, we performed an independent case-control association study in a Han Chinese population (794 LOAD cases and 796 controls). There were significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies between LOAD cases and controls (genotype P = 0.006, allele P = 0.047). The T allele of rs972936 demonstrated a 1.16-fold risk for developing LOAD when compared with the C allele, which diverges to the report in the Caucasian population. After stratification by apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4-carrying status, rs972936 polymorphism was only significantly associated with LOAD in non-ApoE ɛ4 allele carriers (genotype P = 0.002, allele P = 0.039). Multivariate logistic regression analysis also conferred this positive association between the SNP rs972936 and LOAD in the recessive and additive model after adjustment for age, gender, and the ApoE ɛ4 carrier status. These results suggest that IGF1 polymorphism has a possible role in changing the genetic susceptibility to LOAD in a Han Chinese population."
23079975,23079975,Association of  MHC class-III gene polymorphisms with ER-positive breast cancer in Chinese Han  population.,"Polymorphisms of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) have been linked to many diseases, especially autoimmune disorders. Previous studies have shown that genetic variants in MHC class III are associated with breast cancer. To determine if there is an association between MHC class III and breast cancer risk in the Chinese Han population, we carried out a hospital-based case-control study in Guangdong and Jiangsu Provinces, including 216 histologically confirmed breast cancer patients and 216 healthy controls. Nine SNP markers distributed in the class III-coding region were detected using the Sequenom MassARRAY(®) iPLEX System. Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed for seven SNPs. There was no significant association between these seven SNP variants and breast cancer in these Chinese women (unconditional logistic regression analysis). However, chr6_31697494 at BAT2, one of the seven SNPs, was found to be significantly associated with both ER- and PR-positive breast cancer. In addition, both chr6_31911109 at C6orf48 and chr6_31975605 at ZBTB12, another two of the seven SNPs, show relevance with ER-positive breast cancer. In conclusion, this is the first evidence that genetic polymorphisms in the MHC class III region are significantly associated with ER-positive breast cancer in the Han Chinese population."
23079002,23079002,PRM1 variant rs35576928 (Arg>Ser) is associated with defective spermatogenesis in the Chinese Han population.,"Protamine genes play important roles in DNA packaging within the sperm nucleus. In order to evaluate the association of PRM1, PRM2, KIT and KITLG variants with susceptibility to severely defective spermatogenesis, 309 male infertility patients (199 cases with non-obstructive azoospermia and 110 cases with severe oligozoospermia) and 377 controls were recruited in the Chinese Han population. This study genotyped 38 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in PRM1, PRM2, KIT and KITLG using Sequenom iplex. The results showed that PRM1 variant rs35576928 (p.R34S) was significantly associated with severe oligozoospermia and played a protective role against the disease (P=0.0079, Bonferroni correction, OR 0.426). The dominant model (variant-containing genotypes) of the SNP was confirmed to protect against the occurrence of oligozoospermia (P=0.0078, Bonferroni correction, OR 0.387). Haplotype analysis of PRM1 and PRM2 in combination exhibited that haplotype TACCGGC exhibited a significant protective effect against the occurrence of oligozoospermia when compared with controls (P=0.002, Bonferroni correction, OR 0.602). Haplotype TACCTGC was strongly associated with risk of the clinical phenotype severe oligozoospermia (P=0.002, Bonferroni correction, OR 2.716). The findings indicated that PRM1 variant rs35576928 (p.R34S) was associated with severely defective spermatogenesis in the Chinese Han population. Male spermatogenic failure may be associated with gene variants. We demonstrated whether such genetic variation of PRM1 and PRM2 affected clinicopathological characteristics and conferred susceptibility to this entity. In this study, we found that PRM1 variant rs35576928 (Arg>Ser) played a protective role against severe oligozoospermia. The dominant model analysis (variant-containing genotypes) confirmed that the SNP was a risk factor of a spermatogenesis defect. Haplotype analysis of PRM1 and PRM2 showed that TACCGGC was a common factor protecting against severe oligozoospermia, while the haplotype TACCTGC was strongly associated with the risk of the severe oligozoospmeria. Our findings indicate that the PRM1 variant rs35576928 (Arg>Ser) is associated with spermatogenesis defect in the Chinese Han population."
23076529,23076529,Association of growth/differentiation factor 1 gene polymorphisms with the risk of congenital heart disease in the Chinese Han population.,"There is evidence suggesting that genetic variants of Nodal signaling may be associated with risk of congenital heart diseases (CHDs), in which several polymorphisms, such as Nodal rs1904589, have been considered to be implicated in the accumulation of the genetic burden of CHD risk with interacting genes. We hypothesized that genetic variants of GDF1, a protein that heterodimerizes with Nodal, may be related to increased CHD susceptibility. In this study, four tagSNPs of GDF1 were genotyped in 310 non-syndromic CHD patients and 320 healthy controls by using PCR-based DHPLC and RFLP. The results showed no statistically significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies between CHDs and controls with any of the analyzed variants of GDF1. However, a weak statistical association existed between GDF1 rs4808870 and conotruncal defects (CTDs) (uncorrected P = 0.027). Further stratified analysis for subtype revealed the SNP AA genotype and A allele have statistical significance in pulmonary atresia (PA) (corrected P = 1.01 × 10(-3) and 0.015, respectively), especially in pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA + IVS) (corrected P = 1.67 × 10(-3) and 0.034, respectively). Furthermore, two haplotypes, TGGT and CAGT, were found to be significantly associated with increased CHD susceptibility (corrected P = 3.20 × 10(-3) and 2.73 × 10(-7), respectively). In summary, our results provide evidence that genetic variations of the Nodal-like factor, GDF1 may be associated with CHD risk, and these variations contribute at least in part to the development of some subtypes of CTD in the Chinese Han population."
23086272,23086272,"Association between 9p21.3 genomic markers and coronary artery disease in East Asians: a meta-analysis involving 9,813 cases and 10,710 controls.","Recently, genome-wide association studies on coronary artery disease (CAD) identified a series of associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an intergenic region of chromosome 9p21.3, near the CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes. We investigated the association of this locus with CAD in 12 case-control studies of East Asians and undertook a meta-analysis for effect size, heterogeneity, publication bias, and strength of evidence. English and Chinese language articles were tested for 9p21.3 SNPs with coronary heart/artery disease or myocardial infarction as primary outcomes. Included articles also provided race, numbers of participants, and data to compute an odds ratio (OR). Articles were excluded if reporting other outcomes (e.g., stroke). Thirty-five articles were initially identified and 12 were included. Independent extraction was performed by two reviewers and consensus was reached. SNP rs1333049, rs2383206 and rs10757278 representing the 9p21.3 locus, were genotyped in 12 case-control studies involving a total of 9,813 patients and 10,710 controls. For rs1333049 (8 data sets), using a fixed-effects model, the summary OR was 1.29 (95 % CI, 1.23-1.36, P = 0.001). For rs2383206 (6 data sets), using a fixed-effects model, the summary OR was 1.24 (95 % CI, 1.18-1.31, P = 0.001). For rs10757278 (6 data sets), using a random-effects model, the summary OR was 1.34 (95 % CI, 1.21-1.50, P = 0.001). In addition, we defined the haploblock structure of SNPs within the region of 9p21.3 in China population in one study. This broad replication provides unprecedented evidence for association between genetic variants at chromosome 9p21.3 and risk of CAD in East Asians."
23072570,23072570,Genetic polymorphisms in the osteopontin promoter increases the risk of distance metastasis and death in Chinese patients with gastric cancer.,"In vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that osteopontin (OPN) is associated with many types of cancers. However, no studies have reported the incidence of OPN polymorphisms and the risk of gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between OPN polymorphisms and gastric cancer in a Chinese patient population."
23068025,23068025,Association of PTEN genetic polymorphisms with atherosclerotic cerebral infarction in the Han Chinese population.,"The phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) gene is critical to the pathological development of atherosclerosis, a major risk factor for atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (ACI). However, it remains unclear whether genetic polymorphism in the PTEN gene can affect the risk of developing ACI. In the present haplotype-based case-control study, we investigated whether polymorphisms of the PTEN gene were associated with ACI in a Han Chinese population. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), we genotyped 300 patients with ACI and 204 matched healthy controls for five single nuclear polymorphisms (SNP) of the PTEN gene (rs2299939, rs17431184, rs555895, rs12357281 and rs2673836). Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype construction were analyzed using SHEsis software. We found that the rs2299939 PTEN intronic polymorphism was significantly associated with a risk of ACI in our Han Chinese population. The rs555895 and rs17431184C/T variants were not associated with risk of ACI. Two other polymorphisms were not detected in any subject in this study. The rs2299939C/rs17431184T/rs555895T PTEN haplotype was also significantly associated with risk of ACI. Our study provides the first evidence of an association between a PTEN intronic variant and the risk of ACI. It also provides new a new line of evidence for the critical role of PTEN in the development of stroke."
23058565,23058565,Association of rs1182 polymorphism of the DYT1 gene with primary dystonia in Chinese population.,"The deletion mutation of glutamate codon (GAG) in the TOR1A gene is a major cause of primary generalized dystonia. Recent genetic studies suggest that the rs1182 polymorphism in the same gene may represent a risk factor for primary dystonia. However, this finding has been inconsistent. Furthermore, no data on such an association in a Chinese population have been published."
23057512,23057512,Genetic factors related to gastric cancer susceptibility identified using a genome-wide association study.,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the major malignant diseases worldwide, especially in Asia, where Japan and Korea have the highest incidence in the world. Gastric cancer is classified into intestinal and diffuse types. While the former is almost absolutely caused by Helicobacter pylori infection as the initial insult, the latter seems to include cases in which the role of infection is limited, if any, and a contribution of genetic factors is anticipated. Previously, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on diffuse-type GC by using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) catalogued for Japanese population (JSNP), and identified a prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) gene encoding a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface antigen as a GC susceptibility gene. From the second candidate locus identified using the GWAS, 1q22, we found the Mucin 1 (MUC1) gene encoding a cell membrane-bound mucin protein as another gene related to diffuse-type GC. A two-allele analysis based on risk genotypes of the two genes revealed approximately 95% of Japanese population have at least one of the two risk genotypes, and approximately 56% of the population have both risk genotypes. The two-SNP genotype might offer ample room to further stratify a high GC risk subpopulation in Japan and Asia by adding another genetic and/or non-genetic factor. Recently, a GWAS on the Chinese population disclosed an additional three GC susceptibility loci: 3q13.31, 5p13.1 and 10q23."
23053986,23053986,DNMT3A rs36012910 A>G polymorphism and gastric cancer susceptibility in a Chinese population.,"DNA-methyltransferase (DNMT)-3A plays a crucial role in embryonic development and aberrant DNA methylation in carcinogenesis. Polymorphisms of the DNMT3A gene may influence its enzymatic activity and its contribution to susceptibility to cancer. This study evaluated the association of DNMT3A rs36012910 A>G with susceptibility to gastric cancer (GC) in a Chinese population. Genomic DNA was extracted from samples taken from 340 patients with GC and 251 healthy control subjects. The genotype frequency of DNMT3A rs36012910 A>G in all subjects was detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and confirmed by sequencing. Stratification analyses were used to study subgroups by age and gender and to evaluate the association of rs36012910 A>G polymorphism with genetic susceptibility to GC. All patients and control individuals were successfully genotyped for the DNMT3A rs36012910 A>G polymorphism. The frequency of DNMT3A rs36012910 allele G is 3.39 % in healthy individuals and 7.78 % in GC patients, respectively. The rs36012910 AG genotype was significantly more common in the GC group than in the controls, although the rs36012910 GG genotype was only one case in GC patients. Further stratification indicated that AG+GG genotypes were associated with susceptibility to GC in males older than 60, but this polymorphism has no significant association with GC susceptibility in females. Male individuals who carried AG+GG genotypes had a 2.362-fold increased risk of GC compared to those who carried the AA genotype. The rs36012910 allele G was associated with an increased risk of GC compared to the rs36012910 allele A. This is the first report to investigate the distribution and evaluate the association of a rare SNP in DNMT3A with genetic susceptibility to GC. DNMT3A rs36012910 A>G might become a potential biomarker for use in GC prediction, although further studies in larger groups and different populations are needed for confirmation."

23028439,23028439,Association of the DYX1C1 dyslexia susceptibility gene with orthography in the Chinese population.,"Several independent studies have supported the association of DYX1C1 with dyslexia, but its role in general reading development remains unclear. Here, we investigated the contribution of this gene to reading, with a focus on orthographic skills, in a sample of 284 unrelated Chinese children aged 5 to 11 years who were participating in the Chinese Longitudinal Study of Reading Development. We tested this association using a quantitative approach for Chinese character reading, Chinese character dictation, orthographic judgment, and visual skills. Significant or marginally significant associations were observed at the marker rs11629841 with children's orthographic judgments at ages 7 and 8 years (all P values<0.020). Significant associations with Chinese character dictation (all P values<0.013) were also observed for this single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at ages 9, 10, and 11 years. Further analyses revealed that the association with orthographic skills was specific to the processing of specific components of characters (P values<0.046). No association was found at either SNP of rs3743205 or rs57809907. Our findings suggest that DYX1C1 influences reading development in the general Chinese population and supports a universal effect of this gene."
23029525,23029525,Maternal transmission effect of a PDGF-C SNP on nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without palate from a Chinese population.,"Cleft lip with or without palate (CL/P) is a common congenital anomaly with a high birth prevalence in China. Based on a previous linkage signal of nonsyndromic CL/P (NSCL/P) on the chromosomal region 4q31-q32 from the Chinese populations, we screened the 4q31-q32 region for susceptibility genes in 214 trios of Han Chinese. PDGF-C, an important developmental factor, resides in the region and has been implicated in NSCL/P. However, in our family-based association test (transmission disequilibrium test; TDT), we could not conclude an association between PDGF-C and NSCL/P as previously suggested. Instead, we found strong evidence for parent-of-origin effect at a PDGF-C SNP, rs17035464, by a likelihood ratio test (unadjusted p-value = 0.0018; I(m) = 2.46). The location of rs17035464 is 13 kb downstream of a previously reported, NSCL/P-associated SNP, rs28999109. Furthermore, a patient from our sample trios was observed with a maternal segmental uniparental isodisomy (UPD) in a region containing rs17035464. Our findings support the involvement of PDGF-C in the development of oral clefts; moreover, the UPD case report contributes to the collective knowledge of rare variants in the human genome."

In this study, we used 4199 cases and 8255 controls from our previous GWAS to explore the association between 11q23.3 with subphenotypes of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Data were analyzed with PLINK 1.07 software. Significant associations were found for the SNP rs4639966 of 11q23.3 with SLE of age at diagnosis <20 years (OR = 1.18, p = 0.0049), malar rash (OR = 1.13, p = 0.01) and vasculitis (OR = 1.17, p = 0.02).

In this case-controlled study, peripheral blood samples were collected from 356 patients and 568 controls of Han Chinese origin. Genotyping was performed by a high-resolution melting curve. The impact of rs20455 on CAD and non-fatal MI was evaluated in a dominant genetic model with stepwise multiple regression analysis. There were no significant differences of genotypes and allele frequency between angiographic CAD and control groups (p > 0.05); however, that of MI and non-MI subgroups were significant differences (p < 0.05). After adjusting for significant risk factors, angiographic CAD risk was not significantly increased in 719Arg allele carriers compared with non-carriers. Further analysis revealed that the non-fatal MI risk and triglyceride levels were significantly higher in 719Arg allele carriers than non-carriers. In conclusion, KIF6 719Arg allele was not an independent risk factor for angiographic CAD susceptibility in Han populations from northern China. However, it was associated with a significantly higher TG level, which may indicate an increased myocardial infarction risk in angiographic CAD patients."
23001753,23001753,Genetic polymorphisms in centrobin and Nek2 are associated with breast cancer susceptibility in a Chinese Han population.,"Centrosome aberrations have been suggested to cause chromosomal instability and aneuploidy, and eventually promote cancer development. The Centrobin and Nek2 proteins interact with each other and both are involved in centrosome duplication and chromosome segregation. This study aimed to investigate whether genetic polymorphisms in these two genes may affect breast cancer susceptibility in Chinese Han population using a haplotype-based analysis. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in centrobin and four SNPs in Nek2 were genotyped in 1,215 cases of infiltrating ductal breast cancer and 1,215 age-matched cancer-free controls from Chinese Han population. The results showed that CATCG haplotype of centrobin was strongly associated with decreased breast cancer risk (adjusted OR = 0.14, 95 % CI = 0.09-0.22), which was mainly driven by the C allele of SNP rs11650083 (A>C, located in exon 12, resulting in Pro578Gln). None of the individual SNPs in Nek2 was associated with breast cancer risk. However, haplotype GTAT of Nek2 was associated with increased risk of breast cancer (adjusted OR = 1.56, 95 % CI = 1.18-2.06) and its risk was significantly elevated among women with both family history of cancer and a longer menarche-first full-term pregnancy (FFTP) interval (>11 years) (adjusted OR = 5.31, 95 % CI = 1.97-14.32). Furthermore, women harboring both at-risk haplotype GTAT of Nek2 and protective haplotype CATCG of centrobin were linked with decreased breast cancer risk, suggesting that the association between genetic variants of Nek2 and increased breast cancer risk was modified by genetic variants of centrobin. Our results indicate that genetic polymorphisms of centrobin and Nek2 are related to breast cancer susceptibility in Chinese Han women."
22963606,22963606,No association of catechol-O-methyltransferase polymorphisms with schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population.,"Genetics play a major role in the etiology of schizophrenia (SZ). Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is one of the promising candidate genes for SZ. A nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs4680, causing a Valine (Val) to Methionine (Met) substitution, has been widely studied in relation to psychiatric phenotypes, including SZ, but with conflicting results. We conducted a two-stage study to examine the association of COMT polymorphisms with SZ in the Han Chinese population."

As a novel prognostic molecular marker, this gene has drawn much attention in recent years for its potential utility in the risk prognosis and management of PTC. However, the contribution of the germline variants in this gene to PTC remains unclear. The study herein was aimed to investigate the potential association between the inherited BRAF variants and PTC based on a case-control study."
22960360,22960360,Association of the CR1 polymorphism with late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Chinese Han populations: a meta-analysis.,"It is well known that genetic variants play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In 2009, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) demonstrated that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs6656401, in complement receptor 1 (CR1) is significantly associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in Caucasian population. Subsequently, other researchers have attempted to validate this finding in Chinese Han populations. However, these findings in Chinese Han populations have produced both negative and positive results. To derive a more precise estimation for the relationship, we performed the present meta-analysis by analyzing three published association studies involving CR1 SNP rs6656401 through the use of the RevMan (v.5.1) program. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for allele contrasts (A vs. G) and a dominant model [(AA+AG) vs. GG] in three studies that included 1019 cases and 1080 controls, respectively. The statistical results showed a significant difference between patients and controls for the A allele of CR1 SNP rs6656401 (P=0.005). In addition, carriers of the A allele (AA+AG) of rs6656401 had a 1.69-fold increased risk for LOAD compared with non-carriers (GG) (P=0.01). In conclusion, despite there are some limitations, this meta-analysis indicates that the A allele of the CR1 SNP rs6656401 is significantly associated with LOAD susceptibility in Chinese Han populations."

22960237,22960237,Bivariate genome-wide association study suggests fatty acid desaturase genes and cadherin DCHS2 for variation of both compressive strength index and appendicular lean mass in males.,"Compressive strength index (CSI) is a newly established index for predicting hip fracture, the most serious consequence of osteoporosis. Appendicular lean mass (ALM), which influences skeletal strength of the lower limbs, is another trait associated with the risk of hip fracture. In this study, we performed a bivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify new candidate genes responsible for both CSI and ALM. In our discovery sample of 1627 unrelated Chinese subjects (802 males and 825 females), we scanned 909,509 SNPs using the Affymetrix Human Genome SNP 6.0 genotyping array. We successfully replicated our results in a sample of 2286 Caucasian subjects (558 males and 1728 females). The results indicated that five SNPs (rs174583, rs174577, rs174549, rs174548, rs7672337) in the FADS1, FADS2, and DCHS2 genes had significant bivariate associations with CSI and ALM in male subjects for both the GWAS discovery (with P<8.42×10(-6)) and the Caucasian sample (with P<0.07). We performed further replication analysis in a 2nd Caucasian sample with 501 Caucasian male subjects, using Affymetrix 500k arrays, and found that two of the above SNPs (rs174548 and rs174549, P=0.07) had bivariate associations with both CSI and ALM in males; the other 3 SNPs were not typed with the 500k array. The above findings suggest that the 3 genes, FADS1, FADS2, and DCHS2, containing these SNPs might play dual roles influencing both CSI and ALM in males. Our findings provide new insights into our understanding of the genetic basis of bone metabolism and the pathogenesis of osteoporosis."

22951725,22951725,Association analyses identify three susceptibility Loci for vitiligo in the Chinese Han population.,"To identify susceptibility loci for vitiligo, we extended our previous vitiligo genome-wide association study with a two-staged replication study that included 6,857 cases and 12,025 controls from the Chinese Han population. We identified three susceptibility loci, 12q13.2 (rs10876864, P(combined)=8.07 × 10(-12), odds ratio (OR)=1.18), 11q23.3 (rs638893, P(combined)=2.47 × 10(-9), OR=1.22), and 10q22.1 (rs1417210, P(combined)=1.83 × 10(-8), OR=0.88), and confirmed three previously reported loci for vitiligo, 3q28 (rs9851967, P(combined)=8.57 × 10(-8), OR=0.88), 10p15.1 (rs3134883, P(combined)=1.01 × 10(-5), OR=1.11), and 22q12.3 (rs2051582, P(combined)=2.12 × 10(-5), OR=1.14), in the Chinese Han population. The most significant single-nucleotide polymorphism in the 12q13.2 locus is located immediately upstream of the promoter region of PMEL, which encodes a major melanocyte antigen and has expression loss in the vitiligo lesional skin. In addition, both 12q13.2 and 11q23.3 loci identified in this study are also associated with other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus. These findings provide indirect support that vitiligo pathogenesis involves a complex interplay between immune regulatory factors and melanocyte-specific factors. They also highlight similarities and differences in the genetic basis of vitiligo in Chinese and Caucasian populations."

22942708,22942708,Risk-association of DNA methyltransferases polymorphisms with gastric cancer in the Southern Chinese population.,"DNA hypomethylation and/or hypermethylation are presumed to be early events in carcinogenesis, and one or more DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) have been suggested to play roles in carcinogenesis of gastric cancer (GC). However, there have been no systematic studies regarding the association between DNMT gene polymorphisms and GC risk. Here, we examined the associations of 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from DNMT1 (rs2114724, rs2228611, rs2228612, rs8101866, rs16999593), DNMT2 (rs11695471, rs11254413), DNMT3A (rs1550117, rs11887120, rs13420827, rs13428812, rs6733301), DNMT3B (rs2424908, rs2424913, rs6087990) and DNMT3L (rs113593938) with GC in the Southern Chinese population. We assessed the associations of these 16 SNPs with GC in a case-control study that consisted of 242 GC cases and 294 controls, using the Sequenom MALDI-TOF-MS platform. Association analyses based on the χ(2) test and binary logistic regression were performed to determine the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) for each SNP. We found that rs16999593 in DNMT1, rs11254413 in DNMT2 and rs13420827 in DNMT3A were significantly associated with GC susceptibility (OR 1.45, 0.15, 0.66, respectively; 95% CI 1.00-2.11, p = 0.047; 0.08-0.27, p < 0.01; 0.45-0.97, p = 0.034, respectively, overdominant model). These results suggested that DNMT1, DNMT2 and DNMT3A may play important roles in GC carcinogenesis. However, further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism."
22935916,22935916,Association between a COMT polymorphism and clinical response to risperidone treatment:  a pharmacogenetic study.,"A total of 130 Chinese schizophrenic patients (45 male, 85 female) were enrolled in the study. Clinical efficacy was determined using Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores. We genotyped 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the catechol-O-methyl transferase gene (COMT) in our patients and re-examined them for association with changes in BPRS scores after 8 weeks of risperidone monotherapy. COMT is one of the genes that confer susceptibility to schizophrenia, both because of its role in neurotransmitter metabolism and because of its location in the high-risk schizophrenia-related region 22q11. Recent studies also found that COMT functional polymorphisms influenced individual response to antipsychotic medication. Our aim in this study was to explore the influence of COMT polymorphisms on pharmacological response to risperidone in the Chinese population. Statistical analysis revealed a significant association between an upstream COMT SNP, rs9606186, and scores reduction of BPRS in all patients and in the male subgroup but not in the female subgroup (allele analysis: P=0.055 for all, P=0.012 for male patients; genotype analysis: P=0.046 for all, P=0.020 for male patients, uncorrected, odds ratio=3.95). The COMT gene polymorphism, SNP rs9606186, is associated with risperidone therapy efficiency in the Chinese population. This association exhibited a sexually dimorphic difference, which may shed light on the genetics of COMT and its enzymatic sex-dependent mechanism."
22932875,22932875,Association of adrenomedullin gene polymorphisms and blood pressure in a Chinese population.,"Genetic factors may determine an individual's blood pressure (BP) level and risk for hypertension. This study aimed to examine the associations between genetic variants of the adrenomedullin (ADM) gene and essential hypertension, as well as BP levels, in a Chinese Han population. In this study, 2410 hypertensive patients and 2346 normal controls were recruited. Three tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on the HapMap CHB data were selected and genotyped. No significant associations between the three SNPs of the ADM gene and hypertension status were observed. However, SNP rs4399321 was found to be associated with BP levels among the controls. GG homozygotes for this SNP had higher systolic BP (SBP) levels than carriers of the A allele (P=0.002). Particularly in non-drinkers, GG homozygotes had significantly higher SBP (116.9±0.9 vs. 113.7±0.3 mm Hg, P=0.001) and diastolic (74.0±0.7 vs. 72.6±0.2 mm Hg, P=0.046) BP levels than carriers of the A allele. Neither rs4910118 nor rs7944706 was associated with BP levels in the controls either before or after being stratified by drinking status. The results of this study showed that genetic variations in the ADM gene were not associated with the risk of hypertension in a Chinese population. However, the genotype at common variation rs4399321 may influence the BP level in normotensive subjects, especially among non-drinkers. In addition, replications in other populations and further functional studies are required to confirm and interpret the association of ADM with BP."
22999556,22999556,Association of CLOCK gene variants with semen quality in idiopathic infertile Han-Chinese males.,"Recent experimental animal studies suggested that the circadian locomotor output cycles kaput protein gene (CLOCK) may play an important role in male reproduction. So far, such data for humans are not available. This study used single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) to examine the association between CLOCK and semen quality in a human population with idiopathic infertility. Three-variant genotyping of CLOCK and semen analysis were performed in 478 men with idiopathic infertility by SNP genotyping assays and computer-aided sperm analysis. Subjects carrying a C allele at rs3749474 (CC and TC) presented significantly lower semen volume (P=<0.001 and 0.001, respectively) compared with the TT genotype. Subjects carrying the rs3749474 CC genotype had significantly lower sperm number per ejaculate (P=0.026) and sperm motility (P=0.021) than TT genotype carriers. rs1801260 TC genotype carriers had significantly lower sperm motility compared with the TT genotype (P=0.028). For the rs3817444 genotypes, CA and AA genotype carriers presented significantly lower semen volume compared with the CC genotype (P=0.022 and 0.001, respectively). The findings suggest, as far as is known for the first time, an association between CLOCK genetic variants and altered semen quality in a human population with idiopathic infertility. The gene encoding the circadian locomotor output cycles kaput protein (CLOCK) functions as an important positive enhancer of the circadian system. The observations reported in recent experimental animal studies suggested that CLOCK may play an important role in male reproduction. So far, such data for humans are not available. In this study, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were used to examine the association between CLOCK and semen quality in human population with idiopathic infertility. Three-variant genotyping of CLOCK and semen analysis were performed in 478 males with idiopathic infertility by SNP genotyping assays and computer-assisted semen analysis. The results showed that the subjects carrying a C allele at rs3749474 (CC and TC) presented significantly lower semen volume compared with the TT genotype. For subjects carrying the CC genotype, sperm number per ejaculate and sperm motility were significantly lower compared with TT genotype carriers. The rs1801260 TC genotype carriers also had significantly lower sperm motility compared with the TT genotype. For the rs3817444 genotypes, the CA and AA genotype carriers presented significantly lower semen volume compared with the CC genotype. The findings suggested, as far as is known for the first time, an association between CLOCK genetic variants and altered semen quality in a human population with idiopathic infertility."
25624819,25624819,No association between a polymorphism of the adenylate cyclase type IX gene and major depressive disorder in the Chinese Han population.,"Previous studies have demonstrated that a missense single-nucleotide polymorphism variant (2316A>G; rs2230739) of the adenylate cyclase type IX gene was associated with bipolar disorder and affective disorder. We determined genotype and allele frequencies using a ligase detection reaction method in 315 patients with major depressive disorder and 278 unrelated, sex-matched healthy control subjects. We did not detect any statistically significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies between patients and healthy control subjects. Furthermore, we found no significant difference between genders in major depressive disorder, nor between patients and controls in the same gender. These results suggest that 2316A>G (rs2230739) may not be a risk factor for increasing susceptibility to major depressive disorder in the Chinese Han population."

22914670,22914670,Association of IREB2 and CHRNA3/5 polymorphisms with COPD and COPD-related phenotypes in a Chinese Han population.,"Genome-wide association studies and integrative genomics approaches have demonstrated significant associations between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the chromosome 15q25 region that includes iron-responsive element binding protein 2 gene (IREB2) and CHRNA3/5 in non-Asian populations. We investigated whether IREB2 and CHRNA3/5 polymorphisms would be associated with COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes in a Chinese Han population. Eight SNPs (rs2568494, rs2656069, rs10851906, rs1964678, rs12593229, rs965604, rs13180, rs17483929) in IREB2 gene and four SNPs (rs16969968, rs1051730, rs938682, rs8034191) in or near CHRNA3/5 locus were genotyped in a case-control study (680 COPD patients and 687 controls). No significant associations were found between any of the SNPs and COPD in either former-smokers or current-smokers. Two SNPs (rs2656069 and rs10851906) in IREB2 were associated with COPD (P=0.045 and 0.032, respectively) in non-smoker. Four SNPs (rs1964678, rs12593229, rs965604 and rs13180) in IREB2 were associated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1))% predicted and three SNPs (rs16969968, rs8034191 and rs1051730) in CHRNA3/5 were both associated with FEV(1)% predicted and FEV(1)/FVC in COPD cases (P range 0.007-0.050). The SNP rs8034191 near CHRNA3/5 locus was significantly associated with pack-years of smoking in COPD patients (P=0.033). We demonstrated IREB2 polymorphisms were associated with COPD in non-smoking subjects, and the effect of IREB2 gene on COPD may be independent from smoking and independent from CHRNA3/5 gene cluster. Besides, we confirmed that SNPs in these two gene loci were associated with pulmonary function and CHRNA3/5 polymorphism was associated with pack-year of smoking in COPD patients in the Chinese Han population."

22902647,22902647,The single nucleotide polymorphism and haplotype analysis of MDR1 in Jiangsu Han population of China.,"The aim of this study was to perform the frequency distribution of MDR1 gene SNPs and haplotypes of Jiangsu Han population in China. A total of 225 Jiangsu Han unrelated volunteers were enrolled and genotyped by PCR-ASP method at three loci: C1236T (rs1128503), G2677T/A (rs2032582) and C3435T (rs1045642). In total, C and T were found at locus 1236, with the frequency of 35% and 65%, respectively. The most frequent allele at locus 2677 was G with the frequency of 44%, followed by T (41%) and A (15%). At locus 3435, C was more common (60%) than T (40%). The most common haplotype at loci 1236-2677-3435 was T-T-T (31.84%), at loci 1236-2677 was T-T (37.68%), at loci 2677-3435 was G-C (39.06%), and at loci 1236-3435 was T-T (34.28%). The haplotype linkage disequilibrium study found that all three loci were in linkage disequilibrium, such as T-T at loci 1236-2677, T-T at loci 2677-3435 and C-C at loci 1236-3435 (P<0.01). The dendrogram study indicated that the distribution of MDR1 SNPs in Jiangsu Han population were close to Japan and Malay populations and far away from European countries. These findings could shade new lights in population genetics and anthropology studies of Han-Chinese. It also provides basic data for research on MDR1 gene polymorphism, disease association and drug resistance study."

25624803,25624803,Association of Nurr1 gene mutations with Parkinson's disease in the Han population living in the Hubei province of China.,"Nurr1 defects could in part underlie Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, and Nurr1 gene polymorphism has been found in Caucasian patients with Parkinson's disease. In this study, heteroduplex technology was applied to compare the DNA sequences of eight exons of Nurr1 among 200 sporadic Parkinson's disease patients and 200 healthy controls in the Han population in the Hubei province, China. One allele amplified from exon 3 of Nurr1 was polymorphic in five Parkinson's disease patients (2.5%, 5/200), and two individuals had a polymorphic allele amplified from exon 2 (1%, 2/200). The anomalous electrophoresis fragment in exon 3 of Nurr1 gene contained a 709C/A missense mutation, and a polymorphic single nucleotide polymorphism at 388G/A was identified in exon 2. Compared with the control group, the Nurr1 gene expression level in the Parkinson's disease group was decreased, and the Nurr1 gene expression levels in Parkinson's disease patients carrying the polymorphisms at exons 2 and 3 were significantly decreased. Our data indicate that the single nucleotide polymorphism 388G/A in exon 2 and the 709C/A missense mutation in exon 3 of the Nurr1 gene in the Chinese population might affect the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease."

22871346,22871346,Further evidence for the association of genetic variants of ZNF804A with schizophrenia and a meta-analysis for genome-wide significance variant rs1344706.,"Recent accumulating evidence has indicated that ZNF804A (zinc finger protein 804A) may be one of the most robustly implicated genes in schizophrenia. In this report, we examined ZNF804A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) encompassing exon 4 by performing an association study that used a Han Chinese sample comprised of 492 schizophrenia patients and 516 healthy control subjects. A meta-analysis based on previous studies was also performed. For markers rs4667000 and rs1366842, significant differences in allele frequencies were found between cases and controls (Mantel-Haenszel corrected P=0.014 and P=0.025, respectively). Analysis of haplotype rs61739290-rs1366842 showed significant association with schizophrenia (global P=0.0018). Moreover, several other two-, three-, and four-SNP tests of haplotype association were also significant. A meta-analysis comprised of studies that utilized sample sets of either European and/or Han Chinese origin revealed statistically significant associations for two SNPs (rs1366842, P=0.002; and rs3731834, P=0.03) and schizophrenia. In addition, we observed a significant association between marker rsl344706 and schizophrenia (P<1.0×10(-5)) in combined populations. When we separately analyzed the studies by population, consistent and significant differences were found between cases and controls both in the European samples (P<1.0×10(-4)) and in the Chinese samples (P=0.03). In summary, we have added new evidence supporting the association between ZNF804A and schizophrenia in our Han Chinese sample. Further functional exploration of ZNF804A will greatly help us to elucidate the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and find promising new approaches for the treatment of this disorder."
22868082,22868082,Association between XRCC1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and infertility with idiopathic azoospermia in northern Chinese Han males.,"X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) is a scaffold protein that plays a critical role in DNA base excision repair. To explore the association between XRCC1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and infertility with idiopathic azoospermia in a northern Chinese Han population, PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to genotype a SNP locus (rs25487) of XRCC1 in 112 patients with idiopathic azoospermia and 156 healthy controls. Furthermore, nucleotide sequences were sequenced. The results showed that, compared with GG genotype, the GA and GA+AA genotypes showed a significant association with an increased risk of idiopathic azoospermia (OR 2.119, 95% CI 1.245-3.606, P=0.005), (OR 2.052, 95% CI 1.227-3.431, P=0.006) respectively. Meanwhile, the A allele frequency was significantly higher in azoospermic patients than that in controls (OR 1.472, 95% CI 1.029-2.105, P=0.034). The substitutions bring about an amino acid alteration: G→A changes the arginine residue into glutamine. In conclusion, the SNP locus rs25487 of XRCC1 could be a marker for genetic susceptibility to idiopathic azoospermia and the A allele might be a risk gene of idiopathic azoospermia in the northern Chinese Han population."
22851402,22851402,Genotypic association of the DAOA gene with resting-state brain activity in major depression.,"Compelling evidence suggests that the glutamatergic system may contribute to the pathophysiology of major depression (MDD). While the D-amino acid oxidase activator (DAOA) gene can affect glutamatergic function, its genetic associations with MDD and abnormal resting-state brain activity have yet to be elucidated. A total of 488 patients with MDD and 480 controls were recruited to examine MDD association for the DAOA gene in a Chinese population, of whom 53 medication-free patients and 46 well-matched controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging for regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis. The differences in ReHo between genotypes of interest were initially tested by the Student's t test, and the 2 × 2 (genotypes × disease status) ANOVA was then performed to identify the main effects of genotypes, disease status, and their interactions in MDD. Allelic association of the DAOA gene with MDD was observed for rs2391191, rs3918341, and rs778294 and haplotypic association for 2- and 3-SNP haplotypes. Six clusters in the cerebellum, right middle frontal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus showed genotypic association between altered ReHo and rs2391191. The main effects of rs2391191 genotypes were found in the right culmen and right middle frontal gyrus. The left uvula and left middle temporal gyrus showed a genotypes × disease status interaction. Our results suggest that the DAOA gene may confer genetic risk of MDD. Genotypic effect of rs2391191 and its interaction with disease status may contribute to the altered ReHo in patients with MDD. Glutamatergic modulation may play an important role in alteration of the resting-state brain activities."
22848100,22848100,Genetic variation of CTNNB1 gene is associated with susceptibility and prognosis of gastric cancer in a Chinese population.,"Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide with a low 5-year survival (S5y) after initial diagnosis. Although aberrant Wnt/β-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling has been observed in multiple human cancers, there is no information on the role of CTNNB1 polymorphisms in gastric cancer risk and S5y. We performed a genetic association study to analyse the correlation between the five tagged SNPs (tSNPs) (rs4135385, rs1798808, rs1880481, rs11564465 and rs2293303) of CTNNB1 and gastric cancer risk and survival. A total of 944 patients with complete follow-up information and 848 cancer-free controls were enrolled in this study. The rs1880481 polymorphism was correlated with decreased risk of gastric cancer [AC/AA vs. CC: adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.63-0.91], whereas the three other SNPs showed opposite effect (AG/AA vs. GG: adjusted OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.08-1.57 for rs4135385; GG vs. AA/AG: 2.09, 1.02-4.28 for rs11564475; TT vs."
22879957,22879957,Comparison of 6q25 breast cancer hits from Asian and European Genome Wide Association Studies in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC).,"The 6q25.1 locus was first identified via a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in Chinese women and marked by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2046210, approximately 180 Kb upstream of ESR1. There have been conflicting reports about the association of this locus with breast cancer in Europeans, and a GWAS in Europeans identified a different SNP, tagged here by rs12662670. We examined the associations of both SNPs in up to 61,689 cases and 58,822 controls from forty-four studies collaborating in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium, of which four studies were of Asian and 39 of European descent. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Case-only analyses were used to compare SNP effects in Estrogen Receptor positive (ER+) versus negative (ER-) tumours. Models including both SNPs were fitted to investigate whether the SNP effects were independent. Both SNPs are significantly associated with breast cancer risk in both ethnic groups. Per-allele ORs are higher in Asian than in European studies [rs2046210: OR (A/G) = 1.36 (95% CI 1.26-1.48), p = 7.6 × 10(-14) in Asians and 1.09 (95% CI 1.07-1.11), p = 6.8 × 10(-18) in Europeans. rs12662670: OR (G/T) = 1.29 (95% CI 1.19-1.41), p = 1.2 × 10(-9) in Asians and 1.12 (95% CI 1.08-1.17), p = 3.8 × 10(-9) in Europeans]. SNP rs2046210 is associated with a significantly greater risk of ER- than ER+ tumours in Europeans [OR (ER-) = 1.20 (95% CI 1.15-1.25), p = 1.8 × 10(-17) versus OR (ER+) = 1.07 (95% CI 1.04-1.1), p = 1.3 × 10(-7), p(heterogeneity) = 5.1 × 10(-6)]. In these Asian studies, by contrast, there is no clear evidence of a differential association by tumour receptor status. Each SNP is associated with risk after adjustment for the other SNP. These results suggest the presence of two variants at 6q25.1 each independently associated with breast cancer risk in Asians and in Europeans. Of these two, the one tagged by rs2046210 is associated with a greater risk of ER- tumours."
22839215,22839215,Common ALDH2 genetic variants predict development of hypertension in the SAPPHIRe prospective cohort: gene-environmental interaction with alcohol consumption.,Genetic variants near/within the ALDH2 gene encoding the mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 have been associated with blood pressure and hypertension in several case-control association studies in East Asian populations.
22832384,22832384,Genetic variants at 5p12 and risk of breast cancer in Han Chinese.,"A genome-wide association study, conducted among women of European ancestry, has identified two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs4415084 (T>C) and rs10941679 (A>G) at chromosome 5p12 were associated with risk of breast cancer, suggesting that genetic variants in this region may have a role in the development of breast cancer. To investigate the associations between SNPs at 5p12 and risk of breast cancer in the Chinese population, we conducted a fine-mapping in 5p12 using a haplotype-tagging SNP approach and genotyped these SNPs with a case-control study consisting of 878 cases and 900 controls. We found that the two risk SNPs reported in the European population were neither associated with breast cancer risk in our Chinese population, nor did the fine-mapping SNPs after controlling multiple comparison."

22816799,22816799,Association of interleukin-17A and -17F gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms with autoimmune thyroid diseases.,"Th17 lymphocyte and its relative cytokines have been shown to play an important role in autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between IL-17A and IL-17F gene polymorphisms and two main types of AITD, Graves' disease (GD) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). Whole blood specimens and clinical data were collected from 508 AITD patients (326 with GD and 182 with HT) and 224 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, respectively. IL-17A (rs2275913, rs8193037, rs3819025) polymorphism was determined using DNA sequencing method and IL-17F/rs763780 polymorphism was assayed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR -RFLP). The results indicated that the frequencies of IL-17F/rs763780 genotypes in patients with GD and HT differed significantly from their controls (P = 0.013 and P = 0.005, respectively); the G allele frequencies were also significantly higher in the patient groups than the control groups (P = 0.002 and 0.001, respectively). For IL-17A/rs2275913 and rs8193037 SNP, no significant difference was observed in patients with either GD or HT compared to the control groups (P>0.05). Interestingly, for rs3819025, the frequency of A allele was lower in patients with GD than controls (P = 0.011). The frequencies of haplotype AGGG and GGGG in patients with GD and HT were significantly higher than in controls (P = 0.012, P = 0.019, P = 0.017 and P = 0.029, respectively). In conclusion, the results indicate that IL-17F/rs763780 polymorphisms may affect the susceptibility to AITD, and IL-17A/rs3819025 SNP is likely a protective factor to GD in the Chinese population."

22852072,22852072,Identification of TNIP1 Polymorphisms by High Resolution Melting Analysis with Unlabelled Probe: Association with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.,"Background. TNFα-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) interacting with protein 1 (TNIP1) acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB and plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of immune system. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) showed that the polymorphism of TNIP1 was associated with the disease risk of SLE in Caucasian. In this study, we investigated whether the association of TNIP1 with SLE was replicated in Chinese population. Methods. The association of TNIP1 SNP rs7708392 (G/C) was determined by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis with unlabeled probe in 285 SLE patients and 336 healthy controls. Results. A new SNP rs79937737 located on 5 bp upstream of rs7708392 was discovered during the HRM analysis. No association of rs7708392 or rs79937737 with the disease risk of SLE was found. Furthermore, rs7708392 and rs79937737 were in weak linkage disequilibrium (LD). Hypotypes analysis of the two SNPs also showed no association with SLE in Chinese population. Conclusions. High resolution melting analysis with unlabeled probes proves to be a powerful and efficient genotyping method for identifying and screening SNPs. No association of rs7708392 or rs79937737 with the disease risk of SLE was observed in Chinese population."

22807154,22807154,Susceptibility genes for osteoporotic fracture in postmenopausal Chinese women.,"To identify the susceptibility genes for osteoporotic fracture in postmenopausal Chinese women, a two-stage case-control association study using joint analysis was conducted in 1046 patients with nontraumatic vertebra, hip, or distal radius fractures and 2303 healthy controls. First, 113 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 16 potential osteoporosis candidate genes reported in recent genomewide association studies, meta-analyses studies, large-scale association studies, and functional studies were genotyped in a small-sample-size subgroup consisting of 541 patients with osteoporotic fractures and 554 healthy controls. Variants and haplotypes in SPTBN1, TNFRSF11B, CNR2, LRP4, and ESR1 that have been identified as being associated with osteoporotic fractures were further reanalyzed in the entire case-control group. We identified one SNP in TNFRSF11B (rs3102734), three SNPs in ESR1 (rs9397448, rs2234693, and rs1643821), two SNPs in LRP4 (rs17790156 and rs898604), and four SNPs in SPTBN1 (rs2971886, rs2941583, rs2941584, and rs12475342) were associated with all of the broadly defined osteoporotic fractures. The most significant polymorphism was rs3102734, with increased risk of osteoporotic fractures (odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-1.55, Bonferroni p = 2.6 × 10(-4) ). Furthermore, rs3102734, rs2941584, rs12475342, rs9397448, rs2234693, and rs898604 exhibited significant allelic, genotypic, and/or haplotypic associations with vertebral fractures. SNPs rs12475342, rs9397448, and rs2234693 showed significant genotypic associations with hip fractures, whereas rs3102734, rs2073617, rs1643821, rs12475342, and rs2971886 exhibited significant genotypic and/or haplotypic associations with distal radius fractures. Accordingly, we suggest that in addition to the clinical risk factors, the variants in TNFRSF11B, SPTBN1, ESR1, and LRP4 are susceptibility genetic loci for osteoporotic fracture in postmenopausal Chinese women."
22815195,22815195,GSK3β reduces risk of sporadic Parkinson's disease in ethnic Chinese.,"Genetic variability of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) may be linked to Parkinson's disease (PD). Its role in ethnic Chinese population is still unclear. We examined the association between GSK3β variation and PD in a Han Chinese population from mainland China. Using a case-control methodology, we genotyped the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in GSK3β (rs334558) to investigate the association with risk of PD. A total of 1,280 ethnic Han Chinese study subjects comprising 761 sporadic PD patients and 519 controls were recruited. The T allele of a promoter SNP rs334558 was found to reduce the risk of PD (OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.696-0.960, P = 0.014). Patients with CT + TT genotypes have a reduced risk of PD compared to those with CC genotype (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.477-0.776, P = 6.09E-5). In addition, we demonstrated that CT + TT subjects cannot be distinguished from CC subjects based on their clinical features. Our data suggest that rs334558 variant in GSK3β reduces the risk of PD in a Han Chinese population from mainland China. Further studies of large series of subjects are necessary to fully elucidate the true role of GSK3β in PD."

22864923,22864923,Genome-wide association study identifies TNFSF13 as a susceptibility gene for IgA in a South Chinese population in smokers.,"IgA is an important factor in our immune system. There are many diseases associated with it, such as IgA nephropathy, IgA deficiency, and so on. In order to describe the relationship between the genes and the IgA level, we performed a genome-wide association study of serum IgA with 1,999 healthy Chinese men in the first stage and replicated on an independent Chinese sample with 1,496 subjects in the second stage. Association between each SNP with IgA was estimated by multivariate linear regression analysis conditioned on age and smoke. Haplotype analysis for the block around the top SNP was performed. In the first stage, one genomic locus was identified to be significantly associated with IgA. The loci is TNFSF13 (17p13.1; rs3803800; P = 6.26 × 10(-8)). In smoke-specific analysis, rs3803800 was approximately significantly associated with IgA levels in smokers (P = 3.96 × 10(-7)), while no association was observed in nonsmokers (P = 2.28 × 10(-1)). In addition, we performed the haplotype analysis on chromosome 17 with the SNPs around rs3803800. Although the total P value for the haplotype did not acquire significant difference, three haplotypes (TGAG, CACG, and CACA) reached significant (P < 0.05). In conclusion, TNFSF13 could be a susceptible gene which was discovered having relationship with serum IgA level, and smoke might be a factor infecting the IgA level."

A total of 605 independent SLE patients and 666 unrelated healthy controls were recruited for the case-control association study. Two SNPs (rs2221903 and rs907715) within the IL-21 gene intronic region were genotyped by TaqMan SNP allelic discrimination methods. The allele T frequency of SNP rs2221903 in patients and healthy controls was 89.4 % and 86.8 %, respectively [T versus C, odds ratio (OR) = 1.287, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.010-1.640]. No significant differences in genotype frequencies were shown between SLE patients and healthy controls (P value = 0.705, 0.406, respectively). However, the effect of recessive model (TT versus CC + CT, OR = 1.368, 95 % CI = 1.050-1.781) was observed.

A number of genomic loci have been associated with pathological myopia, but only a few have been validated. This study further evaluated the association of polymorphisms in the CTNND2 gene and the 11q24.1 genomic region with pathological myopia. Both regions had previously been implicated in carrying susceptibility genes for this eye disorder. Genotypic and association analyses were performed on 24 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CTNND2 and 11q21.1 genomic regions of 321 subjects with pathological myopia and 310 control subjects with normal vision using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Allele and genotype frequency analyses found that the distribution of variants of the SNP rs1479617 located in the CTNND2 gene significantly differed between the pathological myopia and control groups. Haplotype linkage analysis identified 2 genomic blocks in 11q24.1 that were independently associated with pathological myopia. Specific polymorphisms in the CTNND2 gene and 11q24.1 genomic region were found to be significantly associated with pathological myopia in this Chinese population, further supporting the idea that these genomic regions carry susceptibility loci for this disease."

22744456,22744456,"Mutation analysis of MESP2, HES7 and DUSP6 gene exons in patients with congenital scoliosis.","MESP2, HES7 and DUSP6 genes have been proved to be involved in the etiopathogenesis of congenital scoliosis (CS) in animal embryo studies, however, whether this association was detected in human CS patients also remains unknown. One hundred sporadic and non-syndromic CS patients and 100 age-matched normal controls were included in this study. Mutation screening of gene exons were performed by DNA sequencing. However, no mutation or new single nucleotide polymorphism was found in the exons of MESP2, HES7 and DUSP6 genes in CS patients and normal controls. MESP2, HES7 and DUSP6 genes may not be involved in the etiopathogenesis of sporadic and non-syndromic CS in Chinese Han population."
22744421,22744421,Replication study of PLCE1 and C20orf54 polymorphism and risk of esophageal cancer in a Chinese population.,"Esophageal cancer is one of the most aggressive cancers in the world. Recent large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reported that functional genetic variations in the phospholipase C epsilon gene (PLCE1) were strongly associated with risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) in Chinese population. For C20orf54 rs13042395 genotype and risk of esophageal cancer, the results were inconsistent. We conducted a replication case-control study to evaluate the genetic effects of these two functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the development of esophageal cancer. A total of 380 cases and 380 controls were recruited for this study. The genotypes were determined by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS). The variant alleles of the functional polymorphism, PLCE1 rs2274223 SNP was associated with the increased risk of esophageal cancer [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.95, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.05-3.59 for PLCE1 rs2274223 GG vs. AA]. However, there was no significant association between the C20orf54 rs13042395 genotype and esophageal cancer risk (adjusted OR = 0.99, 95 % CI = 0.63-1.57 for C20orf54 rs13042395 TT vs. CC). Stratified analyses indicated a significantly increased risk of esophageal cancer associated with the PLCE1 rs2274223 AG genotype was more evident among females, younger patients and never drinkers, compared with the PLCE1 rs2274223 AA genotypes. Stratified analyses also indicated a significantly increased risk of esophageal cancer associated with the PLCE1 rs2274223 GG genotype was more evident among never smokers and never drinkers compared with the PLCE1 rs2274223 AA genotypes. These findings indicated that functional polymorphisms PLCE1 rs2274223 might contribute to esophageal cancer susceptibility."
22742858,22742858,Association of tuberculosis and polymorphisms in the promoter region of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in a Southwestern China Han population.,"The macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of immune diseases. High levels of MIF have been detected in the sera of patients with tuberculosis (TB), and it has been proposed that MIF gene polymorphisms may influence the risk of developing TB. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential relationship between functional polymorphisms of MIF and TB in a Han population from Southwestern China. TB patients (n=215) and healthy unrelated controls (n=245) were recruited for this study. Genomic DNA was isolated from all the participants. The MIF-173 G/C SNP was genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The MIF-794 CATT(5-8) microsatellite was evaluated by direct sequencing of the subsequent PCR products. Association analysis of the two polymorphisms showed that the frequency of -173 (GC+CC) in TB patients and controls was 49.3% and 31.4%, respectively, which was statistically significant (OR=2.12, 95% CI=1.45-3.10, P<0.001); the frequencies of -794 (7/X+8/X) were 56.7% and 45.3%, respectively, also statistically significant between the TB and healthy controls (OR=1.58, 95% CI=1.10-2.29, P=0.015). In summary, Genetic variation in the MIF gene is closely associated with tuberculosis. Both the 173 (GC+CC) SNP and -794 (7/X+8/X) microsatellite increased the risk of Chinese Han developing TB."
22744181,22744181,Bivariate genome-wide association study suggests that the DARC gene influences lean body mass and age at menarche.,"Lean body mass (LBM) and age at menarche (AAM) are two important complex traits for human health. The aim of this study was to identify pleiotropic genes for both traits using a powerful bivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS). Two studies, a discovery study and a replication study, were performed. In the discovery study, 909622 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 801 unrelated female Han Chinese subjects using the Affymetrix human genome-wide SNP array 6.0 platform. Then, a bivariate GWAS was performed to identify the SNPs that may be important for LBM and AAM. In the replication study, significant findings from the discovery study were validated in 1692 unrelated Caucasian female subjects. One SNP rs3027009 that was bivariately associated with left arm lean mass and AAM in the discovery samples (P=7.26×10(-6)) and in the replication samples (P=0.005) was identified. The SNP is located at the upstream of DARC (Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines) gene, suggesting that DARC may play an important role in regulating the metabolisms of both LBM and AAM."
22729880,22729880,Association study of ACE polymorphisms and systemic lupus erythematosus in Northern Chinese Han population.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease, with multiple genetic and environmental factors involving in its etiology. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene was reported to have important roles in the development and progression of SLE. In this study, a case-control study was carried out to investigate the effects of seven SNPs and I/D in ACE gene in the development of SLE in Northern China. Seven SNPs including A5466C, T3892C, A240T, C1237T, G2215A, A2350G and C3409T were genotyped by PCR-RFLP method, and I/D was examined by agarose gel electrophoresis followed PCR directly. 314 SLE patients were compared to 320 normal controls in the study. Data were analyzed by SPSS 13.0 and HaploView software. The frequency distribution of SNP A2350G and Alu I/D and five haplotypes (AAAACCCI, AGAACCTD, AAAATCTI, TAAATTTI and TAAATCTI) were demonstrated to be different between case and control groups significantly. Whereas other SNPs and haplotypes had no differences in two cohorts. The results revealed that variations of ACE gene had association with SLE, which indicated ACE gene may play an important role in pathogenesis of SLE in Northern Chinese Han population."
22736055,22736055,Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the TSPYL-4 and NT5DC1 genes are             associated with susceptibility to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"The risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is partially             determined by genetic and environmental factors. Many published candidate gene             studies show conflicting results due to ethnic differences and sample sizes. The             number of these studies carried out in Chinese populations is small. To investigate             candidate genes and haplotypes for susceptibility to COPD in a southern Han Chinese             population, we performed genotyping of DNA samples in 200 COPD patients and 250 control             subjects by analyzing 54 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 23 genes associated             with the development of COPD and/or pulmonary function identified by genome-wide             association studies (GWAS). We also performed linkage disequilibrium (LD) and             haplotype analysis according to the results of genotyping. The frequencies of             the SNP [rs3749893 of testis‑specific protein Y-encoded-like 4 (TSPYL-4) gene]             G allele and SNP [rs1052443 of 5'-nucleotidase domain containing 1 (NT5DC1) gene]             A allele were significantly higher in the cases studied compared to the control             subjects (P=0.032, P<0.05, OR=0.692, 95% CI 0.495‑0.970; P=0.0205, P<0.05,             OR=0.670, 95% CI 0.477-0.941, respectively). Results showed that two blocks of             SNPs (rs1052443 and rs3749893; rs11155242 and rs6937121) had sufficient precision             to allow construction of a haplotype block. We constructed the TSPYL-4 and NT5DC1             haplotypes of the cases and controls, but no significant difference between the             two groups was found. rs3749893 A allele of TSPYL-4 and rs1052443 C allele of             NT5DC1 were associated with a protective effect against the deterioration of pulmonary             function. In conclusion, TSPYL-4 and NT5DC1 gene polymorphisms are associated             with susceptibility to COPD and pulmonary function."
22711332,22711332,A single nucleotide polymorphism in microRNA-146a is associated with the risk for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,"A common GC polymorphism within miRNA-146a precursor region (rs2910164) has been associated with the risk of various cancers despite the underlying mechanism is unclear. In the current study, we aimed to examine the role of rs2910164 in the pathogenesis and predisposition to nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The GC polymorphism in 233 NPC patients, 173 matched controls and 3613 healthy elderly subjects in our locality were first determined using melting temperature (T(m))-shift allele-specific genotyping method. Results in our case-control study indicated that CC genotype was associated with the risk effect of NPC (adjusted odds ratio of GC + GG vs. CC, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.69; P < 0.0001). Using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, we subsequently revealed that expressions of both miR-146a and its passenger strand (miR-146a*C or miR-146a*G) were increased in NPC samples (P < 0.001), albeit expression of miR-146a was not linked to the genotype. Furthermore, miR-146a*C in NPC was significantly increased in CC genotype (CC vs. GC, P = 0.038). Finally, we demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays that all three miR-146a precursor-derived mature miRNAs interacted with Argonaute2 (Ago2) protein complex and could function as gene silencers. Taken together, our results showed that the variant C in rs2910164 was associated with the predisposition of NPC in Chinese population. This polymorphism may influence the risk of NPC by producing active mature miR-146a*C that regulate distinct set of target genes. These findings may enrich our understanding of how miRNA single nucleotide polymorphism affect NPC pathogenesis, and may have potential implications to improve NPC treatment in the future."

22673923,22673923,An association study of SNP + 45 T > G of the AdipoQ gene with type 2 diabetes in Yi and Han people in China.,"The Yi people are considered the most primitive society in China, and live in the remote mountainous areas of Southwestern China. There have been no previous publications on genetic research concerning type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the Yi people. This is the first report that presents the association between SNP + 45 T > G (rs2241766) of the AdipoQ gene and T2D in Yi people. Our previous study showed that the prevalence of T2D in Yi people was lower than the national level in 2008. Genetic differences between Yi and Han people might be one possible explanation for this observation. Studies on the single nucleotide polymorphism SNP + 45 T > G (rs2241766) of the AdipoQ gene in Chinese Han people showed inconsistent results. This study was designed to identify genetic variants of the AdipoQ gene that contribute to the development of T2D in Yi and Han people."

In rats, selective inhibition of the LOX pathway led to defective ovulation. However, little is known about the association of the LOX-related genes with menstruation in women. In this study, we investigated the possible association of two key gene (ALOX12 and ALOX15) polymorphisms with age of menarche and menopause in Chinese women."
22666261,22666261,The Association of IL-12b Polymorphisms with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in Chinese Han Population.,"Background. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex immune disease. The genetic variation in the IL-12b gene was found to associate with SLE in Caucasian population. In this study, we examined this association in Chinese Han population by a recently developed method, unlabeled probe-based high resolution melting analysis. Methods. A total of 297 SLE patients and 351 controls were recruited. Unlabeled probe-based high resolution melting analysis (HRMA) was used in genotyping. Results. Statistically significant differences were observed in both genotype and allele frequencies for rs6887695 in the SLE patients as compared with the controls. Minor allele (C) of rs6887695 (P = 0.031, OR 0.78, [95% CI 0.63-0.98]) was found to be protective against SLE. The association of SNP rs6887695 with the diagnostic criteria of SLE was also examined. Minor allele (C) exerts protective effect on the incidence of arthritis (P = 0.013, OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.47-0.92) and abnormalities of antinuclear antibody (P = 0.022, OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.49-0.95). IL-12b SNPs were irrelevant to other diagnostic criteria of SLE. Summary. Polymorphisms of rs6887695 in IL-12b gene were associated with disease risk, as well as arthritis and antinuclear antibody synthesis, of systemic lupus erythematosus in Chinese population."
22673349,22673349,Association between thyroid stimulating hormone receptor gene intron polymorphisms and autoimmune thyroid disease in a Chinese Han population.,"Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) is a multifactorial disease with a genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. The thyroid stimulating hormone receptor gene (TSHR) which is expressed on the surface of the thyroid epithelial cell is thought to be the main auto-antigen and a significant candidate for genetic susceptibility to AITD. This case-control study aimed at evaluating the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of TSHR and AITD in a Chinese Han population. We recruited 404 patients with Graves' disease (GD), 230 patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and 242 healthy controls. The Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer (MALDI-TOF-MS) Platform was used to detect five SNPs (rs179247, rs12101255, rs2268475, rs1990595, and rs3783938) in TSHR gene. The frequencies of allele T and TT genotype of rs12101255 in GD patients were significantly increased compared with those of the controls (P=0.004/0.015, OR=1.408/1.446). The allele A frequency of rs3783938 was greater in HT patients than in the controls (P=0.025, OR=1.427). The AT haplotype (rs179247-rs12101255) was associated with an increased risk of GD (P=0.010, OR=1.368). The allele A of rs179247 was associated with ophthalmopathy in GD patients. These data suggest that the polymorphisms of rs12101255 and rs3783938 are associated with GD and HT, respectively."
22699877,22699877,Association between polymorphisms of the CYP11A1 gene and polycystic ovary syndrome in Chinese women.,"The cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1) gene plays an important part in the synthesis of sex hormones and has been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome. A case-control study including 314 PCOS patients and 314 controls was conducted to assess the association of the SNPs rs4077582 and rs11632698 in CYP11A1 with PCOS using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Thereafter, 100 DNA samples were re-genotyped by direct sequencing for confirmation. The genotypic distribution of rs4077582 in women with PCOS differed from that in controls (P = 0.002). No such distributional difference was found in rs11632698 (P = 0.912). Data from our previous study of these two SNPs in another population including 290 PCOS patients and 344 controls was combined with the current data. Combined analysis (a total of 1262 participants, including 604 PCOS patients and 658 control women) showed a much more significant difference in the genotypic distribution of rs4077582 between PCOS and controls (P < 0.001). The T allele was more prevalent in PCOS patients (Odds ratio = 1.314; 95 % CI 1.122-1.540). The testosterone levels among the three genotypes for rs4077582 were different in the control group, as were the LH levels and the LH/FSH ratio. Therefore, SNP rs4077582 in CYP11A1 is strongly associated with susceptibility to PCOS and may alter the testosterone levels by the regulation of LH in different genotypes. No association was observed in rs11632698."

It has been reported that the genetic variation may play a role in the development and severity of COPD. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in interleukin (IL)-12A and IL-12B were associated with COPD in a Chinese population. The IL-12A rs2243115 and IL-12B rs3212227 polymorphisms were genotyped by performing polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 298 patients with COPD and 346 healthy controls. We observed that the frequencies of GT and GT+GG of IL-12A rs2243115 were significantly different from TT in the COPD group and the control group (GT vs. TT: odds ratio [OR]=2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.55-3.57, p<0.001; GT+GG vs. TT: OR=2.46, 95% CI=1.63-3.71, p<0.001). These data suggest that the IL-12A rs2243115 polymorphism may contribute to genetic susceptibility to COPD in a Chinese population."
22662167,22662167,Genetic variation in the EGFR gene and the risk of glioma in a Chinese Han population.,"Previous studies have shown that regulation of the epidermal growth factor gene (EGFR) pathway plays a role in glioma progression. Certain genotypes of the EGFR gene may be related to increased glioblastoma risk, indicating that germ line EGFR polymorphisms may have implications in carcinogenesis. To examine whether and how variants in the EGFR gene contribute to glioma susceptibility, we evaluated nine tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of the EGFR gene in a case-control study from Xi'an city of China (301 cases, 302 controls). EGFR SNP associations analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0 statistical packages, PLINK software, Haploview software package (version 4.2) and SHEsis software platform. We identified two susceptibility tSNPs in the EGFR gene that were potentially associated with an increased risk of glioma (rs730437, p = 0.016; OR: 1.32; 95%CI: 1.05-1.66 and rs1468727, p = 0.008; OR: 1.31; 95%CI: 1.04-1.65). However, after a strict Bonferroni correction analysis was applied, the significance level of the association between EGFR tSNPs and risk of glioma was attenuated. We observed a protective effect of haplotype ""AATT"" of the EGFR gene, which was associated with a 29% reduction in the risk of developing glioma, while haplotype ""CGTC"" increased the risk of developing glioma by 36%. Our results, combined with previous studies, suggested an association between the EGFR gene and glioma development."
22648266,22648266,Genetically elevated levels of circulating triglycerides and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity in a Chinese population.,"Elevated levels of circulating triglycerides and increased arterial stiffness are associated with cardiovascular disease. Numerous studies have reported an association between levels of circulating triglycerides and arterial stiffness. We used Mendelian randomization to test whether this association is causal. We investigated the association between circulating triglyceride levels, the apolipoprotein A-V (ApoA5) -1131T>C single nucleotide polymorphism and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) by examining data from 4421 subjects aged 18-74 years who were recruited from the Chinese population. baPWV was significantly associated with the levels of circulating triglycerides after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, heart rate, waist-to-hip ratio, antihypertensive treatment and diabetes mellitus status. The -1131C allele was associated with a 5% (95% confidence interval 3-8%) increase in circulating triglycerides (adjusted for age, sex, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, diabetes mellitus and antihypertensive treatment). Instrumental variable analysis showed that genetically elevated levels of circulating triglycerides were not associated with increased baPWV. These results do not support the hypothesis that levels of circulating triglycerides have a causal role in the development of arterial stiffness."

22643902,22643902,"SNP identification and allelic-specific PCR markers development for TaGW2, a gene linked to wheat kernel weight.","TaGW2, an orthologous gene of rice OsGW2, has been associated with kernel width and weight of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). Difference in TaGW2 coding sequence was not found among different wheat varieties in previous researches. In this study, we found eight exons and seven introns in TaGW2 with a full-length cDNA sequence of 1,275 bp, which contains a conserved function domain and seven splice sites that shared homology with rice OsGW2. A single T-base insertion in the eighth exon of TaGW2 on chromosome 6A was detected in a large-kernel wheat variety, Lankaodali. This insertion mutation reduces the coding protein sequence from normal 424 amino acids (~47.2 kDa) to 328 amino acids (~37.1 kDa) by truncating 96 amino acids. The result was validated by identifying histidine-tagged TaGW2 proteins encoded by both alleles of the mutant and the wild types in SDS-PAGE. Allele-specific PCR markers were developed based on the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site. The SNP markers were genotyped for an F(2) segregation population from the cross of Lankaodali × Chinese Spring. Seed traits of F(2:3) families were evaluated in three different environments. The association analysis indicated that F(2:3) families with the mutated TaGW2 allele significantly increased kernel width (KW) and thousand-kernel weight (TKW), and slightly improved kernel length (KL). Using the SNP markers, another two varieties harbored the mutated TaGW2 allele were successfully identified from 22 additional wheat varieties, and they both have large KW and TKW. Cloning and sequencing of the gene further confirmed the functions of the mutated allele of TaGW2 in the two large kernel varieties. The results suggested that TaGW2 may negatively regulate kernel size variation, which shares the same function as OsGW2 in rice. The successful development of SNP markers provides a useful tool for improving kernel yield in wheat."

The present study was designed to investigate the potential relationship between E-selectin gene polymorphisms and ischemic stroke in a Chinese Han population. Three hundred fourteen ischemic stroke patients and 389 unrelated healthy controls were recruited for the study. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)-rs1805193(G98T), rs5361(A561C), and rs5355(C1839T)-in the exon region of the E-selectin gene, were genotyped using a Multiplex SNaPshot sequencing assay. The data showed that the genotype and allele frequencies of G98T and C1839T SNP were similar in both ischemic stroke patients and the controls. In contrast, the frequency of both the AC genotype and the C allele of A561C was significantly higher in ischemic stroke patients than in healthy controls (P = 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). After adjusting for other risk factors (such as hypertension, diabetes, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption), the E-selectin gene AC genotype and C allele of A561C were still associated with a risk of ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR] = 2.73, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.29-5.76, P = 0.008; OR = 2.80, 95% CI: 1.58-4.94, P < 0.001, respectively).

We studied the association of the PCSK1 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6235 (encoding an S690T substitution) with essential hypertension (EH), obesity and related traits in the Han Chinese population. The rs6235 SNP in the PCSK1 gene was investigated using a case-control study design, with 1034 hypertension cases and 1112 normotensive controls. In this study, the rs6235 SNP was significantly associated with hypertension (OR=1.26, 95% CI (1.10-1.46), P=0.001); the odds ratios of GC vs GG and CC vs GG were 1.30 (95% CI (1.06-1.58), P=0.010) and 1.55 (95% CI (1.12-2.13), P=0.007), respectively. In the controls, the C-allele was associated with increased systolic (P=0.010) and diastolic (P=0.010) blood pressure levels. In all of the EH patients and EH patients without a history of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system-related antagonists, the C-allele was associated with increased plasma renin activity (P=0.00004 and 0.002, respectively) and aldosterone levels (P=0.018 and 0.005, respectively). The C-allele was also associated with increased body mass index (BMI) (P=0.010) in the normotensive controls. In conclusion, the PCSK1 SNP rs6235 was associated with EH and blood pressure in the Han Chinese population, and this association may be mediated by the SNP's effect on RAA levels. rs6235 was also associated with BMI in this population."
22606018,22606018,Risk-association of CYP11A1 polymorphisms and breast cancer among Han Chinese women in Southern China.,"Exposure to endogenous sex hormones has been reported as a risk factor for breast cancer. The CYP11A1 gene encodes the key enzyme that catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step in steroid hormone synthesis. In this study, the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP11A1 and breast cancer susceptibility were examined. Six SNPs in CYP11A1 were genotyped using the MassARRAY IPLEX platform in 530 breast cancer patients and 546 healthy controls. Association analyses based on a χ(2) test and binary logistic regression were performed to determine the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each SNP. Two loci (rs2959008 and rs2279357) showed evidence of associations with breast cancer risk. The variant genotype C/T-C/C of rs2959008 was significantly associated with a decreased risk (age-adjusted OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58-0.96; P = 0.023) compared with the wild-type TT. However, the homozygous TT variant of rs2279357 exhibited increased susceptibility to breast cancer (age-adjusted OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.05-1.98; P = 0.022). The locus rs2959003 also showed an appreciable effect, but no associations were observed for three other SNPs. Our results suggest that polymorphisms of CYP11A1 are related to breast cancer susceptibility in Han Chinese women of South China."
22576021,22576021,Association study of a common variant near IRS1 with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Chinese Han population.,"The insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) plays an important role in insulin signaling. A recent genome-wide association study identified rs2943641C>T as a susceptibility locus for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Caucasian patients. Therefore, we determined whether this common variant near IRS1 is also associated with the risk of T2DM and T2DM-related phenotypes in a Chinese Han population. A total of 2,290 unrelated Chinese Han individuals residing in Beijing were recruited in this study, including 1177 T2DM patients and 1113 subjects with normal glucose tolerance (control group). The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was genotyped using a MassARRAY iPLEX system. The frequency of risk allele C was 0.929 in the control group and 0.939 in patients with T2DM. We found no association between the C allele of rs2943641 and T2DM in a recessive model [OR 1.14, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.89-1.45, P = 0.298], or after adjusting for sex, age, and body mass index (BMI) (OR 1.10, 95 % CI 0.85-1.43, P = 0.301). Analysis of the clinical features of the control subjects with normal glucose tolerance revealed that the 30-min plasma glucose level during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was significantly different between the CC and CT+TT genotypes (P = 0.017). Linear regression analysis showed that the 30-min plasma glucose levels was significantly and positively associated with the CC genotype after adjusting for sex, age, and BMI (β = 0.065, 95 % CI 0.009-0.654, P = 0.044). In addition, a potential association between this SNP and increased waist circumference (β = 1.337, 95 % CI -0.179 to 2.853, P = 0.084) was observed with adjustment for the sex and age. Our study was not able to demonstrate the association between rs2943641 near IRS1 and T2DM in a Chinese Han population. However, this SNP may be associated with postprandial hyperglycemia."

22575062,22575062,Association of Parkinson's disease with six single nucleotide polymorphisms located in four PARK genes in the northern Han Chinese population.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) has widely been reported to be associated with mutations in the PARK genes. To investigate potential genetic risk factors for PD in a northern Han Chinese population, six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (R366W, V380L, P196S, R1628P, G2385R and R461W) located in four PARK genes were multiplex-amplified in two independent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) were subsequently genotyped with Hae III endonuclease digestion in samples from 202 patients with PD and 212 control participants. High-throughput, multiplexed PCR-RFLP assays were able to accurately identify all six SNP. The genotypic frequency of G2385R in PARK8 was significantly different between the patient and control groups; however, the remaining SNP were not associated with PD. No heterogeneity was observed in the R461W site, and only one P196S site was found in the patient group. The polymorphic sites R366W and V380L and R1628P and G2385R were not in linkage disequilibrium. Carriers of 2385R presented at a higher Hoehn-Yahr stage compared to non-carriers. This study demonstrated an association of the G2385R allele with risk for PD in a northern Han Chinese population."
22640896,22640896,Effect of SOX10 gene polymorphism on early onset schizophrenia in Chinese Han population.,"Schizophrenia is one of highly heritable psychiatric disorders. Patients with early onset schizophrenia tend to have a greater genetic loading and may be an attractive subpopulation for genetics studies. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs139887 in sex-determining region Y-box 10 (SOX10), a candidate gene for schizophrenia, was suggested to be associated with schizophrenia although inconsistent results had been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between SOX10 rs139887 polymorphism and schizophrenia using an early onset sample in the Chinese Han population. A total of 321 schizophrenic patients with onset before age 18 and 400 healthy controls were recruited for association study. In addition, two populations involved in three studies were selected for meta-analysis to determine the effect of rs139887 on schizophrenia. Our association study results showed that the allele and genotype frequencies were significantly different between schizophrenic patients and controls (P=0.013 and P=0.034, respectively). Interestingly, a significant association in allele and genotype frequencies were found in male patients (P=0.017 and P=0.045, respectively), but not female patients. Moreover, the C/C genotype had a significant association with an earlier age of onset in male schizophrenic patients (Kaplan-Meier log-rank test P=0.029), but not in female patients (Kaplan-Meier log-rank test P=0.876). The meta-analysis result showed the same C allele was significantly associated with schizophrenia (P=0.007). In conclusion, the SOX10 rs139887 polymorphism was related to the development of schizophrenia in a gender-specific manner, and may be a significant genetic marker for managing subgroups and etiological clues in schizophrenia."
22634065,22634065,Genetic association analysis of ERBB4 polymorphisms with the risk of schizophrenia and SPEM abnormality in a Korean population.,"The human receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-4 (ERBB4) gene mediates neuregulin 1 (NRG1) signaling, and is involved in neuronal migration and differentiation. Despite the potential significance of ERBB4 in the development of schizophrenia, relatively few genetic studies for the association of ERBB4 with schizophrenia were performed in the populations including Ashkenazi Jews, Americans including Caucasians and African Americans, and Han Chinese. In this study, differences in ERBB4 variations were investigated to determine association with schizophrenia and smooth pursuit eye movement (SPEM) abnormality in a Korean population. Seven polymorphisms in ERBB4 gene were genotyped in 435 schizophrenia cases and 390 unrelated healthy controls. In order to investigate the relationship between ERBB4 and the risk of schizophrenia and SPEM abnormality, differences in SNP and haplotype distribution were analyzed using logistic and multiple regression analyses. However, we failed to replicate the associations reported by previous studies in other populations. Although statistically not significant, the tendency towards associations between ERBB4 polymorphisms and the risk of schizophrenia and SPEM abnormality in this study from a Korean population would be helpful for further genetic etiology studies in schizophrenia."
22548711,22548711,Association of BDNF gene polymorphism with bipolar disorders in Han Chinese population.,"Recent data suggest that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an essential role in neuronal plasticity and etiology of bipolar disorders (BPD). However, results from different studies have been inconsistent. In present study, 342 patients who met DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition) criteria for bipolar disorders type I (BPD-I) or type II (BPD-II) and 386 matched health controls were enrolled, and TaqMan(®) SNP Genotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) were applied to detect the functional polymorphism rs6265 (Val66Met) of BDNF gene. Treatment response to lithium and valproate was retrospectively determined. The association between Val66Met polymorphism and BPD, treatment response to mood stabilizers, was estimated. The genotype and allele distribution of Val66Met polymorphism between BPD patients and control subjects showed significant difference (genotype: χ(2) = 6.18, df = 2, P = 0.046; allele: χ(2) = 5.01, df = 1, P = 0.025) with Met allele as risk factor for disease susceptibility (OR = 0.79, 95%CI as 0.64-0.97). The post hoc analysis interestingly showed that Met allele had opposite effect on the treatment response for BPD-I and BPD-II separately. For BPD-I patients, the response score in Val/Val group was significantly lower than that in Met allele carriers (t = -2.27, df = 144, P = 0.025); for BPD-II patients, the response score in Val/Val group was significantly higher than that in Met allele carriers (t = 2.33, df = 26, P = 0.028). Although these results should be interpreted with caution because of the limited sample for Val/Val genotype in BPD-II patients (N = 5), these findings strengthen the hypothesis that BDNF pathway gets involved in the etiology and pharmacology of BPD and suggest the differences between BPD-I and BPD-II."

22551939,22551939,Association of a functional single-nucleotide polymorphism in the ALDH2 gene with essential hypertension depends on drinking behavior in a Chinese Han population.,"Alcohol consumption is an important environmental factor in the development of essential hypertension (EH) and cardiovascular disease. Several epidemiological studies have investigated the association between hypertension and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) genotype, although the results are inconsistent. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible effect of drinking behavior on the ALDH2-EH relationship in a Chinese Han population. A total of 1098 unrelated individuals with EH and 1021 controls of Chinese Han ethnicity were included. We evaluated the effect of three tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms on blood pressure (BP) and serum lipid level by blood chemical assays. The major findings were that rs671 guanine/adenine genotype (odds ratio (OR)=0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.28-0.74) and A allele (OR=0.55, 95% CI: 0.36-0.85) were associated with a decreased risk of EH in drinkers. In addition, the rs671 genotype influenced BP, triglyceride (TG) level and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level in the same drinking-dependent pattern. Drinkers who carried the A allele displayed lower systolic BP (β=-0.16, P=0.001) and TG level (β=-0.14, P=0.004) and higher HDL-C level (β=0.11, P=0.019), but this association was not observed in nondrinkers. In summary, we present evidence for the association of rs671 in the ALDH2 gene with susceptibility to EH, increase in BP and disturbance of serum lipid profiles in drinkers, but not in nondrinkers. Further functional research is warranted to elucidate the role of rs671 in the variation of BP and lipid levels in EH."
22522387,22522387,Association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosome 1p22 and 20q12 and nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate: new data in Han Chinese and meta-analysis.,"Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) is a common congenital malformation associated with genetic and environmental risk factors. A recent genome-wide association study identified two novel susceptibility loci on chromosomes 1p22 and 20q12; however, conflicting results, especially for 1p22, have been reported in Han Chinese population. The aims of this study were to replicate this association with risk of NSCL/P in the southern Han Chinese population and to discern the effect of these loci by a meta-analysis."
22543033,22543033,Relationship between HLA-DP gene polymorphisms and clearance of chronic hepatitis B virus infections: case-control study and meta-analysis.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious public health problem worldwide. Two common genetic variants (rs3077 and rs9277535) of human leukocyte antigen DP (HLA-DP) have been reported to be associated with persistent HBV infection in populations of Japan and Thailand. To confirm whether the association can be replicated in Chinese populations, an independent case-control study were conducted, and two polymorphisms (rs3077 and rs9277535) were genotyped using the TaqMan SNP genotyping assay in 282 persistent chronic HBV carriers and 64 spontaneously HBV recovered carriers. To provide a more definitive conclusion, a meta-analysis combining and summarizing five studies was performed by random-effects model using the DerSimonian and Laird's method. By using logistic regression analysis with adjustment for covariates, including age, sex, and alcohol consumption, the results of our independent case-control study showed that the minor allele's homozygote (AA genotype) of rs3077 and rs9277535 was significantly associated with decreasing risk/protection of HBV persistent chronic infection (for rs3077: P=0.0017, OR=0.29, 95% CI=0.13-0.62; for rs9277535, P=0.0004, OR=0.26, 95% CI=0.12-0.54). The results of meta-analysis pooling all eligible studies also showed that rs3077-A and rs9277535-A alleles were associated with an increased clearance rate to HBV infection (rs3077: OR=0.57, 95% CI=0.44-0.75; rs9277535: OR=0.56, 95% CI=0.47-0.63). These results further confirmed the strong influence of HLA-DP gene variants on risk of spontaneous HBV clearance from persistent HBV infection. Both A alleles of HLA-DP SNP rs3077 and rs9277535 showed strong protective effects for spontaneous HBV clearance from persistent HBV infection in the Han Chinese population."

22520855,22520855,Association study of a new schizophrenia susceptibility locus of 10q24.32-33 in a Han Chinese population.,"Recently, a new schizophrenia susceptibility locus 10q24.32-q24.33, containing two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs: rs7914558 and rs11191580), was identified in a genome-wide association study. To examine if this locus is associated with schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population, we analyzed six SNPs, including two SNPs within the region of interest. The sample consisted of 1430 schizophrenia cases and 1570 controls from genetically independent members of the Han population. Single-SNP association, haplotype association and sex-specific association analyses were performed. Three SNPs, rs7914558 (p=1.41×10(-4); OR=1.11; 95% CI 1.05-1.17), rs12220375 (p=1.18×10(-4); OR=1.06; 95% CI 1.03-1.09) and rs11191580 (p=3.03×10(-4); OR=1.05; 95% CI 1.02-1.10), mapped to the locus and were significantly associated in our sample set. Further genotype and haplotype association analyses suggested a similar pattern. Similar to results from European populations, our results provide further evidence that this region associated with schizophrenia in Han Chinese. Results also confirm previous reports suggesting that 10q24.32-q24.33 offers an intriguing new insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and may play an important role in its etiology."

22489574,22489574,Association of c-Jun gene polymorphism with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus in a Chinese population.,"C-Jun has been proved as playing an important role in the pathogenesis of tumors, as a main component of Activator protein 1 and c-Jun gene polymorphisms are associated with colorectal cancer. However, the relationship between the c-Jun gene polymorphism and the susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has not been known. Our purpose is to evaluate whether the c-Jun gene polymorphism (SNP rs3748814) is associated with susceptibility to SLE in a Chinese population. In this study, we enrolled 502 SLE patients and 652 healthy controls. The c-Jun polymorphism (rs3748814) was specified from genomic DNA using the TaqMan genotyping assay on a 7300 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction system. We found that the frequency of the A/G genotype in SLE patients was lower than in healthy controls, whereas the frequency of the G/G genotype was significantly higher in SLE patients than in healthy controls (A/G vs. G/G p = 8.670e-08, odds ratio [OR] = 0.290, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.184-0.456). In addition, the frequency of allele A in the patients group was significantly lower than in the control group (A vs. G p=5.221e-09, OR = 0.308, 95% CI = 0.212-0.466). The distribution of genotype and allele frequency in SLE patients with lupus nephritis (LN) compared with SLE patients without LN was not statistically significant (A/G vs. G/G p = 0.744, OR = 1.157, 95% CI=0.481-2.785; A vs. G p = 0.748, OR = 1.152, 95% CI = 0.486-2.734; A/A+A/G vs. G/G p = 0.744, OR = 1.157, 95% CI = 0.481-2.785). Furthermore, we did not find any significant association between other clinical features and genotypes.

22476228,22476228,Association between genetic variants of the ADD1 and GNB3 genes and blood pressure response to the cold pressor test in a Chinese Han population: the GenSalt Study.,"Genetic factors influence blood pressure (BP) response to the cold pressor test (CPT), which is a phenotype related to hypertension risk. We examined the association between variants of the α-adducin (ADD1) and guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein) β-polypeptide 3 (GNB3) genes and BP response to the CPT. A total of 1998 Han Chinese participants from the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Salt Sensitivity completed the CPT. The area under the curve (AUC) above the baseline BP during the CPT was used to measure the BP response. Twelve single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ADD1 and GNB3 genes were selected and genotyped. Both single-marker and haplotype association analyses were conducted using linear mixed models. The rs17833172 and rs3775067 SNPs of the ADD1 gene and the rs4963516 SNP of the GNB3 gene were significantly associated with the BP response to CPT, even after adjusting for multiple testing. For the ADD1 gene, the AA genotype of SNP rs17833172 was associated with lower systolic BP (SBP) reactivity (P<0.0001) and faster BP recovery (P=0.0003). The TT genotype of rs3775067 was associated with slower SBP recovery (P=0.004). For the GNB3 gene, the C allele of SNP rs4963516 was associated with faster diastolic BP recovery (P=0.002) and smaller overall AUC (P=0.003). Haplotype analysis indicated that the CCGC haplotype of ADD1 constructed by rs1263359, rs3775067, rs4961 and rs4963 was significantly associated with the BP response to CPT. These data suggest that genetic variants of the ADD1 and GNB3 genes may have important roles in BP response to the CPT. Future studies aimed at replicating these novel findings are warranted."

We enrolled 190 histologically diagnosed gliomas and 210 healthy controls in this study. Two genetic variants at galectin-3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites (galectin-3 +191 A>C and +292 A>C) were determined. We found that the A/A genotype at galectin-3 gene +292 A>C was significantly more prevalent in gliomas patient than in controls (42.1% vs. 29.0%, P=0.021); the A allele frequency was markedly higher in gliomas subjects than in controls (61.8% vs. 45.0%, P=0.008). There was a markedly higher prevalence of AA carriers in high-grade subgroup than in low-grade subgroup (50.5% vs. 31.8%, P=0.012). The Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that the gliomas patients carrying AA genotype of galectin-3 gene +292 A>C had marked shorter overall survival period than those did not (AA vs. AC+CC, 22.2±3.8 months vs. 38.3 months±7.9; P=0.04). The SNPs at +191 A>C of galectin-3 gene did not show positive association with clinico-pathological characteristics and prognosis of gliomas. The results of this study suggest the SNPs at +292 A>C, not SNPs at +191 A>C, of galectin-3 gene were associated with the tumor grade and prognosis of gliomas."

22479346,22479346,"Identification of IGF1, SLC4A4, WWOX, and SFMBT1 as hypertension susceptibility genes in Han Chinese with a genome-wide gene-based association study.","Hypertension is a complex disorder with high prevalence rates all over the world. We conducted the first genome-wide gene-based association scan for hypertension in a Han Chinese population. By analyzing genome-wide single-nucleotide-polymorphism data of 400 matched pairs of young-onset hypertensive patients and normotensive controls genotyped with the Illumina HumanHap550-Duo BeadChip, 100 susceptibility genes for hypertension were identified and also validated with permutation tests. Seventeen of the 100 genes exhibited differential allelic and expression distributions between patient and control groups. These genes provided a good molecular signature for classifying hypertensive patients and normotensive controls. Among the 17 genes, IGF1, SLC4A4, WWOX, and SFMBT1 were not only identified by our gene-based association scan and gene expression analysis but were also replicated by a gene-based association analysis of the Hong Kong Hypertension Study. Moreover, cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci associated with the differentially expressed genes were found and linked to hypertension. IGF1, which encodes insulin-like growth factor 1, is associated with cardiovascular disorders, metabolic syndrome, decreased body weight/size, and changes of insulin levels in mice. SLC4A4, which encodes the electrogenic sodium bicarbonate cotransporter 1, is associated with decreased body weight/size and abnormal ion homeostasis in mice. WWOX, which encodes the WW domain-containing protein, is related to hypoglycemia and hyperphosphatemia. SFMBT1, which encodes the scm-like with four MBT domains protein 1, is a novel hypertension gene. GRB14, TMEM56 and KIAA1797 exhibited highly significant differential allelic and expressed distributions between hypertensive patients and normotensive controls. GRB14 was also found relevant to blood pressure in a previous genetic association study in East Asian populations. TMEM56 and KIAA1797 may be specific to Taiwanese populations, because they were not validated by the two replication studies. Identification of these genes enriches the collection of hypertension susceptibility genes, thereby shedding light on the etiology of hypertension in Han Chinese populations."
22437209,22437209,Genetic variants on chromosome 6p21.1 and 6p22.3 are associated with type 2 diabetes risk: a case-control study in Han Chinese.,"Recent genome-wide association studies have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 6p21.1 and 6p22.3 as type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility loci in the European and Japanese populations. However, these SNPs have not been well evaluated in Chinese population. Here, we performed a case-control study with 2925 T2D cases and 3281 controls in a Chinese population. We used TaqMan OpenArray and Sequenom MassARRAY to genotype the four SNPs (rs4712523, rs7756992, rs4712524 and rs6931514) in CDKAL1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1-like 1) at 6p22.3 and one SNP (rs9472138) near vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) at 6p21.1. All the five SNPs were significantly associated with T2D risk with overall effects (odds ratio, OR) from 1.19 to 1.29 in the additive genetic model (rs6931514: OR=1.29, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI)=1.19-1.39, P=5.6 × 10(-10); rs7756992: OR=1.23, 95% CI=1.15-1.32, P=1.2 × 10(-8); rs4712523: OR=1.25, 95% CI=1.15-1.35, P=3.8 × 10(-8); rs4712524: OR=1.24, 95% CI=1.15-1.35, P=6.8 × 10(-8); rs9472138: OR=1.19, 95% CI=1.05-1.34, P=006). Conditional analysis identified two independent signals (rs6931514 at 6p22.3 and rs9472138 at 6p21.1) that were significantly associated with T2D. Compared with the wild homozygote of rs6931514 and rs9472138, subjects with variant alleles of the two SNPs had increased risk for T2D susceptibility in a dose-response manner (P(trend)=7.4 × 10(-12)). Our findings indicated that genetic variants of CDKAL1 and VEGFA on chromosome 6 may contribute to T2D risk in Chinese population, especially for rs9472138 at 6p21.1 identified for the first time to significantly increase the T2D risk in Chinese individuals."

Furthermore, GWAS-identified loci were primarily identified in women of European descent."
22447624,22447624,BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is associated with Stage III-IV endometriosis and poor in vitro fertilization outcome.,"BACKGROUND The recently identified human brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism was found to be associated with altered susceptibility to some neuropsychiatric disorders. Interestingly, BDNF together with its receptors TrkB and p75 are extensively expressed in female reproduction system. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism plays a role in endometriosis, endometriosis-related infertility and the outcomes of IVF and embryo transfer (IVF-ET).  METHODS A case-control study included 425 endometriosis patients and 244 control Chinese Han women. The genotyping of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was performed by the fluorescence resonance energy transfer method. The plasma and follicular fluid concentrations of BDNF on the day of oocyte retrieval were measured by ELISA. The general clinical data from the endometriosis-related and tubal obstructed infertile patients treated with IVF-ET were analyzed.  RESULTS There was no association between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and overall endometriosis (P> 0.05), whereas higher genotype and allele frequencies of the BDNF(Met) polymorphism were found in the Stage III-IV endometriosis (both P< 0.01) and endometriosis-related infertile patients (both P< 0.05). Moreover, during IVF and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) treatment, fewer mature oocytes (P< 0.05) and lower fertilization rate (P< 0.01) were found in BDNF(Met/Met) carriers compared with those in BDNF(Val/Val) carriers with infertility. Follicular-fluid BDNF concentration in BDNF(Met/Met) carriers was lower compared with that in BDNF(Val/Val) individuals (P< 0.01).  CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that the BDNF(Met) single-nucleotide polymorphism might contribute to the increased susceptibility to the Stage III-IV endometriosis and endometriosis-related infertility. Moreover, infertile patients with the BDNF(Met/Met) genotype had a poorer IVF outcome compared with the BDNF(Val/Val) genotype individuals, which might in part be due to the decreased BDNF levels in follicular fluids after controlled ovarian hyperstimulation."

22421804,22421804,Genetic association of SLC2A14 polymorphism with Alzheimer's disease in a Han Chinese population.,"Glucose uptake and metabolism are impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, which appear to be a cause, rather than a consequence of neurodegeneration. Recently, the gene of the 14th isoform of subfamily A of solute carrier family 2 (SLC2A14), encoding glucose transporter 14 (GLUT14), was identified for the association in vivo with AD pathology of Tau, and rs10845990 within SLC2A14 showed association with AD in Caucasians. In order to evaluate the involvement of the SLC2A14 polymorphism in the risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in Chinese, we performed an independent case-control association study in a Han Chinese population (597 LOAD cases and 605 healthy controls). There were significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies between LOAD cases and controls (genotype P = 0.015, allele P = 0.039). The G-carrying genotype (GT + GG) individuals showed a 1.41-fold increased risk compared with the TT genotype carriers (odds ratio (OR) = 1.41, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.11-1.79, P = 0.005, Power = 83.6 %). After stratification by ApoE ε4-carrying status, rs10845990 polymorphism was only significantly associated with LOAD in non-ApoE ε4 allele carriers (P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis also conferred this positive association between the SNP rs10845990 and LOAD in the dominant and additive model after adjustment for age, gender, and the ApoE ε4 carrier status. These results suggested that SLC2A14 polymorphism has a possible role in changing the genetic susceptibility to LOAD in a Han Chinese population."
22425949,22425949,[A family-based association study of the EGR3 gene polymorphisms and schizophrenia].,"Previous studies showed that EGR3 gene located in chromosome 8p21.3 was involved in the etiology of schizophrenia. However, the finding failed to be replicated in several case-control studies. To investigate the genetic role of the EGR3 gene in Chinese psychiatric patients, we genotyped five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in EGR3 gene locus using 93 nuclear families in Han Chinese, and performed transmission disequilibrium test (TDT). In this study, two SNPs (rs1996147 and rs3750192) showed significant association with schizophrenia (c2>4.40, P<0.05). In the linkage disequilibrium analysis, the significant association was also found in two- (rs3750192-rs35201266), three- (rs1877670- rs3750192-rs7009708) and four-SNP (rs1996147-rs1877670-rs3750192-rs7009708) tests of haplotype analyses (c2>7.10, global P<0.05). Overall, the results suggested that EGR3 gene may play an important role in schizophrenia susceptibility in the Han Chinese population, and further functional exploration of the EGR3 gene will contribute to the underlying molecular mechanism for schizophrenia pathogenesis."

We hypothesized that miRNA-196a2 polymorphism is associated with the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) in a Chinese population. In a case-control study of 549 PD patients and 736 control subjects frequency matched by age and gender, we genotyped the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11614913 (T>C) in miRNA-196a2, whose target mRNA was alpha-synuclein, and assessed its association with risk of PD by TaqMan Genotyping method. No association was found for the miR-196a2 rs11614913 CT/CC genotype (odds ratio (OR), 0.879, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.681-1.135 for CT genotype; OR, 1.085, 95% CI, 0.793-1.484 for CC genotype) with risk of PD, compared with the TT genotype.

22405623,22405623,Mutation analysis of the NRXN1 gene in a Chinese autism cohort.,"Autism is a brain developmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors. The neurexin-1(NRXN1) gene mapped on chromosome 2p16.3 encodes neurexin, a cell adhesion molecule and receptor in the vertebrate nervous system. Rare de novo alterations and copy number variations (CNVs) suggested neurexin-1 as a candidate gene for the pathogenesis of autism, but data on the gene mutation of neurexin-1 in Chinese Han population with autism are limited. By direct sequencing, we analyzed the entire coding regions and associated splice junctions of neurexin-1 in 313 Chinese autism patients. For exons in which non-synonymous variants were identified, sequencing was performed in 500 healthy controls. We identified 22 variants in the neurexin-1 coding regions, including 7 missense variants, 3 deletions, and 12 synonymous mutations. Among them, 3 missense and 3 synonymous variants were not reported in the dbSNP database and absent in 500 control subjects; whereas 4 missense variants, 3 deletions and 3 synonymous mutations were not reported in the dbSNP database but were identified in the control subjects. However, there is no significant association of these mutations with autism risk. Interestingly, there was a statistically significant association of neurexin-1 SNP P300P (rs2303298) with risk of autism (26.2% vs. 13.8%; χ(2) = 22.487; p = 3.45E-006; OR = 2.152 (1.559-2.970)). Our data suggest a possible association of neurexin-1 with autism risk in Chinese Han population, warranting further large-scale study on this gene."

22382309,22382309,The prevalence of CD33 and MS4A6A variant in Chinese Han population with Alzheimer's disease.,"CD33 and MS4A6A genes play potential key roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One recent genome-wide association study has revealed that the rs3865444 polymorphism in the CD33 gene and rs610932 polymorphism in the MS4A6A gene are associated with susceptibility to AD in Caucasians. To evaluate the relationship between the polymorphism of the CD33, MS4A6A gene and AD in the ethnic Chinese Han, we conducted a case-control study (n = 383, age > 54) to determine the prevalence of single-nucleotide polymorphism of two genes in patients with AD in Chinese population of Mainland, and clarified whether these polymorphisms are risk factors for AD. The prevalence of the allele (T) in the rs3865444 polymorphism of the CD33 gene and allele (C) in rs610932 polymorphism of the MS4A6A gene was significantly different in AD patients and control subjects (P < 0.001, respectively), and the results were not influenced by age, gender, or APOE status. Our data revealed the allele (T) of the rs3865444 polymorphism of the CD33 gene and the allele (C) of the rs610932 polymorphism of the MS4A6A gene may contribute to AD risk in the Chinese Han population."

This study investigated the association between common variants in the fibrinogen gene and the risk of developing sporadic cerebral hemorrhage (CH). We performed genotyping analyses for three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the fibrinogen gene in a case-controlled study involving 195 patients with CH and 116 control participants; both groups were of southern Han-Chinese origin. Logistic regression analysis indicated that haplotypes ATA (rs1800790+rs1800787+rs6050), AA (rs1800790+rs6050) and TA (rs1800787+rs6050) could nearly double the risk of sporadic CH (odds ratio [OR]=1.738, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.103-2.740, p=0.017; adjusted OR=1.762, 95% CI: 1.042-2.982, p=0.035), although the three SNP were not associated with sporadic CH when analyzed separately. These findings indicate that rs1800790, rs1800787 and rs6050 polymorphisms may contribute to the etiology of sporadic CH in the Chinese population."
22378357,22378357,Genome wide linkage disequilibrium in Chinese asparagus bean (Vigna. unguiculata ssp. sesquipedialis) germplasm: implications for domestication history and genome wide association studies.,"Association mapping of important traits of crop plants relies on first understanding the extent and patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the particular germplasm being investigated. We characterize here the genetic diversity, population structure and genome wide LD patterns in a set of asparagus bean (Vigna. unguiculata ssp. sesquipedialis) germplasm from China. A diverse collection of 99 asparagus bean and normal cowpea accessions were genotyped with 1127 expressed sequence tag-derived single nucleotide polymorphism markers (SNPs). The proportion of polymorphic SNPs across the collection was relatively low (39%), with an average number of SNPs per locus of 1.33. Bayesian population structure analysis indicated two subdivisions within the collection sampled that generally represented the 'standard vegetable' type (subgroup SV) and the 'non-standard vegetable' type (subgroup NSV), respectively. Level of LD (r(2)) was higher and extent of LD persisted longer in subgroup SV than in subgroup NSV, whereas LD decayed rapidly (0-2 cM) in both subgroups. LD decay distance varied among chromosomes, with the longest (≈ 5 cM) five times longer than the shortest (≈ 1 cM). Partitioning of LD variance into within- and between-subgroup components coupled with comparative LD decay analysis suggested that linkage group 5, 7 and 10 may have undergone the most intensive epistatic selection toward traits favorable for vegetable use. This work provides a first population genetic insight into domestication history of asparagus bean and demonstrates the feasibility of mapping complex traits by genome wide association study in asparagus bean using a currently available cowpea SNPs marker platform."
22367966,22367966,Genome-wide association study identifies novel loci associated with serum level of vitamin B12 in Chinese men.,"Vitamin B12 (VitB12 or cobalamin) is an essential cofactor in several metabolic pathways. Clinically, VitB12 deficiency is associated with pernicious anemia, neurodegenerative disorder, cardiovascular disease and gastrointestinal disease. Although previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified several genes, including FUT2, CUBN, TCN1 and MUT, that may influence VitB12 levels in European populations, common genetic determinants of VitB12 remain largely unknown, especially in Asian populations. Here we performed a GWAS in 1999 healthy Chinese men and replicated the top findings in an independent Chinese sample with 1496 subjects. We identified four novel genomic loci that were significantly associated with serum level of VitB12 at a genome-wide significance level of 5.00 × 10(-8). These four loci were MS4A3 (11q12.1; rs2298585; P= 2.64 × 10(-15)), CLYBL (13q32; rs41281112; P= 9.23 × 10(-10)), FUT6 (19p13.3; rs3760776; P= 3.68 × 10(-13)) and 5q32 region (rs10515552; P= 3.94 × 10(-8)). In addition, we also confirmed the association with the serum level of VitB12 for the previously reported FUT2 gene and identified one novel non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism in FUT2 gene in this Chinese population (19q13.33; rs1047781; P= 3.62 × 10(-36)). The new loci identified offer new insights into the biochemical pathways involved in determining the serum level of VitB12 and provide opportunities to better delineate the role of VitB12 in health and disease."

22361738,22361738,Single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2290692 in the 3'UTR of ITPKC associated with susceptibility to Kawasaki disease in a Han Chinese population.,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is characterized by acute systemic vasculitis and frequently is complicated by coronary artery lesions (CALs). The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase C (ITPKC) gene rs28493229 was recently found to be associated with the risk for KD in the Japanese population, suggesting that the ITPKC gene may contribute to KD susceptibility. This study investigated the association of ITPKC polymorphisms with KD in a Han Chinese population. Five ITPKC Single-nucleotide polymorphisms, including rs28493229, were genotyped in 223 unrelated patients who had KD and 318 non-KD control subjects. The allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies were compared between the patients and the control subjects, between the patients with and those without CALs, and between patients resistant to intravenous immunoglobulin treatment and those responsive to such treatment. Multiple alleles were observed for rs28493229 and rs2290692. No significant differences in the frequencies of the C allele, the CC genotype, or the C carriers of rs28493229 were observed in the comparisons. Interestingly, significantly higher frequencies of the C allele (p < 0.001), the CC genotype (p = 0.001), and the C carriers (p = 0.003) were observed for rs2290692 among the patients than among the control subjects, and similar differences were observed between the patients with and those without CALs. The GC haplotype for rs28493229 and rs2290692 was more common among the patients than among the control subjects. The results indicate that the C allele of the ITPKC gene rs2290692 is linked to a significantly higher risk for KD in the studied population, which provides new evidence to support the importance of the ITPKC gene in the occurrence of KD. More notably, this finding suggests that there may be an unidentified ITPKC polymorphism in strong linkage disequilibrium to rs2290692, significantly affecting susceptibility to KD in the Han population."

27625800,27625800,Lack of association between NCAM1 and early onset schizophrenia in a family based study in Shandong peninsula of China.,"The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM1) gene plays important roles in cellular migration, synaptic integrity and neurodevelopment. Multiple NCAM1 proteins are differentially altered in schizophrenia (SZ). A whole genome association study was first carried out on Affymetrix genome-wide human single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) Array 6.0 and two pooled DNA samples consisting of 89 early onset SZ (EOS) cases and 1,000 controls. Association between rs10891495 and EOS was detected (χ(2) = 2 3.66, P = 1.15E-06). The position of this SNP is just within the NCAM1 gene. Since several previous studies reported that NCAM1 was a candidate gene for SZ, we further performed a family based association study and genotyped six SNPs (rs10891495, rs1245133, rs1821693, rs686050, rs12794326, rs674246) within NCAM1 gene in 100 EOS nuclear families. We found no evidence for association with SZ status either for SNP or for haplotype. Therefore, the NCAM1 gene is unlikely to play a major role in the etiology of early-onset SZ in the Chinese population."
22370887,22370887,Are bone mineral density loci  associated with hip osteoporotic fractures? A validation study on previously  reported genome-wide association loci in a Chinese population.,"Osteoporosis  is a heritable disease characterized mainly by low bone mineral density (BMD)  and/or osteoporotic fractures (OF). Most genome-wide association studies on  osteoporosis have focused on BMD, whereas little effort has been expended to  identify genetic variants directly linked to OF. To determine whether BMD-loci  are also associated with OF risk, we performed a validation study to examine 23  BMD-loci reported by recent genome-wide association studies for association  with hip OF risk. Our sample consisted of 700 elderly Chinese Han subjects, 350  with hip OF and 350 healthy matched controls. We identified four BMD-loci that  were significantly associated with hip OF in this Chinese population, including  7q21 (FLJ42280, P = 1.17 × 10(-4) for rs4729260; P =  0.008 for rs7781370), 6p21 (MHC, P = 0.004 for rs3130340), 13q14 (TNFSF11,  P = 0.012 for rs9533090; P = 0.018 for rs9594759; P = 0.020 for rs9594738; P =  0.044 for rs9594751), and 18q21 (TNFRSF11A, P = 0.015 for rs884205). The  SNP rs4729260 at 7q21 remained significantly associated, even after  conservative Bonferroni's correction. Our results further highlight the  importance of these loci in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, and demonstrate  that it is feasible and useful to use OF as the direct phenotype to conduct  genetic studies, to enhance our understanding of the genetic architecture of  osteoporosis."

We aimed to discover novel genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer. We conducted a four-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 19,091 cases and 20,606 controls of East-Asian descent including Chinese, Korean, and Japanese women. After analyzing 690,947 SNPs in 2,918 cases and 2,324 controls, we evaluated 5,365 SNPs for replication in 3,972 cases and 3,852 controls. Ninety-four SNPs were further evaluated in 5,203 cases and 5,138 controls, and finally the top 22 SNPs were investigated in up to 17,423 additional subjects (7,489 cases and 9,934 controls). SNP rs9485372, near the TGF-β activated kinase (TAB2) gene in chromosome 6q25.1, showed a consistent association with breast cancer risk across all four stages, with a P-value of 3.8×10(-12) in the combined analysis of all samples. Adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 0.89 (0.85-0.94) and 0.80 (0.75-0.86) for the A/G and A/A genotypes, respectively, compared with the genotype G/G. SNP rs9383951 (P = 1.9×10(-6) from the combined analysis of all samples), located in intron 5 of the ESR1 gene, and SNP rs7107217 (P = 4.6×10(-7)), located at 11q24.3, also showed a consistent association in each of the four stages. This study provides strong evidence for a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus represented by rs9485372, near the TAB2 gene (6q25.1), and identifies two possible susceptibility loci located in the ESR1 gene and 11q24.3, respectively."
22350153,22350153,A Common variant near the melanocortin 4 receptor is associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol in the Chinese Han population.,"A number of recent genome-wide association studies in European populations have reported that variant rs17782313 is significantly associated with obesity and body mass index (BMI). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association of rs17782313 with obesity and BMI in the Chinese Han population. We also sought to extend previous studies by determining whether this SNP is associated with plasma lipid levels in the Chinese Han population. Rs17782313 was genotyped in two independent Chinese Han cohorts (Cohort1: n = 2533; Cohort2: n = 2105). In our study, rs17782313 did not show significant association with either obesity or BMI in the Chinese Han population, but showed evidence for association with LDL-C (P ~ 0.003) and TC (P ~ 0.001). Our findings indicate that the variant rs17782313 near MC4R is likely to have an impact on plasma lipid levels of LDL-C and TC in the Chinese Han population."
22349157,22349157,SNP rs356219 of the α-synuclein (SNCA) gene is associated with Parkinson's disease in a Chinese Han population.,"Over the last decades, increasing knowledge about the genetic architecture of Parkinson's disease(PD) has provided novel insights into the pathogenesis of the disorder. Recently, several studies in different populations have found a strong association between idiopathic PD and the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs356219, which is located in the 3'UTR of the SNCA gene. In this study, we aimed to verify these findings and to explore further the nature of the association in a subset of Chinese Han PD patients."
22353209,22353209,Genetic variation and significant association of polymorphism rs7700944 G>A of TIM-4 gene with rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility in Chinese Han and Hui populations.,"The T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domains 1 (TIM-1) and 3 (TIM-3) have been shown to be associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in many ethnicities. In this study, we investigated the rs7700944 polymorphism of the intron region of TIM-4 gene in Chinese Han and Hui populations, with and without RA in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of China. Our results demonstrated genetic variations of the TIM-4 gene, along with significantly different distributions of genotypes and alleles at rs7700944 site in these two populations, with or without RA (P < 0.01). In addition, a strong association between the polymorphism with RA susceptibility was found in the studies of Chinese Han and Hui ethnic groups (P < 0.01), although the risk genotype contributed to RA susceptibility was different between the Han and Hui groups (P < 0.01). The AG was the risk genotype for RA in Han population, while GG was the risk genotype at rs7700944 site of TIM-4 gene in Hui ethnicity. In addition to the genotype, the risk alleles of this single nucleotide polymorphism for RA in these two populations were also different, individuals with A allele was more susceptible to RA in Chinese Han [odds ratio (OR) = 1.930; 95% CI 1.412, 2.636; P < 0.01], but the risk allele in Hui was G in this study (OR = 1.823; 95% CI 1.330, 2.498; P < 0.01). These findings strongly suggest that polymorphism of rs7700944 of TIM-4 may be a potential genetic variant among distinguished populations, as well as an important genetic factor associated with the RA susceptibility in many ethnicities."
22393309,22393309,Polymorphic allele of human MRC1 confer protection against tuberculosis in a Chinese population.,"Mannose receptor is a member of the C-type lectin receptor family involved in pathogen molecular-pattern recognition, and plays a critical role in shaping host immune response. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MRC1 gene may affect expression levels and differences in the structure and function of proteins in different individuals, thereby affecting individual susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis. However, to date, MRC1 polymorphisms associated with susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis have not yet been reported. The present study aimed to investigate potential associations of SNPs in the MRC1 gene with pulmonary tuberculosis in a Chinese population. Six SNPs (G1186A, G1195A, T1212C, C1221G, C1303T and C1323T) in exon 7 of the MRC1 gene were genotyped using the PCR and DNA sequencing methods in the pulmonary tuberculosis patients and the healthy controls. Linkage disequilibrium analysis was performed between polymorphic sites. The study found that the allele frequency of G1186A (rs34039386) of the MRC1 gene in a Chinese population was higher in the pulmonary tuberculosis group than the healthy control group. There was a significant difference in frequency distribution between the two groups (P = 0.037; OR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58-0.98). Genotypic analysis also indicated that the AG genotypes in a Chinese population were significantly correlated with pulmonary tuberculosis (P < 0.01; OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37-0.87). After adjustment for age and gender, G1186A sites were found to be dominant (P < 0.01; OR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40-0.87), over-dominant (P = 0.045; OR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.47-0.99) and additive models (P = 0.041; OR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59-0.99) in association with pulmonary tuberculosis. But, no association was found between the other 5 SNPs (G1195A, T1212C, C1221G, C1303T and C1323T) and tuberculosis (P > 0.05). This study is the first to report that genetic variants in the MRC1 gene can be associated with pulmonary tuberculosis in a Chinese population, and may reduce the risk of infecting pulmonary tuberculosis. This also provides a new experimental basis to clarify the pathogenesis of pulmonary tuberculosis."
22369141,22369141,Association between ghrelin gene (GHRL) polymorphisms and clinical response to atypical antipsychotic drugs in Han Chinese schizophrenia patients.,"Ghrelin (GHRL) is a pivotal peptide regulator of food intake, energy balance, and body mass. Weight gain (WG) is a common side effect of the atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) used to treat schizophrenia (SZ). Ghrelin polymorphisms have been associated with pathogenic variations in plasma lipid concentrations, blood pressure, plasma glucose, and body mass index (BMI). However, it is unclear whether GHRL polymorphisms are associated with WG due to AAPs. Furthermore, there is no evidence of an association between GHRL polymorphisms and SZ or the therapeutic response to AAPs. We explored these potential associations by genotyping GHRL alleles in SZ patients and controls. We also examined the relation between these SNPs and changes in metabolic indices during AAP treatment in SZ subgroups distinguished by high or low therapeutic response."
22332214,22332214,Association of IGF1 gene haplotypes with high myopia in Chinese adults.,"To investigate the association of high myopia with common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IGF1, IGFBP3, and IGFBP4 genes in a Chinese population."
22329371,22329371,IL28B genetic variants and gender are associated with spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus infection.,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the IL28B gene have been shown to be associated with response to treatment for chronic hepatitis C and also with spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We analysed the association between IL28B genetic variants and spontaneous clearance of HCV infection in 376 HCV-infected Chinese paid plasma donors. Genotyping of eight SNPs near the IL28B region was performed by the iPLEX system (MassARRAY(®) SNP Genotyping; Sequenom) in all donors, and sequencing was performed on all 80 donors who cleared HCV and on 160 of 296 donors who did not clear HCV to validate the genotypes. Eighty (21.3%) donors spontaneously cleared HCV. Four SNPs were significantly associated with spontaneous HCV clearance: rs8099917 TT (vs GT), rs8105790 TT (vs CT), rs12980275 AA (vs AG) and rs10853728 CC (vs CG or GG) with OR (95% CI) 15.27 (2.07-112.50), 14.88 (2.02-109.72), 7.92 (1.88-33.32) and 2.32 (1.22-4.42) respectively. No association between the other four IL28B SNPs including rs12979860 and spontaneous HCV clearance was found. Women had a higher rate of spontaneous HCV clearance than men [56/213 (26.3%) vs 24/163 (14.6%), P = 0.007], and this was true even after stratification for IL28B genotypes with OR of 1.9-2.2 among those with favourable genotypes. Our results confirmed that IL28B polymorphism is associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV in Chinese subjects, but the SNPs that predict HCV clearance in Chinese subjects were different from those reported in Caucasians. Women were more likely to clear HCV infection regardless of IL28B genotypes."
22337703,22337703,A study of the combined effects of the EHD3 and FREM3 genes in patients with major depressive disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common chronic mental disease with diverse clinical presentation. Although the genome-wide association study (GWAS) has remarkably facilitated the understanding of genetic mechanisms of MDD at a deep molecular level, the combined effect of these disease-underlying genes still needs further investigation. A total of 1,062 unrelated patients with MDD and 992 unrelated healthy subjects were recruited from a Chinese Han population to test 16 MDD-associated genes identified by GWAS. A tag SNP-based linkage-disequilibrium map was then constructed over the loci that showed MDD association in the study sample. Of the 16 genes tested, EHD3 and FREM3 were associated with MDD in the Chinese population. The conditional test showed disease association for the rs619002(EHD3)-rs1112714(FREM3) combination (P = 0.0059) and for the rs644926(EHD3)-rs13130123(FREM3) combination (P = 0.007), of which a reduced risk was found for the rs619002(G)-rs1112714(T) combination (OR = 0, P = 4.02 × 10(-6) ) and for the rs644926(A)-rs11938298(G) combination (OR = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.035-0.39, P = 3.85 × 10(-6) ). Quantitative trait analysis revealed that rs13130123 in the FREM3 locus was strongly associated with the insomnia early symptom in patients carrying the rs619002(G) allele (P = 0.001) and those carrying the rs644926(A) allele (P = 0.00077). The combined effect of the EHD3 and FREM3 genes may play an important role in developing MDD. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
22327646,22327646,Polymorphisms in luteinizing hormone receptor and hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone genes and their effects on sperm quality traits in Chinese Holstein bulls.,"Genes of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis play a key role in male reproductive performance. This study evaluated the polymorphisms of luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) and hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) genes and their effects on sperm quality traits including semen volume per ejaculate (VOL), sperm density (SD), fresh sperm motility (FSM), thawed sperm motility (TSM), acrosome integrity rate (AIR), and abnormal sperm rate (ASR) collected from 205 Chinese Hostein bulls. The study bulls consisted of 205 mature Chinese Holstein, 27 Simmental, 28 Charolais, and 14 German yellow cattle. One single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (A883G) in exon 2 of GnRH and two SNPs (A51703G and G51656T) in intron 9 of LHR were identified in 274 bulls. Analysis of variance in 205 Chinese Holstein bulls showed that age had significant effect on both SD and FSM (P < 0.01), and ASR (P < 0.05). With regards to genotype and its interaction with age, only the SNP of G51656T in LHR gene had significant effect on SD (P < 0.05, P < 0.01; respectively). The association result showed that bulls with AG genotype had higher FSM than bulls with AA and GG genotype in LHR at 51,703 locus (P < 0.10), and bulls with GG genotype had higher SD than bulls with TT genotype in LHR at G51656T locus (P < 0.10). Phenotypic correlation among the traits revealed that significant negative correlations were observed between ASR and AIR (r = -0.736, P < 0.01), ASR and AIR (r = -0.500, P < 0.01). There were moderate positive correlations between VOL and SD (r = 0.422, P < 0.01), as well as FSM (r = 0.411, P < 0.01). In conclusion, LHR may be a potential marker for sperm quality of SD and FSM."
22328951,22328951,GC Glu416Asp and Thr420Lys polymorphisms contribute to gastrointestinal cancer susceptibility in a Chinese population.,"Vitamin D has potent anticancer properties, especially against gastrointestinal cancers. Group-specific component (GC), a key member of vitamin D pathway proteins, could bind to and transport vitamin D to target organs. As a polymorphic protein, two common coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) [Glu416Asp (rs7041) and Thr420Lys (rs4588)] were identified in its gene. These SNPs have been associated to circulating vitamin D levels and several cancer risks in different populations. However, there is no report on their role in gastrointestinal cancer development among Chinese to date. Therefore, we examined the association between these variants and risk of gastrointestinal cancers in a case-control cohort including 964 patients with four gastrointestinal cancers (hepatocellular carcinoma, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer) and 1187 controls. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated by logistic regression. We found that GC Thr420Lys polymorphism has significant impact on the risk of developing gastrointestinal cancers, especially colorectal cancer. Additionally, subjects who carrying GC Asp(416)-Lys(420) haplotype, which contains the at-risk 420Lys allele, also showed significantly increased risk to develop gastrointestinal cancers. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that common genetic variants and haplo-types in GC may influence individual susceptibility to gastrointestinal cancers in Chinese population."
22311941,22311941,Association of chemokine CXCL12-3'G801A polymorphism with systemic lupus erythematosus in a Han Chinese population.,"CXCL12, also known as stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1), is a CXC chemokine. Recent reports have shown that CXCL12 might play key roles in a murine model of lupus and in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A common variant at position 801 in 3'-untranslated region in CXCL12 gene (designated CXCL12-3'G801A) has been reported in association with autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and systemic sclerosis. We investigated the influence of CXCL12-3'G801A polymorphism on susceptibility to SLE by genotyping this single nucleotide polymorphism in 422 SLE patients and 374 healthy controls. The frequency of G/G homozygote was observed in 60.0% of SLE patients and in 52.7% of healthy individuals (χ(2 )= 4.275, p = 0.039). Compared with patients with G/A and A/A genotype, SLE patients with G/G genotype were also more prone to developing photosensitivity (χ(2 )= 6.778, p = 0.034), renal damage (χ(2 )= 6.388, p = 0.041) and to producing antibodies against nucleosomes (χ(2 )= 8.341, p = 0.015). Moreover, the plasma level of CXCL12α was also significantly increased in patients with G/G homozygote than in healthy controls carrying the same genotype [(4067.0 ± 1092.3) pg/ml vs. (3278.5 ± 547.4) pg/ml, p = 0.002]. Our results suggest that polymorphism in CXCL12-3'G801A might be a genetic risk factor for developing SLE. The association of G/G homozygote with nephritis and skin damage developed in SLE patients might be due to its effects upon the production of auto-antibodies and CXCL12 protein."
22313133,22313133,Genetic variants at 14q24.1 and breast cancer susceptibility: a fine-mapping study in Chinese women.,"A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs999737 at 14q24.1 was identified as a susceptibility marker of breast cancer in a genome-wide association study of the European population, which was also confirmed by some of the following studies in populations of European descent. However, rs999737 is very rare or nonpolymorphic in non-Europeans including Chinese, and the role of other genetic variants at 14q24.1 has not been evaluated in populations of non-European descent. In this study, we first selected 21 common tagging SNPs (minor allele frequency [MAF] >0.05 in the Chinese population) by searching the Hapmap database, covering a linage disequilibrium region of more than 70 Kb at 14q24.1, and then conducted a two-stage study (stage I: 878 cases and 900 controls; stage II: 914 cases and 967 controls) to investigate the associations between these tagging SNPs and risk of breast cancer in a Chinese population. In stage I, two SNPs (rs2842346 and rs17828907) were identified to be significantly associated with breast cancer risk (p=0.030 and 0.027 for genotype distributions, respectively). However, no significant associations were found between these two SNPs and breast cancer risk in either stage II or the combined dataset. These findings suggest that common variants at 14q24.1 might not be associated with the risk of breast cancer in the Chinese population, which will need the replication in additional larger studies."
22313735,22313735,Identify the association between polymorphisms of BLK and systemic lupus erythematosus through unlabelled probe-based high-resolution melting analysis.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex immune disease. The genetic variation in the B lymphoid tyrosine kinase (BLK) gene was found to associate with SLE in Caucasian population. However, the association of rs13277113 and rs4840568 with SLE was not extensively studied in Chinese population. In this study, we aim to test the association of SNP rs13277113 and rs4840568 with the disease risk of SLE in Chinese mainland population. A total of 532 patients with SLE and 576 controls were recruited. Unlabelled probe-based high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) was used in genotyping. HRMA with unlabelled probe successfully distinguished all genotypes. Significant differences were observed in both genotype and allele frequencies for rs13277113 and rs4840568. Minor alleles of rs13277113 (P = 4.2E-05, odds ratio [OR] 0.66, [95% CI 0.54-0.81]) and rs4840568 (P = 7.1E-05, OR 0.67, [95% CI 0.55-0.82]) were found to be protective against SLE. Polymorphisms of rs13277113 and rs4840568 in BLK gene were associated with SLE in Chinese population."

22309839,22309839,Association study of 45 candidate genes in nicotine dependence in Han Chinese.,"Numerous genetic linkages, association studies have been performed in different ethnic groups and revealed many susceptibility loci and genes for nicotine dependence. However, limited similar researches were performed in Han Chinese. This study was designed to investigate the association of candidate genes with nicotine dependence in Han Chinese. We genotyped 384 SNPs within 45 candidate genes with nicotine dependence in a Han Chinese population consisting 223 high nicotine dependent subjects and 257 low nicotine dependent subjects by employing GoldenGate genotyping assay (Illumina). Following association analysis was performed using PLINK software. Individual SNP-based association analysis revealed that nine SNPs located in DRD3 (rs2630351), DRD5 (rs1967550), MAP3K4 (rs2314378), DDC (rs11575461), CHRNB3 (rs4954), GABBR2 (rs2779562), DRD2 (rs11214613 and rs6589377) and CHRNA4 (rs2236196) were significantly associated with FTND after correction for multiple testing with the p values from 2.59×10(-7) to 9.99×10(-5). Haplotype-based association analysis revealed haplotype G-A-A formed by rs2630351, rs167771 and rs324032 and haplotype G-G-G-A formed by rs3773678, rs2630349, rs2630351 and rs167771 in DRD3; haplotype of G-A formed by rs2779562 and rs2808566 in GABBR2 and haplotype of T-T-A-G-A formed by rs6832644, rs4057797, rs9764, rs4552421 and rs10033119 in NPY1R are associated with FTND (p=3.61×10(-7)-8.78×10(-6)). Our results provided confirmation of the previous findings that DRD2, DRD3, DDC, CHRNB3, GABBR2 and CHRNA4 are associated with nicotine dependence. Furthermore, we for the first time report a significant association between nicotine dependence and DRD5, MAP3K4 and NPY1R. These findings need independent replication in the future studies."
22296403,22296403,Common variants of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) are associated with reduced insulin secretion in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Common variants of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene were identified as one of the few genetic polymorphisms with powerful effects on the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Given the genetic overlap between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and T2D, the present study was undertaken to investigate whether the TCF7L2 variants are also associated with PCOS. We analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs11196218 and rs290487 of the TCF7L2 gene, which showed robust associations with T2D in Chinese population, in 430 PCOS patients and 360 control subjects by pyrosequencing, and also assessed the effect of genotype on clinical and biochemical traits in the PCOS group. We found no evidence for association between SNP rs11196218 and PCOS. The SNP rs290487 showed marginal differences in genotype frequencies between the PCOS and control group, with the minor C allele being the at-risk allele for PCOS. In PCOS women, the C allele carriers of rs290487 had higher levels of 2h blood glucose but lower insulinogenic index than noncarriers, suggesting impaired insulin secretion. Our data suggested that the TCF7L2 variants may confer an increased risk for early impairment of glucose homeostasis in PCOS."

22292798,22292798,Identification of a novel missense mutation in angiogenin in a Chinese amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cohort.,"Abstract   Angiogenin (ANG) gene mutations have been identified in both familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients from multiple European and North American populations. However, no ANG mutation has yet been reported in Asian ALS populations. Here, we screened for ANG mutations in a Chinese ALS cohort. The entire coding region of the ANG gene was sequenced in 10 familial ALS pedigrees, 202 sporadic ALS patients, and 151 healthy controls. All patients were negative for SOD1, FUS, and TARDBP mutations. We identified a novel missense mutation, c.379G > A (p.V103I), in one sporadic ALS patient, but not in the controls. No mutations were found in the familial ALS patients. A novel missense variant, c.323A > G (p.H84R), was detected in one healthy individual. We identified the presence of the known single nucleotide polymorphism, rs11701 (T/G), in both ALS cases and controls. However, no significant association of the G allele with ALS susceptibility was demonstrated. In conclusion, ANG mutations accounted for 0.5% of our SOD1-, FUS-, TARDBP- mutation-negative ALS cohort. Our findings highlight that the genetic background of ALS differs between different populations, and suggest that ANG mutation may be involved in the aetiology of ALS in the Han Chinese population."

Data from animal studies suggest that PPARγ may be involved in breast tumorigenesis, but results from epidemiologic studies on the association between PPARγ variation and breast cancer risk have been mixed. Recent data suggest that soy isoflavones can activate PPARγ. We investigated the interrelations of soy, PPARγ, and mammographic density, a biomarker of breast cancer risk in a cross-sectional study of 2,038 women who were members of the population-based Singapore Chinese Health Study Cohort."
22292851,22292851,Comprehensive analysis of the association of SCN1A gene polymorphisms with the retention rate of carbamazepine following monotherapy for new-onset focal seizures in the Chinese Han population.,"The aim of the present study was to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the sodium channel a subunit type 1 (SCN1A) gene affect the retention rate of carbamazepine (CBZ) used to treat seizures in Chinese Han patients with epilepsy. In total, 448 patients were genotyped for SNPs selected in the SCN1A gene. The tag SNPs were selected using Haploview version 4.2 software (http://www.broad.mit.edu/haploview/haploview, accessed 18 Sept 2009). Monotherapy with CBZ was administered to patients with new-onset focal seizures. In the present study, the retention rate of CBZ was defined as the percentage of patients with epilepsy who had continued with CBZ treatment in the preceding 3 months. Potential confounding variables were analysed to evaluate the risk factors for non-retention. When adjusted for potential confounding factors (e.g. age, sex, body mass index, seizure type etc.), the presence of the A allele of SNP rs3812718 predicted non-retention (P = 0.015; odds ratio (OR) = 3.122; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.823-4.893). Beyond 12 months of treatment in those that continued with CBZ (retention cohort), analysis of covariance indicated that the maintenance dose (P = 0.025) and serum CBZ levels (P = 0.021) were significantly higher in carriers of the rs3812718 AA genotype than in those with the GG genotype. The results of the present study indicate that the rs3812718 SNP in the SCN1A gene is significantly associated with the retention rate of CBZ monotherapy in Chinese Han patients with focal epilepsy."

In total, 300 AIS patients fulfilled the clinical criteria and 788 controls with MRI scans of the spine were included in the replication study. We employed case-control analysis to study the association of SNP rs11190870 near LBX1 (ladybird homeobox 1) with AIS in a southern Chinese population. The results suggest that SNP rs11190870 is significantly associated with AIS (P=9.1 × 10(-10); odds ratio=1.85; 95% confidence interval=1.52-2.25). The results of this study confirm that SNP rs11190870 is associated with AIS."
22285701,22285701,Association of copy number variation in the AHI1 gene with risk of obesity in the Chinese population.,The prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically over the past decade. Gene copy number variants (CNVs) have been recognized as a hereditable source of susceptibility in human complex diseases including obesity. Recent studies have shown that Abelson helper integration site 1 (Ahi1) gene has a significant contribution in the homeostasis regulation in mouse models of obesity. A study was therefore carried out to investigate whether CNVs in AHI1 gene contribute to human obesity.
22249287,22249287,Association of CTLA-4 gene polymorphisms with sporadic breast cancer risk and clinical features in Han women of northeast China.,"Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is an inhibitory molecule that plays a pivotal role in downregulating T-cell mediated immune responses. To determine the role of CTLA-4 in tumor immunity, and to validate previous results as well, we investigated four tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CTLA-4 in a relatively large Chinese Han cohort from northeastern China. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in 581 patients and 566 age-matched controls. Our data indicated that compared with the common genotype and allele of each SNP, the -1722 CC genotype and C allele showed an increased risk of breast cancer (P = 0.030, odds ratio (OR) = 1.457, 95% confidence internal (CI) 1.036-2.051; P = 0.024, OR = 1.214, 95% CI 1.026-1.436, respectively). The -1661 GG genotype and G allele were also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (P = 0.018, OR = 1.396, 95% CI 1.058-1.843; P = 0.013, OR = 1.353, 95% CI 1.066-1.717, respectively). In the haplotype analysis, the CAAA haplotype showed a higher frequency in cases (P = 0.004), and this association remained significant after correcting the P value for multiple testing. Associations were shown between the SNPs of CTLA-4 and lymph node metastasis, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and P53 statuses. These results indicate that some SNPs in the CTLA-4 gene may affect the risk of breast cancer and show that some SNPs are associated with breast cancer characteristics in Han women in northeastern China."
22241462,22241462,A functional variant of the collagen type III alpha1 gene modify risk of sporadic intracranial aneurysms.,"Abnormalities in type III collagen in the arterial walls cause certain familial intracranial aneurysms (IAs); however, it remains unknown whether COL3A1 variants contribute to the risk of sporadic IAs. To study whether COL3A1 variants are associated with sporadic IAs, the association of COL3A1 variants with sporadic IAs was tested in 298 cases and 488 controls, replicated in an independent population of 192 cases and 1,690 controls, and further verified in 633 patients with intra-cerebral hemorrhage, 1,074 hypertensives, and 1,883 controls. We found that allele A of SNP rs1800255 conferred a 1.71-fold increased risk for IAs (adjusted odds ratio: OR = 1.71, 95% confidence interval: CI 1.19-2.45, P = 0.004) and results in an amino acid change of Ala698Thr, which led to a lower thermal stability of the peptide. These results were confirmed in the independent study. The associations were independent of the presence of hemorrhagic stroke and hypertension. These results support the view that the functional variant of COL3A1 is genetic risk factors for IAs in the Chinese population."

22241816,22241816,Relationship between CRP polymorphism and cardiovascular events in Chinese peritoneal dialysis patients.,"The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -717A→G substitution, rs2794521, was found in the promoter of the C-reactive protein (CRP) gene. Functional studies showed that A allele promoter has higher transcriptional activity than the G allele. This study investigated the association between this SNP and the outcome of Chinese patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD)."
22272615,22272615,Common variants in toll-like receptor 4 confer susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease in a Han Chinese population.,"Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) represents a reasonable functional and positional candidate gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD) as it is located within the previous identified linkage region of AD on chromosome 9q, and functionally is involved in the microglia-mediated inflammatory response, amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque formation and Aβ clearance. To test whether variants in the TLR4 gene are associated with late-onset AD (LOAD), we organized a multicenter study of 785 subjects (399 cases and 386 matched controls) in a Han Chinese population. Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that span the TLR4 gene, from approximately 5 kb of the predicted 5'-untranslated region (UTR) to approximately 6 kb of the predicted 3'- UTR, were selected and their associations with LOAD risk factors were assessed. With respect to allelic diversity, the minor alleles of seven SNPs (rs10759930, rs1927914, rs1927911, rs12377632, rs2149356, rs7037117, and rs7045953) in TLR4 showed consistent protective effects against the risk of developing LOAD. With regard to genotypic diversity, individuals carrying at least one minor allele of each SNP above had a consistently lower risk of LOAD than those with no copies of the minor alleles (ORs ranging from 0.445 to 0.637). rs7045953, located in the 3'-UTR of TLR4, was most strongly associated with LOAD, and when incorporated into a haplotype with rs10759930, the strongest association was detected (P = 1.7x10-6, Pc s1.0x10-4). Our data suggests that the TLR4 gene contributes to the susceptibility for LOAD in Han Chinese."
22233601,22233601,"Transancestral mapping of the MHC region in systemic lupus erythematosus identifies new independent and interacting loci at MSH5, HLA-DPB1 and HLA-G.","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic multisystem genetically complex autoimmune disease characterised by the production of autoantibodies to nuclear and cellular antigens, tissue inflammation and organ damage. Genome-wide association studies have shown that variants within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6 confer the greatest genetic risk for SLE in European and Chinese populations. However, the causal variants remain elusive due to tight linkage disequilibrium across disease-associated MHC haplotypes, the highly polymorphic nature of many MHC genes and the heterogeneity of the SLE phenotype."
22234156,22234156,Association of TCF4 and CLU polymorphisms with Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy and implication of CLU and TGFBI proteins in the disease process.,"Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy (FED) is a disease affecting the corneal endothelium. Recent studies reported significant association of polymorphisms in the TCF4 (transcription factor 4) gene, and a borderline association of PTPRG (protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, G) variants with late-onset FED in Caucasians from the United States. Association of TCF4 has also been reported in the Chinese population. We aimed to determine association of the reported polymorphisms in TCF4 and PTPRG, and association of polymorphisms in the candidate genes ZEB1 (zinc-finger E-box binding homoebox 1), COL8A2 (collagen, type VIII, alpha 2), TGFBI (transforming growth factor, β-induced) and CLU (clusterin) in Australian cases. We also compared the expression of TGFBI and CLU proteins between FED and normal whole corneas. In all, 30 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the candidate genes were genotyped in 103 cases and 275 controls. Each SNP and haplotype was assessed for association with the disease. SNP analysis identified an association of TCF4 (rs613872 (P=5.25 × 10(-15), OR=4.05), rs9954153 (P=3.37 × 10(-7), OR=2.58), rs2286812 (P=4.23 × 10(-6), OR=2.55) and rs17595731 (P=3.57 × 10(-5), OR=3.79)), CLU (rs17466684; P=0.003, OR=1.85) and one haplotype of TGFBI SNPs (P=0.011, OR=2.29) with FED in Caucasian Australians. No evidence for genetic association of PTPRG, ZEB1 and COL8A2 was found. Immunohistochemistry showed differential expression of CLU and TGFBI proteins in FED-affected compared with normal corneas. In conclusion, variation in TCF4, CLU and TGFBI, but not PTPRG, ZEB1 and COL8A2 genes are associated with FED in Caucasian Australian cases. Differential expression of CLU and TGFBI proteins in FED-affected corneas provides novel insights into the disease mechanism."
22225470,22225470,Association of a TANK gene polymorphism with outcomes of hepatitis B virus infection in a Chinese Han population.,"The host genetic compound plays a vital role in determining clinical outcomes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor family member-associated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activator (TANK) takes part in the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway and the interferon (IFN)-induction pathways that have relevance to HBV-related liver disease. In this report, we explored whether the intronic polymorphism rs3820998 of the TANK gene was associated with outcomes of HBV infection by binary logistic regression analysis. A total of 1305 unrelated Han Chinese patients recruited from Wuhan, including 180 acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure (ACLF-HBV) patients, 331 HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, 308 HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, and 486 asymptomatic HBV carriers (AsC) were genotyped using the TaqMan probe method. Logistic analysis revealed that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3820998 was significantly associated with susceptibility to ACLF-HBV (dominant model, OR 0.643, 95% CI 0.428,0.964, p=0.033; additive model, OR 0.640, 95% CI 0.414,0.990, p=0.045), and LC (recessive model, OR 0.398, 95% CI 0.164,0.966, p=0.042; additive model, OR 0.379, 95% CI 0.155,0.928, p=0.034). These results indicate that the G > T variant is a protective factor in the development of ACLF-HBV and LC, and that the SNP rs3820998 in the TANK gene may play a role in mediating susceptibility to ACLF-HBV and LC in a Chinese Han population."
22216221,22216221,Genome-wide association study identifies candidate genes that affect plant height in Chinese elite maize (Zea mays L.) inbred lines.,"The harvest index for many crops can be improved through introduction of dwarf stature to increase lodging resistance, combined with early maturity. The inbred line Shen5003 has been widely used in maize breeding in China as a key donor line for the dwarf trait. Also, one major quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling plant height has been identified in bin 5.05-5.06, across several maize bi-parental populations. With the progress of publicly available maize genome sequence, the objective of this work was to identify the candidate genes that affect plant height among Chinese maize inbred lines with genome wide association studies (GWAS)."
22227290,22227290,Association between TNF-α promoter -308A/G polymorphism and tardive dyskinesian Chinese Han patients with schizophrenia.,"Previous studies have indicated that the immune may be involved in the pathogenesis of tardive dyskinesia (TD). Some genetic polymorphisms in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) I and II regions have been associated with TD, and the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) gene is located in the HLA III region. TNF-α levels in the striatum significantly increased in haloperidol-induced TD in rats. The TNF-α gene -308A/G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been shown to directly influence TNF-α expression. The genetic association between the TNF-α gene -308A/G SNP and TD is unclear. The present study investigated whether this variation is associated with clinical phenotypes and TD in schizophrenia in a genetically homogeneous northern Chinese Han population."
22232737,22232737,Novel genetic markers of breast cancer survival identified by a genome-wide association study.,"Only two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted to date to identify potential markers for total mortality after diagnosis of breast cancer. Here, we report the identification of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with total mortality from a two-stage GWAS conducted among 6,110 Shanghai-resident Chinese women with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage I to IV breast cancer. The discovery stage included 1,950 patients and evaluated 613,031 common SNPs. The top 49 associations were evaluated in an independent replication stage of 4,160 Shanghai patients with breast cancer. A consistent and highly significant association with total mortality was documented for SNPs rs3784099 and rs9934948. SNP rs3784099, located in the RAD51L1 gene, was associated with total morality in both the discovery stage (P = 1.44 × 10(-8)) and replication stage (P = 0.06; P-combined = 1.17 × 10(-7)). Adjusted HRs for total mortality were 1.41 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.18-1.68] for the AG genotype and 2.64 (95% CI, 1.74-4.03) for the AA genotype, when compared with the GG genotype. The variant C allele of rs9934948, located on chromosome 16, was associated with a similarly elevated risk of total mortality (P-combined = 5.75 × 10(-6)). We also observed this association among 1,145 patients with breast cancer of European ancestry from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS; P = 0.006); the association was highly significant in a combined analysis of NHS and Chinese data (P = 1.39 × 10(-7)). Similar associations were observed for these two SNPs with breast cancer-specific mortality. This study provides strong evidence suggesting that the RAD51L1 gene and a chromosome 16 locus influence breast cancer prognosis."
22213098,22213098,Identification of a functional variant in SPLUNC1 associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma susceptibility among Malaysian Chinese.,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a multifactorial and polygenic disease with high incidence in Asian countries. Epstein-Barr virus infection, environmental and genetic factors are believed to be involved in the tumorigenesis of NPC. The association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LPLUNC1 and SPLUNC1 genes with NPC was investigated by performing a two-stage case control association study in a Malaysian Chinese population. The initial screening consisted of 81 NPC patients and 147 healthy controls while the replication study consisted of 366 NPC patients and 340 healthy controls. The combined analysis showed that a SNP (rs2752903) of SPLUNC1 was significantly associated with the risk of NPC (combined P = 0.00032, odds ratio = 1.62, 95% confidence interval = 1.25-2.11). In the subsequent dense fine mapping of SPLUNC1 locus, 36 SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs2752903 (r(2) ≥ 0.85) were associated with NPC susceptibility. Screening of these variants by electrophoretic mobility shift and luciferase reporter assays showed that rs1407019 located in intron 3 (r(2)  = 0.994 with rs2752903) caused allelic difference in the binding of specificity protein 1 (Sp1) transcription factor and affected luciferase activity. This SNP may consequently alter the expression of SPLUNC1 in the epithelial cells. In summary, our study suggested that rs1407019 in intronic enhancer of SPLUNC1 is associated with NPC susceptibility in which its A allele confers an increased risk of NPC in the Malaysian Chinese population."
22212192,22212192,Polymorphisms of NOD2 and the risk of tuberculosis: a validation study in the Chinese population.,"A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of leprosy reported four specific genetic polymorphisms of NOD2 that were associated with susceptibility to Mycobacterium leprae in China. Considering the role of NOD2 in innate immune defence, we performed a study in a Chinese population to determine whether the same SNPs of NOD2 that were associated with disease caused by M. leprae were also associated with disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We performed a frequency-matched case-control study in 1043 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and 808 unaffected controls. All subjects were >15 years old and were Han Chinese from Jiangsu Province. We extracted DNA from a blood sample from each study participant. SNPs of rs3135499, rs7194886, rs8057341 and rs9302752 in the NOD2 gene were genotyped using a TaqMan-based allelic discrimination system. Using all possible patients with tuberculosis as cases, no significant association was found between the four specific SNPs and the risk of tuberculosis. In a subgroup analysis restricted to cases with bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis (sputum culture positive), the variant genotype of rs7194886 was significantly associated with an altered risk of tuberculosis. Compared with the CC genotype, individuals carrying the CT/TT genotype of rs7194886 had an increased risk [odds ratio (OR) 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.05-1.72)]. The association was stronger among tobacco smokers and males. By haplotype analysis, rs9302752C-rs7194886T was associated with an increased risk of bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis (sputum culture positive) (P = 0.039), but it was not significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. In summary, genetic polymorphisms of the SNP rs7194886 in the NOD2 gene, which were discovered in the GWAS of leprosy, might also be associated with the pulmonary tuberculosis in the Chinese population."
25215050,25215050,Association of genetic variants in the IRAK-4 gene with susceptibility to severe sepsis.,"The association of genetic variation in the IRAK-1 gene with sepsis outcome has been proved. However, few studies have addressed the impact of the IRAK-4 gene variants on sepsis risk. This study aimed to determine whether the polymorphisms in the IRAK-4 gene are associated with susceptibility to and prognosis of severe sepsis in the Chinese Han ethnic population."
22201027,22201027,Variant allele of CHEK2 is associated with a decreased risk of esophageal cancer lymph node metastasis in a Chinese population.,"Growing evidence suggests that the checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) signaling pathway occupies a central position in the signaling networks of DNA-damage signaling. Many functional and molecular epidemiological studies have evaluated the association between genetic variants of CHEK2 and various cancers. To evaluate the relationship between CHEK2 functional genetic variants and esophageal cancer risk and the risk of lymph node metastasis among a Chinese population. We genotyped CHEK2 rs738722, rs2236141 and rs2236142 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry assay in a case-controlled study, including 380 esophageal cancer cases and 380 healthy controls in a Chinese population. We found that none of the three polymorphisms achieved significant difference in their distributions between esophageal cancer cases and controls. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that esophageal cancer risk was not associated significantly with the variant genotypes of the three CHEK2 polymorphisms as compared with their wild-type genotypes. However, we found that functional variant rs738722 and rs2236142 in CHEK2 might contribute to susceptibility to lymph node metastasis. Our data did not support a significant association between CHEK2 SNPs and the risk of esophageal cancer. Functional variant CHEK2 rs738722 and rs2236142 might contribute to lymph node metastasis susceptibility. The CT allele of SNP rs738722 and the GC allele of SNP rs2236142 might be a protective factor of the risk for lymph node metastasis of esophageal cancer."
22197220,22197220,Cigarette smoking strongly modifies the association of complement factor H variant and the risk of lung cancer.,"The complement system is an important immunosurveillance mechanism against tumors, and complement factor H (CFH) is a key regulator for activation of the complement system. Expression of complement factor H has been demonstrated in cell lines from several malignancies. In this study we examined the contribution of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) Try402His (Y402H) (rs1061170) in the CFH gene to the risk of lung cancer in a case-control study with 1000 cases and 1000 controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed by logistic regression. The frequencies for CFH Y402H genotypes among the cases were statistically significantly different from those among controls (χ(2)=8.66, P=0.003), with 402His/His or 402His/Try genotypes being over-represented among patients compared with controls (13.6% versus 9.4%, P<0.004). A multivariate regression analysis showed that a significantly increased risk of lung cancer for the 402His/His or 402His/Try carriers with OR (95% CI), 1.50 (1.12-2.00). When stratified by smoking status, the elevated risk of the cancer associated with variant CFH genotypes was observed among smokers, but not among non-smokers. When analyzed with cumulative smoking dose (pack-years), a super-multiplicative interaction was observed at different smoking levels. Among carriers with the 402Tyr/His or His/His genotype, the ORs of developing lung cancer for smoking<16, 16-28, or >28 pack-years were 0.98 (0.49-1.94), 2.36 (1.14-4.90), and 6.39 (3.49-11.68), respectively. These findings suggest that CFH Y402H polymorphism may interact with cigarette smoking to effect the development of lung cancer in the Chinese population."
22208664,22208664,Sex-specific association of rs16996148 SNP in the NCAN/CILP2/PBX4 and serum lipid levels in the Mulao and Han populations.,"The association of rs16996148 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in NCAN/CILP2/PBX4 and serum lipid levels is inconsistent. Furthermore, little is known about the association of rs16996148 SNP and serum lipid levels in the Chinese population. We therefore aimed to detect the association of rs16996148 SNP and several environmental factors with serum lipid levels in the Guangxi Mulao and Han populations."
22203178,22203178,Putatively functional PLCE1 variants and susceptibility to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC): a case-control study in eastern Chinese populations.,"A novel variant rs2274223 located in the phospholipase C epsilon 1 (PLCE1) gene was found to be associated with risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) by 2 large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in Chinese populations. In this study, we aimed to assess such an association in an eastern Chinese population and to address its possibly functional role in the etiology of ESCC."
22194190,22194190,S323I  polymorphism of the C5L2 gene was not identified in a Chinese population with familial combined  hyperlipidemia or with type 2 diabetes.,"C5L2,  a G protein-coupled receptor, is known to be a functional receptor of  acylation-stimulating protein, which is a stimulator of triglyceride synthesis  and glucose transport. A novel C5L2 variant (S323I) was identified and its  association with familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH) was recently reported.  We looked for this SNP in three Chinese ethnic groups, including Han, Uygur,  and Kazakh controls and patients with FCH and type 2 diabetes. One hundred and  eighty-two unrelated subjects (77 of Han, 57 of Uygur, and 48 of Kazakh) with  FCH were genotyped by direct sequencing, and 852 subjects (342 of Han, 338 of  Uygur, 172 of Kazakh) with type 2 diabetes and 200 healthy controls (67 of Han,  72 of Uygur, and 61 of Kazakh) chosen from a cardiovascular risk survey study  were genotyped with PCR-RFLP analysis. All 182 subjects with FCH, 99.5% of the  type 2 diabetes patients and 100% of the healthy controls were successfully  genotyped. Neither the FCH subjects nor the type 2 diabetes patients were found  to have the S323I variant. This variant was also not identified in the healthy  controls. We found no evidence to demonstrate that the S323I polymorphism  contributes to familial combined hyperlipidemia or type 2 diabetes in the  Chinese population."

22184102,22184102,SEMA3A rs7804122 polymorphism is associated with Hirschsprung disease in the Northeastern region of China.,"Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital disorder characterized by an absence of intrinsic ganglion cells in the nerve plexuses of the lower colon. Our previous results showed increased semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A) expression may be the risk factor for HSCR pathology in a subset of patients. Therefore, the association between polymorphisms in SEMA3A and the risk of HSCR was examined."
22182247,22182247,Potentially functional genetic variants in KDR gene as prognostic markers in patients with resected colorectal cancer.,"Angiogenesis plays a key role in the development and treatment response of various tumors. The signaling transductions mediated by the binding of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to its receptor KDR (kinase insert domain receptor) is the most important pathway in tumor angiogenesis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VEGF have been extensively implicated in the etiology and treatment outcome of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, no study has been reported evaluating the role of KDR SNPs in CRC prognosis. We herein assessed the association between four potentially functional KDR SNPs and tumor recurrence in a Chinese population with 408 surgically resected CRC patients. The most significant SNP was for rs10013228 located in the KDR gene promoter. Compared with the homozygous wild-type genotype, the variant-containing genotypes of this SNP were significantly associated with a reduced recurrence risk with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.30-0.95, P = 0.032). Moreover, a borderline significant association was noted for another promoter SNP, rs2071559, with an HR of 0.67 (95% CI 0.42-1.07, P = 0.092). In stratified analysis, the associations of both SNPs were more prominent in patients receiving chemotherapy (HR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.23-0.94, P = 0.033 for rs10013228 and HR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.95, P = 0.032 for rs2071559). Further analysis revealed a protective effect on patient recurrence by chemotherapy (HR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.32-1.01, P = 0.046), which was more evident in patients with the variant-containing genotypes of each of the two SNPs (HR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.55, P = 0.009 for rs10013228 and HR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.18-0.86, P = 0.020 for rs2071559). Collectively, our findings suggest SNPs in the KDR gene modulate CRC recurrence, especially in those receiving chemotherapy."
22198721,22198721,GWAS-linked GAK locus in Parkinson's disease in Han Chinese and meta-analysis.,"Genome-wide association studies of Parkinson's disease (PD) have recently identified a new susceptibility locus GAK (PARK17) (rs1564282 variant) in subjects of European ancestry. Its role in other races is still unclear. The potential differences of the clinical characteristics between carriers and non-carriers have not been examined in detail. Using a case-control methodology, we analyzed the GAK rs1564282 variant in an ethnic Han Chinese population and conducted a meta-analysis combining our result and available published data. A total of 1,574 ethnic Han Chinese study subjects comprising 812 sporadic PD patients and 762 control individuals were included. The minor allele frequency was significantly different at SNP rs1564282 between the cases and the controls (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.09, 1.69, P = 0.007) in the overall PD population. Subjects with CT + TT genotypes have an increased risk (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.72, P = 0.017) compared to those with CC genotype. A meta-analysis revealed that the frequency of carrier's genotypes was significantly higher in PD than in control subjects (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.19, 1.44, P < 0.00001). The gender, age of onset, Hoehn-Yahr stage and UPDRS scores and clinical features were similar between carriers and non-carriers. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the rs1564282 variant in GAK (PARK17) increases the risk of PD in Han Chinese patients from mainland China and the meta-analysis with European populations revealed a similar finding. However, carriers cannot be distinguished from non-carriers based on their clinical features or motor severity. Functional studies of GAK to unravel its role in the pathophysiologic pathway of PD will be useful."
22171703,22171703,An rs9621532 variant near the TIMP3 gene is not associated with neovascular age-related macular degeneration and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy in a Chinese Han population.,"Recently, two genome-wide association studies with large cohorts both identified rs9621532, a new single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that is associated with advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and located near the TIMP3 gene. Previous studies have demonstrated that AMD and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) share some common genetic background and that the incidence of PCV is higher in Asian populations than Caucasian populations. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the rs9621532 SNP is associated with neovascular AMD (nAMD) and PCV in a Chinese Han population."
22171069,22171069,Post-genome wide association studies and functional analyses identify association of MPP7 gene variants with site-specific bone mineral density.,"Our previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a Hong Kong Southern Chinese population with extreme bone mineral density (BMD) scores revealed suggestive association with MPP7, which ranked second after JAG1 as a candidate gene for BMD. To follow-up this suggestive signal, we replicated the top single-nucleotide polymorphism rs4317882 of MPP7 in three additional independent Asian-descent samples (n= 2684). The association of rs4317882 reached the genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis of all available subjects (P(meta)= 4.58 × 10(-8), n= 4204). Site heterogeneity was observed, with a larger effect on spine than hip BMD. Further functional studies in a zebrafish model revealed that vertebral bone mass was lower in an mpp7 knock-down model compared with the wide-type (P= 9.64 × 10(-4), n= 21). In addition, MPP7 was found to have constitutive expression in human bone-derived cells during osteogenesis. Immunostaining of murine MC3T3-E1 cells revealed that the Mpp7 protein is localized in the plasma membrane and intracytoplasmic compartment of osteoblasts. In an assessment of the function of identified variants, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated the binding of transcriptional factor GATA2 to the risk allele 'A' but not the 'G' allele of rs4317882. An mRNA expression study in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells confirmed that the low BMD-related allele 'A' of rs4317882 was associated with lower MPP7 expression (P= 9.07 × 10(-3), n= 135). Our data suggest a genetic and functional association of MPP7 with BMD variation."
22167654,22167654,Association studies of 19 candidate SNPs with sporadic Alzheimer's disease in the North Chinese Han population.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As replication in independent studies remains the only way to validate proposed GWAS signals, we detect SNPs reported in the GWAS, in order to explore their association with sporadic AD (SAD) in the Chinese population. We analyzed genotype and allele distributions of 19 SNPs reported in GWAS in 191 SAD patients and 180 healthy controls. We found that higher frequencies of rs10868366 G and rs7019241 C carriers were observed in SAD patients compared with controls (rs10868366 G: P = 0.026, odds ratio (OR) = 1.4, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.0-1.9; rs7019241 C: P = 0.019, OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.6-1.9). Furthermore, rs10868366 G/T and rs7019241 C/T in GOLPH2 were in strong linkage disequilibrium and formed a relative protective factor rs10868366 T/rs7019241 T and a relative risk factor rs10868366 G/rs7019241 C. For SNP rs3826656 in near gene 5' region of CD33, the results revealed that in subjects with APOE ε4 alleles, the A allele was associated with a reduced risk of SAD compared with the G allele (OR 0.479; 95% CI 0.263-0.870, P = 0.015), and AA genotype was associated with a reduced risk of SAD compared with the genotype AG + GG (OR 0.395; 95% CI 0.158-0.659, P = 0.008). Our results support the view that rs10868366 and rs7019241 in GOLPH2 and rs3826656 in near gene 5' region of CD33 are significantly associated with SAD in the north Chinese Han population."

It is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children due to the frequent occurrence of coronary artery lesions (CALs). Recently, a C allele of rs28493229 (G/C) in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase C (ITPKC) gene was found to significantly increase the risk for KD/CALs in Japanese population. It is important to confirm such finding in Chinese population to enable prognosis and personalized therapy for KD."
22158116,22158116,A common missense single nucleotide polymorphism in the E-selectin gene is significantly associated with essential hypertension in the Han population but only weakly associated in the Uygur population.,"Experimental and clinical observations suggest that E-selectin could have an important role in essential hypertension (EH), but the relationship between common E-selectin variants and EH has not been extensively studied in the Chinese population. In this study, we explored the association between two common variants in the E-selectin gene (rs5361A/C and rs5355C/T) and EH in the Uygur, Kazakh and Han populations in the Xinjiang area. A case-control study was conducted to explore the association between these two single-nucleotide polymorphisms and EH in a large sample size, including 941 EH subjects (309 Uygur, 264 Kazakh and 368 Han individuals) and 924 control subjects (300 Uygur, 275 Kazakh and 349 Han individuals). Univariate analysis showed that the rs5361 A/C polymorphism was significantly associated with EH in the Uygur (P=0.002) and Han (P=3.6 × 10(-7)) populations. The CC genotype of this SNP was present only in patients with EH in all of the three nationalities studied. Han individuals who carry the CC genotype of rs5361 were more susceptible to EH, according to the dominant models (P=1.13 × 10(-4), odds ratio=3.812, 95% confidence interval: 1.685-7.792), but there was no association of genotype with EH for the other ethnicities. No significant difference in rs5355 C/T polymorphism rate was found between the EH and control groups. Our results indicate that the common variant rs5361 is strongly associated with EH in Han individuals and weakly associated in Uygur individuals. The CC genotype of rs5361 might be an independent risk factor for EH among Uygur, Kazakh and Han individuals in the Xinjiang area."

However, whether they are associated with AS in East Asian population remains unidentified. Here, we conducted a new case-control study investigating this relationship in Chinese Han population and then performed a meta-analysis in East Asian population. The Chinese Han study included 200 cases and 200 controls. Genotyping was completed using the chip-based matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Allelic associations were analysed using contingency tables. In the meta-analysis, 1384 cases and 1710 controls from five different studies and the new Chinese Han study were combined using Review Manager software Version 5.1.1. Mantel-Haenszel test was used to calculate fixed effects pooled ORs. No association with AS was observed in the Chinese Han study. Meta-analysis showed that no SNP was significantly associated with AS in East Asian population. In conclusion, we found no evidence for association between IL-23R and AS in East Asian population. Major attention should be paid to other genes belonged to IL-23 signalling pathway network in the future."
22125610,22125610,"The fat mass and obesity associated gene, FTO, is also associated with osteoporosis phenotypes.","Obesity and osteoporosis are closely correlated genetically. FTO gene has been consistently identified to be associated with obesity phenotypes. A recent study reported that the mice lacking Fto could result in lower bone mineral density (BMD). Thus, we hypothesize that the FTO gene might be also important for osteoporosis phenotypes. To test for such a hypothesis, we performed an association analyses to investigate the relationship between SNPs in FTO and BMD at both hip and spine. A total of 141 SNPs were tested in two independent Chinese populations (818 and 809 unrelated Han subjects, respectively) and a Caucasian population (2,286 unrelated subjects). Combining the two Chinese samples, we identified 6 SNPs in FTO to be significantly associated with hip BMD after multiple testing adjustments, with the combined P values ranged from 4.99 × 10⁻⁴-1.47 × 10⁻⁴. These 6 SNPs are all located at the intron 8 of FTO and in high linkage disequilibrium. Each copy of the minor allele of each SNP was associated with increased hip BMD values with the effect size (beta) of ∼0.025 and ∼0.015 in the Chinese sample 1 and 2, respectively. However, none of these 6 SNPs showed significant association signal in the Caucasian sample, by presenting some extent of ethnic difference. Our findings, together with the prior biological evidence, suggest that the FTO gene might be a new candidate for BMD variation and osteoporosis in Chinese populations."

22108846,22108846,Polymorphism in pre-miR-30c contributes to gastric cancer risk in a Chinese population.,"To explore the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) A/G in pre-miR-30c and gastric cancer risk and to assess various genotypes that affected the survival of patients, we performed a hospital-based, case-control study in Inner Mongolia autonomous region of China. A total of 240 gastric cancer patients and 240 age- and sex-matched cancer-free controls collected from 2006 to 2011 were enrolled in this study. Polymorphism rs928508 in pre-miR-30c was analyzed by TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. The expression of mature miR-30c was detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR in 48 gastric cancer specimens. Survival analysis was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The genotype frequencies of pre-miR-30c A/G in gastric cancer patients were obviously different from those in the controls (P = 0.022). AA genotype carriers were associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer compared with GG genotype (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-3.15, P = 0.029). Moreover, the gastric cancer risk especially elevated in older individuals (aged >60 years), males, nonsmokers, and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-infected individuals (adjusted OR = 2.66, 95% CI: 1.38-5.13, P = 0.004; adjusted OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.10-3.27, P = 0.022; adjusted OR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.12-3.35, P = 0.018; adjusted OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.08-3.10, P = 0.024, respectively). Further stratified analysis indicated that AA genotype facilitated developing of gastric cancer with lymph node metastasis (adjusted OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.07-4.64, P = 0.032). Expression analysis detected that rs928508 AA showed a significantly increased level of mature miR-30c compared with GG or AG/GG genotype (P = 0.011 or P = 0.013). Patients with AA genotype were associated with unfavorable outcome in overall survival compared with AG/GG genotype (Log rank 5.848, P = 0.016). This study demonstrates that pre-miR-30c A/G polymorphism may be associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer in a Chinese population through altering mature miR-30c expression. However, their role as novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of gastric diseases still needs to be systematically evaluated."
22116073,22116073,Association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms of DNMT3L and infertility with azoospermia in Chinese men.,"The gene for DNA methyltransferase 3-like protein (DNMT3L) is essential for normal spermatogenesis and may be involved with spermatogenetic impairment and male infertility. To explore the possible association between the DNMT3L gene and male infertility, this study investigated allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies of three single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci, rs2070565, rs2276248 and rs7354779, of DNMT3L in 233 infertile patients with azoospermia and 249 fertile controls from a population of Chinese men using polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism. Results showed that the frequencies of allele A (20.6% versus 14.9%; P = 0.022) and the allele A carrier (GA + AA; 37.8% versus 28.1%; P = 0.027) in azoospermic patients were significantly higher than those in controls at the rs2070565 locus. The haplotype AAA frequency was significantly higher (18.1% versus 12.4%; P = 0.02) while the haplotype GAA frequency was significantly lower (53.2% versus 62.1%; P = 0.007) in infertile patients compared with fertile controls. These results indicated that SNP rs2070565, as well as haplotypes AAA and GAA, may be associated with male infertility and suggest that DNMT3L may contribute to azoospermia susceptibility in humans."

A single nucleotide polymorphism of the EGF gene +61G/A in the 5'-untranslated region has been reported to be associated with susceptibility to glioma. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential association between EGF +61G/A and brain glioma in a Chinese population. A case-control study involving 180 patients with glioma and 360 controls was done. Polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment-length polymorphism assay was used to analyze the EGF +61G/A genotypes. Patients with glioma had a significantly higher frequency of AA genotype (odds ratio, 2.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.20, 4.21; p=0.01] than controls. When stratified by histologic features and World Health Organization grade of glioma, distribution of each genotype did not significantly differ. Our data suggested that the EGF +61G AA genotype was associated with a higher glioma risk in a Chinese population. This finding is in contrast with previous studies that reported the G allele as a risk factor for glioma in white patients."

The etiology of GD and GO  may be multifactorial, but the immune response plays a central role. Many  studies have reported that IL-21 has crucial roles in autoimmune diseases. We  examined whether IL-21 is associated with the development of GD and GO. The  serum concentration of IL-21 was tested in 40 primary GD patients, 42 treated  GO patients and 24 healthy controls. Our data show that the serum level of  IL-21 is associated with the development of GD. We also made an association study  with the IL-21 gene polymorphisms rs4833837, rs907715 and rs13143866 in a comparison  of 633 patients and 612 healthy controls from the Chinese population. This  case-control association study demonstrated that rs907715 SNP is significantly  associated with GD, while the rs13143866 A allele is significantly associated  with GO. The haplotypes A-G-G and A-A-A were found at higher and lower  frequencies, respectively, in GD patients, suggesting a protective role for  A-A-A. However, there were no significant differences in the frequencies of  these haplotypes between the GO patients and the control group.

Therefore, we used PRDX6 as an important candidate gene for meat quality according to its physiological and biochemical function. Partial coding sequence of porcine PRDX6 was isolated and two potenial SNPs, one at 417 bp (C/T) and the other at 423 bp (A/G), were found in the fourth exon by comparison of the obtained sequence from different pig breeds. In order to explore the relationship between PRDX6 polymorphism and meat quality, genetic variation and trait association of these two SNPs were separately performed in 6 purebred pig population and 247 F2 ""Large White x Meishan"" resource population by pyrosequencing. The results showed that allele C was predominant in western pig breeds, while allele T was predominant in Chinese indigenous breeds at 417 bp (C/T). This SNP was significantly associated with the intramuscular fat and water moisture (P < 0.05). The A/G mutation at 423 bp was significantly associated with drip water rate, water holding capacity, intramuscular fat, and water moisture (P < 0.05). Allele A was predominant in western pig breeds, while allele G was predominant in Chinese indigenous breeds. These two SNPs were likely to be important markers affecting meat quality traits (especially the muscle tenderness)."

We hypothesize that polymorphisms in the functional region of VHL may influence susceptibility to prostate cancer (PCa). We genotyped a potentially functional polymorphism (rs779805) in 5' UTR region of VHL in a case-control study of 665 PCa patients and 715 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population using the Taqman assay. The genetic associations between the incidence and progression of PCa were assessed by logistic regression. We observed that the rs779805 A>G polymorphism was significantly associated with risk for PCa. Compared with the AA genotype, the AG and AG/GG genotypes were associated with decreased risk of PCa (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.62-0.99, and adjusted OR=0.76, 95% CI=0.61-0.95, respectively). Further, this decreased risk was more pronounced in the subgroups of nonsmokers (OR=0.73, 95% CI=0.54-0.98), nondrinkers (OR=0.70, 95% CI=0.54-0.91) and patients without family history of cancer (OR=0.72, 95% CI=0.57-0.92). In addition, the decreased risk associated with rs779805 variant genotypes (AG/GG) was more pronounced among the prostate specific antigen (PSA)>20 ng/mL subgroup (OR=0.68, 95% CI=0.49-0.95). Our findings suggest that the rs779805 A>G polymorphism in VHL may confer susceptibility to PCa in the Chinese population."

This study evaluated the association of WRN Leu1074Phe (rs1801195), a common missense single nucleotide polymorphism in WRN, with prostate cancer susceptibility in Chinese subjects. One hundred and forty-seven prostate cancer patients and 111 male cancer-free control subjects from 3 university hospitals in China were included. Blood samples were obtained from each subject, and the single nucleotide polymorphism WRN Leu1074Phe was genotyped by using a Snapshot assay. The results showed that WRN Leu1074Phe was associated with the risk of prostate cancer in Chinese men and that the TG/GG genotype displayed a decreased prevalence of prostate cancer compared with the TT genotype (OR＝0.58, 95%CI:0.35-0.97, p＝0.039). Through stratified analysis, more significant associations were revealed for the TG/GG genotype in the subgroup with diagnosis age ≤ 72 yr (OR＝0.27, 95%CI:0.12-0.61, p＝0.002) and in patients with localized diseases (OR＝0.36, 95%CI:0.19-0.70, p＝0.003). However, no statistically significant difference was found in the subgroup with age ＞72 yr or in patients with advanced diseases. We concluded that the genetic variant Leu1074Phe in the DNA repair gene WRN might play a role in the risk of prostate cancer in Chinese subjects."
22030336,22030336,Six novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms in SPAG11 gene and their association with sperm quality traits in Chinese Holstein bulls.,"Sperm-associated antigen 11 (SPAG11) is predominant in the male reproductive tract. Similar to β-defensin, aside from its antibacterial activity, SPAG11 also has an important role in male reproductive function. In the present study, the association of bovine SPAG11 gene polymorphism with sperm quality traits was examined, including ejaculate volume, sperm concentration, fresh sperm motility, post-thaw cryopreserved sperm motility, and deformity rate of bull semen. Six novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the SPGA11 gene were investigated in 426 normal mature Chinese Holstein bulls using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), created restriction site-PCR (CRS-PCR), and DNA sequencing methods. Linkage disequilibrium analysis showed that g.1306G>A and g.1454G>A (SNP-1), and g.16904G>T, g.16974C>T, and g.17000A>G (SNP-2) are completely linked, respectively. Correlation analysis showed the SNP-2 marker had a marked effect on fresh sperm motility and sperm concentration (P<0.05). SNP-3 g.22696T>C had a marked effect on post-thaw cryopreserved sperm motility (P<0.05) and deformity rate (P<0.01). However, the presence of SNP-1 was not correlated with the sperm production traits (P>0.05). Furthermore, association analyses of the 8 haplotypes constructed from the 17 combined haplotypes and reproductive traits showed that the bulls with the combined haplotype H5H6 (GGT/TTC) have the highest ejaculate volumes and the bulls with combined haplotypes H1H1 (AAT/TTT) and H1H6 (AGT/TTC) had the highest fresh and post-thaw sperm motilities, respectively. These results indicate that new molecular markers associated with sperm quality traits can be used in marker-assisted selection in bull breeding programs."

For parametric linkage analysis, an assuming autosomal recessive trait was used with full penetrance, and Affymetrix ""Asian"" allele frequencies. The NPL score of 2.698 (P=0.0156) and LOD score of 2.119 (θ=0) were obtained on chromosome 1q25.2a for one marker (rs726252). The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs726252 locates in the region of fifth intron of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A2 (PAPPA2). Although neither LOD nor NPL scores of rs726252 has exceeded 3.0, several researches have demonstrated that PAPPA2 have important consequences for the development of the fetus and normal postnatal growth. To further evaluate this possible association, in the present study, we examined the genetic association of rs726252 in PAPPA2 gene with sporadic DDH in Han Chinese population using case-control study, including 310 patients with sporadic DDH and 487 control subjects, and found a significant association between PAPPA2 and DDH."
22006801,22006801,[Association of RELN SNP rs7341475 with schizophrenia in the Chinese population].,"Schizophrenia is a common and complex psychiatric disorder. Significant evidence has suggested that genetic factors play pivotal roles in the etiology of schizophrenia. More than 100 schizophrenia candidate genes have been reported; however, many of them do not have satisfactory replications among different populations. Among these genes, RELN is thought to be associated with schizophrenia in many populations, suggesting it is a real risk gene for this disorder. Identified in the GWAS study, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7341475, located in intron 4 of RELN, has been successfully replicated in subsequent investigations, implying its potential contribution to schizophrenia susceptibility. To investigate the association of rs7341475 with schizophrenia in Chinese populations, a case-control association analysis was conducted with samples from Yuxi (400 cases and 400 controls) in southwestern China. The results do not indicate any association of rs7341475 with schizophrenia, which suggests it is not a risk SNP for schizophrenia in Han Chinese."
22019503,22019503,Association of polymorphisms in pre-miRNA with inflammatory biomarkers in rheumatoid arthritis in the Chinese Han population.,"The aim of this study was to detect the association between 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs2910164 G>C and rs3746444 T>C, in pre-miRNA (hsa-mir-146a and hsa-mir-499) and the chronic inflammation in the Chinese Han population with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Two hundred sixty-two Han Chinese patients with RA were recruited in this study. The SNPs were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism. C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and the plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) were measured. There was a significant difference in the levels of CRP and ESR among different genotypes in rs3746444 (p = 0.031 and p = 0.047, respectively). The heterozygote CT had significantly higher levels of CRP and ESR compared with homozygotes CC and TT. No significant association was observed between the SNP rs2910164 and the levels of CRP, ESR, IL-6, TNF-α, and TGF-β1 (all p > 0.05). The results of this study provided the first evidence that the SNP rs3746444 in pre-miR-499 could affect the inflammatory reaction in patients with RA. The findings were significant and might contribute to the clinical assessment of inflammatory activity, which in turn may influence therapeutic decision making."

21993378,21993378,Is the conserved mammalian region of ZNF804A locus associated with schizophrenia? A population-based genetics analysis.,"Recently, several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have reproduced the significant association of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1344706 (located in intron 2 of the zinc finger protein 804A (ZNF804A) on chromosome 2q32.1) with schizophrenia. Bioinformatic analysis of the chromosome segment around rs1344706 suggests that a short conserved mammalian region exists approximately 3kb downstream of rs1344706. In the present work, we studied all SNPs in this conserved mammalian region and performed genetic analyses on samples from Chinese schizophrenia patients (n = 516) and compared control subjects (n = 520). Significant association between an allele of rs13423388 and schizophrenia was found (P = 0.0012). Haplotype analysis of the three SNPs rs4666998, rs13423388, and rs56280129 showed significant associations with schizophrenia (global P = 0.00001). Furthermore, we performed a four-SNP haplotype analysis which included the SNPs from the three-SNP haplotype analysis and rs1344706 (global P = 0.0005), and found that haplotype GCCG was associated with schizophrenia (P = 0.003). In summary, the present study adds new evidence for an association between the conserved mammalian region of the ZNF804A gene and schizophrenia. Further research is needed to clarify the transcriptional regulation of ZNF804A gene and to relate this to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia."
21993774,21993774,High myopia is not associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms in             the COL2A1 gene in the Chinese population.,"Association studies have revealed that the rs1635529 polymorphism in the COL2A1 (collagen, type Ⅱ, α 1) gene may be a potential candidate for myopia development and may be associated with myopia in Caucasians. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of high myopia with 5 polymorphisms including rs1635529 in COL2A1 in a Chinese population. Genomic DNA samples were selected from our Genomic DNA Repository for Myopia. A total of 581 high myopia individuals (refraction ≤-6.00D, spherical equivalent) and 384 normal controls (refraction between -0.50D and +2.00D, spherical equivalent) from a Han Chinese cohort participated in the association study. Allelic discrimination assay was performed on five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1635529, rs60542319, rs1635530, rs1635531 and rs954326) in COL2A1 by direct sequence analysis of polymerase chain reaction products. The genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies of the SNPs between cases and controls were compared by Chi-square test for association analysis. Based on the results, SNPs at rs1635530 and rs1635531 were found to be monomorphic in all subjects. There was no statistically significant difference in genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies for the other three SNPs (rs1635529, rs60542319 and rs954326) between the high myopia group and the control group. We do not find evidence to support an association of SNP rs1635529 in COL2A1 with high myopia in the Chinese population studied, nor of the other two SNPs (rs60542319 and rs954326)."
21989058,21989058,Association of 8q22.3 locus in Chinese Han with idiopathic premature ovarian failure (POF).,"Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a complex heritable disorder known to be caused by chromosomal abnormalities and to date a limited number of known mutations, often autosomal. We sought to identify additional genetic loci associated with POF by performing the first large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS). GWAS, using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 chip, was conducted in an initial discovery set of 391 well-documented (follicle-stimulating hormone >40 IU/ml) Chinese Han POF patients, compared with 895 unrelated Chinese female controls. A replication study on the most significant loci was then performed in an independent set of 400 cases and 800 controls. Suggestive significant associations were observed at 8q22.3. Replication of eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs10464815, rs10808365, rs3847152, rs3847153, rs3847154, rs3843552, rs10955242, rs3843555) (P ≤ 3.86 × 10(-6)) was confirmed in verification sets. No specific candidate gene was found in the immediate region of 8q22.3. This GWAS, involving by far the largest sample of POF cases accumulated to date, revealed heretofore unrecognized association between POF and a novel genetic locus or region of unknown nature on 8q22.3. We speculate existence of a long-distance regulatory region that has relevance to the control of ovarian differentiation or oogenesis. Given failure to find association with any of the other autosomal regions known to harbor genes causing ovarian failure, our findings also underscore the likelihood of considerable genetic and etiologic heterogeneity in POF and the need for additional approaches like whole-genome sequencing."
21988350,21988350,"Associations of fibroblast growth factor 21 gene 3' untranslated region single-nucleotide polymorphisms with metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes in a Han Chinese population.","Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) is a novel regulator for metabolic syndrome (MetS), diabetes, and obesity. However, no study has been performed on the association of these diseases with FGF-21 gene polymorphism. The aim of the study was to investigate the association of 3' untranslated region (UTR) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FGF-21 gene with MetS, obesity, and diabetes in the Han Chinese population. A total of 291 subjects were recruited from the Han Chinese population in Sichuan province. The genotypes of FGF-21 were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The genotypes were confirmed by sequencing. No polymorphisms were found in rs11665841 (1 of 291) and rs3745706 (2 of 291). We did not find an association between genotype frequencies of SNP rs11665896 and lipid concentration, glucose concentration, or blood pressure. The TG/GG genotype relative to the TT genotype had an age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio of 1.41 for MetS (p=0.149), 1.84 (p=0.016) for obesity (body mass index ≥25 kg/m(2)), and 1.19 (p=0.492) for diabetes.

21968728,21968728,Lack of an association between a single nucleotide polymorphism in the bovine myogenic determination 1 (MyoD1) gene and meat quality traits in indigenous Chinese cattle breeds.,"The  myogenic determination 1 (MyoD1) gene is a member of the MyoD gene family. It  encodes for skeletal muscle-specific transcription factors containing highly  conserved basic helix-loop-helix regions that perform important roles in the  initiation, maintenance, and regulation of phenotypic traits. We investigated a  new single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the MyoD1 gene to evaluate whether  this polymorphism affects meat quality traits in five Chinese indigenous cattle  breeds, namely Qinchuan (QC), Xia-Nan (XN), Nan-yang (NY), Luxi (LX), and  Jia-xian red (JXR). A C→G transversion at position 624 was detected in exon 1  of the MyoD1 gene; it causes an amino acid substitution ((624)serine/(624)cysteine).  Least squares analysis showed that this SNP is not significantly associated  with back fat thickness, eye muscle area, intramuscular fat, or marbling. The  A/B allelic frequencies in the five breeds were 0.810/0.189, 0.779/0.220,  0.768/0.231, 0.820/0.180, and 0.801/0.198, respectively. Based on the χ(2) test,  the genotype distributions of four cattle breeds (LX, NY, QC, and XN) did not  agree with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P < 0.05); one breed (JXR) did not  deviate significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P > 0.05). The  genotypic frequencies among all five cattle breeds showed moderate diversity  (0.25 < polymorphism information content < 0.5). We concluded that the  C624G SNP of the MyoD1 gene does not influence meat quality traits in  indigenous Chinese cattle breeds; however, this SNP could be included in breed  composition and population admixture analyses due to the marked differences in  allelic frequencies among these five breeds."
21968727,21968727,Association of eNOS gene polymorphisms with essential hypertension in the Han population in southwestern China.,"Endothelial  nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) plays an important role in maintaining blood  pressure homeostasis and vascular integrity. Polymorphisms in the eNOS gene  have been found to be associated with hypertension in different human  populations, including Northern and Southern Chinese Han populations. To  examine the relationship of three eNOS gene polymorphisms, T-786C  (rs2070744), G894T (rs1799983), and G10T (rs7830), with hypertension in the Han  population in southwestern China, we carried out a study of the genotypes of  three SNPs in 510 hypertensive and 510 normotensive subjects from the Yunnan  Province by using PCR-RFLP and sequencing. Our SNP analyses showed that the  distribution of the T-786C polymorphism did not differ between patients and  controls, and that G894T and G10T are significantly associated with  hypertension in females, adjusted for covariates. Compared with the other  haplotypes, haplotype H1 (TGG), carrying protective 10G and 894G alleles,  significantly decreased the risk of increased essential hypertension in  females, with an odds ratio of 0.68 (P = 10(-5)). These results  suggest that the eNOS polymorphism is one of the factors contributing to  the predisposition for essential hypertension in the Han population in  southwestern China."
21959049,21959049,Association between single nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosome 17q and the risk of prostate cancer in a Chinese population.,"In European populations, 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 17q, 3 SNPs on 17q12, and 4 SNPs on 17q24.3 were recently identified to be closely related to the risk of prostate cancer by a genome-wide association study. In Japanese populations, the correlation between 2 SNPs on 17q and the risk of prostate cancer and tumor aggressiveness was also confirmed by a large-scale experiment. However, whether 17q is associated with prostate cancer and its clinical manifestations in Chinese populations is still unknown. Therefore, we conducted a case-control study in a northern Chinese population and tested 2 SNPs, rs4430796 and rs1859962, on 17q in 124 prostate cancer patients and 111 controls using polymerase chain reaction-high resolution melting curve (PCR-HRM) combined with sequencing. We analyzed the association of the 2 SNPs with the risk of prostate cancer as well as patients' lifestyles, onset ages, Gleason scores, PSA levels, and pathologic stages. We found a significant difference in the G allele of SNP rs1859962 (P = 0.035, OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.03-2.21) but not in the rs4430796 genotype frequency or allele frequency distribution between prostate cancer patients and the controls (P > 0.05). Neither of the SNPs was significantly associated with the onset age, Gleason score, PSA level, pathologic stage, or other clinical indicators of patients with prostate cancer (P > 0.05). Our results show that polymorphism of the G allele of SNP rs1859962 is associated with the risk of prostate cancer in a Chinese population."

In this study, we investigated the association of four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the TIM-3 gene with RA susceptibility in Chinese Hui and Han groups. Using restriction fragment length or sequence-specific primer-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), patients with RA and nonarthritis control individuals from these two ethnicities were analysed for SNPs of -1541 C>T, -882 T>C, -574 T>G and +4259 G>T, in the TIM-3 gene. Our results demonstrated that the polymorphisms of +4259 G>T SNP of TIM-3 gene was associated with the RA susceptibility in both the Hui (P < 0.01) and Han populations (P < 0.05). However, the -1541 C>T and -574 T>G SNPs were distinctly associated with RA for the Hui and Han populations, respectively. In addition, haplotype analysis found no statistically differences in the distribution of nine detected haplotype frequency between patients with RA and controls in this study (P > 0.05). These findings suggest that polymorphism of +4259 G>T in TIM-3 gene may be one of the most important genetic factors associated with the RA susceptibility among different populations, and genetic variations of TIM-3 gene contribute to RA susceptibility among different populations."

The  human sonic hedgehog (SHH) gene is located in the 7q36 region, which  was linked to male sexual orientation in a previous genome-wide association  study. SHH is known to play an important role in embryo patterning,  and there is evidence connecting it to sexual orientation. In this study, we  performed an association analysis of the SHH tag single nucleotide  polymorphism rs9333613 in 361 subjects and 319 Chinese male controls. We find  a significant difference in genotype and allele distribution between  identified homosexuals and heterosexual control subjects, suggesting that the  SHH gene could potentially be associated with male sexual  orientation."

21947420,21947420,Genome-wide association study identifies HMGN3 locus for spine bone size variation in Chinese.,"Bone size (BS) is one of the major risk factors for osteoporotic fractures. BS variation is genetically determined to a substantial degree with heritability over 50%, but specific genes underlying variation of BS are still largely unknown. To identify specific genes for BS in Chinese, initial genome-wide association scan (GWAS) study and follow-up replication study were performed. In initial GWAS study, a group of 12 contiguous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s, which span a region of ~25 kb and locate at the upstream of HMGN3 gene (high-mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 3), achieved moderate association signals for spine BS, with P values ranging from 6.2E-05 to 1.8E-06. In the follow-up replication study, eight of the 12 SNPs were detected suggestive replicate associations with BS in 1,728 unrelated female Caucasians, which have well-known differences from Chinese in ethnic genetic background. The SNPs in the region of HMGN3 gene formed a tightly combined haplotype block in both Chinese and Caucasians. The results suggest that the genomic region containing HMGN3 gene may be associated with spine BS in Chinese."

The object of this study was to investigate the association of PD-1 polymorphisms with aplastic anemia (AA) in the Chinese Han population. In a case-control association study, three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), PD-1.3 G/A, PD-1.5 C/T, and PD-1.9 T/C, were genotyped in 166 AA patients and 264 healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. All genotype distributions in the patients and the controls were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The associations of genotypes and alleles with AA were analyzed. No differences in genotype and allele frequencies were elucidated for SNPs in intron 4 and exon 5. In conclusion, we show no association of selected SNPs in PDCD1 gene with AA in the Chinese Han population."
21927946,21927946,Association study of the KCNJ3 gene as a susceptibility candidate for schizophrenia in the Chinese population.,"We recently reported the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of schizophrenia in the Japanese population. In that study, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs3106653) in the KCNJ3 (potassium inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 3) gene located at 2q24.1 showed association with schizophrenia in two independent sample sets. KCNJ3, also termed GIRK1 or Kir3.1, is a member of the G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K(+) channel (GIRK) group. GIRKs are widely distributed in the brain and play an important role in regulating neural excitability through the activation of various G protein-coupled receptors. In this study, we set out to examine this association using a different population. We first performed a gene-centric association study of the KCNJ3 gene, by genotyping 38 tagSNPs in the Chinese population. We detected nine SNPs that displayed significant association with schizophrenia (lowest P = 0.0016 for rs3106658, Global significance = 0.036). The initial marker SNP (rs3106653) examined in our prior GWAS in the Japanese population also showed nominally significant association in the Chinese population (P = 0.028). Next, we analyzed transcript levels in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of postmortem brains from patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and from healthy controls, using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. We found significantly lower KCNJ3 expression in postmortem brains from schizophrenic and bipolar patients compared with controls. These data suggest that the KCNJ3 gene is genetically associated with schizophrenia in Asian populations and add further evidence to the ""channelopathy theory of psychiatric illnesses""."

21917241,21917241,Lack of effect of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism on early onset schizophrenia in Chinese Han population.,"Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder with high heritability. Schizophrenic patients with early-age onset tend to have a greater genetic component and may be an attractive subpopulation for genetic studies. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is considered a candidate gene for schizophrenia. A single nucleotide polymorphism (BDNF Val66Met) was reported to be associated with schizophrenia, although discrepancy remains. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and schizophrenia using an early onset sample in the Chinese Han population. Our sample consisted of 353 schizophrenic patients with onset before age 18 and 394 healthy controls. All subjects were of an ethnically homogenous Han Chinese origin. No significant differences of genotype or allele distribution were identified between the patients and controls. However, the Met allele was significantly associated with an earlier age of onset in male schizophrenic patients (Kaplan-Meier log-rank test P=0.005), but not in females (P=0.289). The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism has an important effect on the age of onset of schizophrenia in a gender-specific manner. This may represent a significant genetic clue for the etiology of schizophrenia and thus, further studies are required to uncover the exact role of BDNF in the development of schizophrenia."
21923761,21923761,Association study of myelin transcription factor 1-like polymorphisms with schizophrenia in Han Chinese population.,"Schizophrenia (SZ) is characterized by a variety of complex positive, negative and cognitive symptoms that are differentially expressed in individual patients. Variability in symptom presentation indicates that multiple genes, many involved in neurodevelopment, contribute to the etiology of SZ. The myelin transcription factor 1-like (MYT1L) gene encodes the MYT1L protein that participates in several neurodevelopment pathways. The copy number variant of MYT1L gene is associated with SZ, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MYT1L contribute to major depressive disorder. To explore the association of MYT1L polymorphisms with SZ, we examined six SNPs of MYT1L in a Han Chinese population consisting of 528 paranoid schizophrenic patients and 528 healthy subjects. Our results showed that rs17039584 was significantly associated with SZ (A>G), even after Bonferroni correction. When subjects were divided by gender, the rs10190125 allele and genotype remained significantly associated with SZ in female patients. Moreover, we found that rs6742365 was associated with a family history of SZ in females. Other SNPs did not achieve statistical significance for SZ but were associated with individual phenotypes, as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) inventory. Our findings suggest that MYT1L may represent a susceptibility gene for SZ in the Han Chinese population and show that a specific SNP may increase susceptibility in females."

We conducted a four-stage GWAS including 17 153 cases and 16 943 controls among East-Asian women to search for new genetic risk factors for breast cancer. After analyzing 684 457 SNPs in 2062 cases and 2066 controls (Stage I), we selected for replication among 5969 Chinese women (4146 cases and 1823 controls) the top 49 SNPs that had neither been reported previously nor were in strong linkage disequilibrium with reported SNPs (Stage II). Three SNPs were further evaluated in up to 13 152 Chinese and Japanese women (6436 cases and 6716 controls) (Stage III). Finally, two SNPs were evaluated in 10 847 Korean women (4509 cases and 6338 controls) (Stage IV). SNP rs10822013 on chromosome 10q21.2, located in the zinc finger protein 365 (ZNF365) gene, showed a consistent association with breast cancer risk in all four stages with a combined per-risk allele odds ratio of 1.10 (95% CI: 1.07-1.14) (P-value for trend = 5.87 × 10(-9)). In vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated the potential functional significance of rs10822013. Our results strongly implicate rs10822013 at 10q21.2 as a genetic risk variant for breast cancer among East-Asian women."

21915163,21915163,CTLA-4 gene polymorphism and the risk of systemic lupus erythematosus in the Chinese population.,"Several variants of CTLA-4 have been reported to be associated with susceptibility systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); however, findings have been inconsistent across different populations. Using a case-control study design, we have investigated the role of CTLA-4 polymorphism at positions -1661 and -1722 on SLE susceptibility in our Chinese SLE population in central China's Hubei province. Samples were collected from 148 SLE patients and 170 healthy controls. Polymerase chain reaction restriction fragments length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used to analyze the genotypes of the two sites. Statistically significant difference was observed in genotypes for -1722, but not for -1661. The frequency of the T allele on the -1722 SNP was significantly increased in SLE patients: 57.8% versus 40.6% in controls (P < 0.001, OR = 2.002). While the detected C allele frequency in the controls was significantly elevated in comparison to that in the SLE patients (59.4% versus 42.2%). On the contrary, no association was found between SLE and CTLA-4 polymorphism at position -1661."
21881829,21881829,PEMT G523A (V175M) is associated with sporadic Alzheimer's disease in a Chinese population.,"There is evidence that increased concentrations of circulating homocysteine are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) is an important catalyst involved in the production of homocysteine. We investigated the association of a functional single nucleotide polymorphism (rs7946) in PEMT with sporadic AD risk in a Han Chinese population that included 386 AD patients and 366 controls. PEMT G523A was genotyped by either sequencing or PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The plasma homocysteine concentrations of 210 subjects were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Significant higher frequency of the A allele was detected in AD cases than in controls (A vs. G, p = 0.007, OR = 1.482, 95% CI 1.114-1.972). After adjusting for gender, age/age at onset, and APOE ε4 status, logistic analysis showed rs7946 was associated with AD in a dominant model (AA + GA vs. GG, p = 0.007, OR = 1.596, 95% CI 1.138-2.240). When stratified by APOE ε4 status or gender, the significant difference was only observed in the APOE ε4 non-carriers and in the female subjects, respectively. We did not find a relationship of this polymorphism with plasma homocysteine levels. These results suggested that PEMT G523A is associated with AD and that the A allele is an APOE ε4-independent risk factor for AD among Han Chinese women."

21862460,21862460,Diffuse thin glomerular basement membrane in association with Fabry disease in a Chinese female patient.,"We report a 41-year-old Chinese female with Fabry disease and diffuse thinning of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). The patient presented with peripheral edema, mild proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, normal renal function, hypertension and tinnitus. Family screening showed that her daughter had microscopic hematuria, tinnitus and neuropathic pain. Renal biopsy of the proband showed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with cytoplasmic vacuolization of the glomerular visceral epithelial cells by light microscopy. Laminated myelin inclusions in some of the glomerular podocytes, parietal epithelia, distal tubular epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells along with diffuse thinning of the GBM (mean thickness of GBM: 216 ± 31 nm) were identified by electron microscopy. Genetic analysis detected a de novo novel GLA mutation, 1208 ins 21 bp, while a new variant of COL4A3 SNP M1209I was carried by mother and daughter as well as the proband's father (I-1) and one sister (II-4). The coexistence of thinned GBM should be considered in patients with Fabry disease-manifested familial hematuria."

21834910,21834910,Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARD) genetic variation and type 2 diabetes in middle-aged Chinese women.,"Animal studies have shown that the peroxime proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARD) gene regulates glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Genetic variation in the PPARD gene might affect physical endurance and has been associated with obesity. We investigated the independent and modifying effect of variants in the PPARD gene with exercise participation and body mass index (BMI) on type 2 diabetes (T2D), using data from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of middle-aged women living in Shanghai, China, with 1019 T2D cases and 1709 controls. The genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 platform. Imputation was used to determine missing genotypes. Participation in exercise was assessed by a questionnaire. Anthropometric variables were measured by trained interviewers. The association between polymorphisms and T2D was assessed by logistic regression analyses. The combined effects of polymorphisms in the PPARD gene with exercise participation and BMI on T2D risk was assessed by conducting stratified analysis with exercise participation and BMI categories. No significant associations between PPARD and T2D were found in either genotyped or imputed SNPs and no effect modification between exercise participation and PPARD genetic variation was found, suggesting that PPARD is not a risk factor for T2D in this population."
21861697,21861697,Association between two genetic variants in miRNA and primary liver cancer risk in the Chinese population.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the growth and development of human beings. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within miRNA could change their production or affinity with target genes, thus leading to malignant diseases. This case-control study conducted in Western China aimed to explore the relationship between polymorphisms in miR-146a (rs2910164 G>C) and miR-499 (rs3746444 T>C) and primary liver cancers in the Chinese population. 186 primary liver cancer cases and 483 healthy controls were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. No significant differences were observed between distributions of the two SNPs and susceptibility of primary liver cancer or diverse clinicopathologic features. However, we found that patients with genotype CG of the SNP in miR-146a tended to have earlier onset and better liver function than patients with genotype CC (average age: 49.9 vs. 54.9, p=0.038; average Child-Pugh grade: 5.55 vs. 6.15, p=0.021), and further analysis showed that patients who had at least one G allele were diagnosed at an earlier age (average age: 49.6 vs. 54.9, p=0.022) and had better liver function (average Child-Pugh grade:5.60 vs. 6.15, p=0.026). Our data suggested lack of association between the two SNPs and primary liver cancer risk, though, interestingly, the miR-146a SNP may influence the age of onset and Child-Pugh grade."
21829377,21829377,Genetic loci associated with plasma phospholipid n-3 fatty acids: a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies from the CHARGE Consortium.,"Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can derive from diet or from α-linolenic acid (ALA) by elongation and desaturation. We investigated the association of common genetic variation with plasma phospholipid levels of the four major n-3 PUFAs by performing genome-wide association studies in five population-based cohorts comprising 8,866 subjects of European ancestry. Minor alleles of SNPs in FADS1 and FADS2 (desaturases) were associated with higher levels of ALA (p = 3 x 10⁻⁶⁴) and lower levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, p = 5 x 10⁻⁵⁸) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, p = 4 x 10⁻¹⁵⁴). Minor alleles of SNPs in ELOVL2 (elongase) were associated with higher EPA (p = 2 x 10⁻¹²) and DPA (p = 1 x 10⁻⁴³) and lower docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, p = 1 x 10⁻¹⁵). In addition to genes in the n-3 pathway, we identified a novel association of DPA with several SNPs in GCKR (glucokinase regulator, p = 1 x 10⁻⁸). We observed a weaker association between ALA and EPA among carriers of the minor allele of a representative SNP in FADS2 (rs1535), suggesting a lower rate of ALA-to-EPA conversion in these subjects. In samples of African, Chinese, and Hispanic ancestry, associations of n-3 PUFAs were similar with a representative SNP in FADS1 but less consistent with a representative SNP in ELOVL2. Our findings show that common variation in n-3 metabolic pathway genes and in GCKR influences plasma phospholipid levels of n-3 PUFAs in populations of European ancestry and, for FADS1, in other ancestries."
21823004,21823004,Effects of SNPs at newly identified lipids loci on blood lipid levels and risk of coronary heart disease in Chinese Han population: a case control study.,"Associations between ""lipid-related"" candidate genes, blood lipid concentrations and coronary artery disease (CHD) risk are not clear. We aimed to investigate the effect of three newly identified lipids loci from genome-wide association studies on CHD and blood lipid levels in Chinese Han population. The genotypes of SNPs at three newly identified lipid loci and blood lipids concentrations were examined in 1360 CHD patients and 1360 age- and sex-frequency matched controls from an unrelated Chinese Han population. Allele T of rs16996148 occurred less frequently in CHD patients with the odds ratio (OR) being 0.64 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.81), after adjusting for conventional risk factors and was associated with a 33% decreased CHD risk (P<0.01) comparing with the major allele G. Individuals with GT genotype had the lowest CHD risk. No associations were found between the polymorphisms of other two loci with CHD risk and all three SNPs had no effect on lipid profile in this population. SNP rs16996148 on chromosome 19p13 is significantly associated with lower risk for CHD in Chinese Han population. However, it remains unresolved why these lipid-related loci had significantly less effects than the correspondingly expected effects on blood lipids levels in this population."
21811992,21811992,[Association of single nucleotide polymorphism on chromosome 12q24.31 with susceptibility to coronary artery disease].,To determine whether the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on chromosome 12q24.31(rs2259816) is associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in Han population of southwest China.
21805344,21805344,Bovine GDF10 gene polymorphism analysis and its association with body measurement traits in Chinese indigenous cattle.,"The objective of this research was to detect bovine GDF10 gene polymorphism and analyze its association with body measurement traits (BMT) of animals sampled from 6 different Chinese indigenous cattle populations. The populations included Xuelong (Xl), Luxi (Lx), Qinchuan (Qc), Jiaxian red (Jx), Xianang (Xn) and Nanyang (Ny). Blood samples were taken from a total of 417 female animals stratified into age categories of 12-36 months. Polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) was employed to find out GDF10 single polymorphism nucleotide (SNPs) and explore their possible association with BMT. Sequence analysis of GDF10 gene revealed 3 SNPs in total: 1 in exon1 (G142A) and 2 in exon3 (A11471G, and T12495C). G142A and T12495C SNPs are both synonymous mutation. They showed 2 genotypes namely respectively (GG, GA) and (PP and PB). A11471G SNP is a missense mutation leading to the change of Alanine to Threonine amino acid. It showed three genotypes namely AA, BB and AB. Analysis of association of polymorphism with body measurement traits at the three locus showed that there were significant effects on BMT in Qc, Jx and Ny cattle population. These results suggest that the GDF10 gene might have potential effects on body measurement traits in the above mentioned cattle populations and could be used for marker-assisted selection."

Previous data suggested single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of rs1546124, rs4783099, and rs16974880 of the CRISPLD2 gene were associated with an increased risk of NSCLP; however, subsequent studies have yielded conflicting results. This study aims to evaluate the associations of the aforementioned polymorphisms with NSCLP in a Northwestern Chinese population."
21798758,21798758,IFN-γ+874 A/T polymorphism and cancer risk: an updated analysis based on 32 case-control studies.,"IFN-γ is a T-helper 1 cytokine and plays important roles in modulating almost all the immune responses, such as hematopoiesis, T-cell differentiation, antiproliferative, antiviral, and antitumor activities. A single nucleotide polymorphism (+874A/T) which is located in the first intron of the human IFN-γ gene can putatively influence the secretion of IFN-γ. Results from previous studies on the association of +874A/T polymorphism with different cancer types remained contradictory. In order to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed by searching PubMed, Embase, CNKI, and Chinese Biomedicine Database. Thirty two studies including 4524 cases and 5684 controls were collected for IFN-γ+874 A/T polymorphism. Summary odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for IFN-γ polymorphism and cancer were estimated using fixed- and random-effects models when appropriate. Overall, no evidence indicated that individuals carrying TT or AT genotypes had significantly increased cancer risk when compared with AA genotype carriers. However, stratified analysis by cancer types indicated a significantly increased risk of breast cancer (TT vs AA: OR=1.58, 95% CI=1.10-2.27, Pheterogeneity=0.26; TT vs"

21792231,21792231,Natural positive selection and north-south genetic diversity in East Asia.,"Recent reports have identified a north-south cline in genetic variation in East and South-East Asia, but these studies have not formally explored the basis of these clinical differences. Understanding the origins of these variations may provide valuable insights in tracking down the functional variants in genomic regions identified by genetic association studies. Here we investigate the genetic basis of these differences with genome-wide data from the HapMap, the Human Genome Diversity Project and the Singapore Genome Variation Project. We implemented four bioinformatic measures to discover genomic regions that are considerably differentiated either between two Han Chinese populations in the north and south of China, or across 22 populations in East and South-East Asia. These measures prioritized genomic stretches with: (i) regional differences in the allelic spectrum for SNPs common to the two Han Chinese populations; (ii) differential evidence of positive selection between the two populations as quantified by integrated haplotype score (iHS) and cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity (XP-EHH); (iii) significant correlation between allele frequencies and geographical latitudes of the 22 populations. We also explored the extent of linkage disequilibrium variations in these regions, which is important in combining genetic association studies from North and South Chinese. Two of the regions that emerged are found in HLA class I and II, suggesting that the HLA imputation panel from the HapMap may not be directly applicable to every Chinese sample. This has important implications to autoimmune studies that plan to impute the classical HLA alleles to fine map the SNP association signals."
21743172,21743172,The functional SNP rs4376531 in the ARHGEF gene is a risk factor for the atherothrombotic stroke in Han Chinese.,"The gene encoding RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor 10(ARHGEF10) has been reported to be a risk factor for atherothrombotic stroke (AS) in Japanese. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4376531 in intron 16 on ARHGEF10 is associated with AS and may play a role in the disease pathology. In order to explore the nature of this association in greater detail and in a new ethnic group, we carried out a case-control study to determine whether the rs4376531 polymorphism in ARHGEF10 is a risk factor of AS in Han Chinese people. This study was carried out to assay the frequency of genotypes and alleles of SNP rs4376531 in ARHGEF10 in patients with ischemic stroke and healthy controls using the polymerase chain reaction and the restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. A total of 383 individuals with AS in West China Hospital and 214 unrelated healthy controls were recruited. The frequencies of the G allele and GG genotype of the rs4376531 polymorphism were higher in the patients with AS than in control individuals: frequency of G, 91.0% vs 83.4%, P<0.001; GG, 82.2% vs 67.8%, P<0.001. After adjusting for sex, age, and multiple cardiovascular risk factors, the homozygous GG genotype for this variant was associated with a higher risk of AS, with an adjusted odds ratio of 4.99 (95% CI, 2.55-7.81, P< 0.001). Our findings suggest that the rs4376531 polymorphism in the ARHGEF10 gene is a risk factor for AS in the Han Chinese population."

21756274,21756274,Systematic confirmation study of reported prostate cancer risk-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in Chinese men.,"More than 30 prostate cancer (PCa) risk-associated loci have been identified in populations of European descent by genome-wide association studies. We hypothesized that a subset of these loci might be associated with PCa risk in Chinese men. To test this hypothesis, 33 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), one each from the 33 independent PCa risk-associated loci reported in populations of European descent, were investigated for their associations with PCa risk in a case-control study of Chinese men (1108 cases and 1525 controls). We found that 11 of the 33 SNP were significantly associated with PCa risk in Chinese men (P < 0.05). The reported risk alleles were associated with increased risk for PCa, with allelic odds ratios ranging from 1.12 to 1.44. The most significant locus was located on 8q24 region 2 (rs16901979, P = 5.14 × 10(-9)) with a genome-wide significance (P < (-8) ), and three loci reached the Bonferroni correction significance level (P < 1.52 × 10(-3)), including 8q24 region 1 (rs1447295, P = 7.04 × 10(-6)), 8q24 region 5 (rs10086908, P = 9.24 × 10(-4)) and 8p21 (rs1512268, P = 9.39 × 10(-4)). Our results suggest that a subset of the PCa risk-associated SNP discovered by genome-wide association studies among men of European descent is also associated with PCa risk in Chinese men. This finding provides evidence of ethnic differences and similarity in genetic susceptibility to PCa. Genome-wide association studies in Chinese men are needed to identify Chinese-specific PCa risk-associated SNP."

21723144,21723144,Genetic variation in BDNF is associated with allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis in an ethnic Chinese population in Singapore.,"Allergic diseases affect more than 25% of the world population and result from a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Recent evidence has shown that BDNF (Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor) could serve as an important marker of allergic disease. Increased levels of BDNF in blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and nasal lavage fluid positively correlate with disease activity and severity in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR), asthma and atopic eczema. However, reports on the association between genetic variation in BDNF and allergic disease have been controversial. This study therefore aims to clarify the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BDNF and a genetic predisposition to AR and asthma in an ethnic Chinese population of Singapore. Volunteers with a self-reported history of asthma (718 subjects) or a history of AR as determined by a researcher-administered questionnaire (795 subjects) were used in this study, alongside controls with no personal or family history of allergy (717 subjects). The association results identified a significant association for the tagSNP rs10767664 with a significant PDominant=0.0007 and OR=1.3 for AR and PDominant=0.0005 and OR=1.3 for asthma (using a dominant model of association). The haplotype based analysis also identified a significant association further confirming the single SNP association. The SNP rs10767664 is strongly linked (r2=0.95) to the functional polymorphism rs6265 (Val66Met), which has previously been reported to be associated to allergic phenotypes and also shown to affect BDNF expression. BDNF is a therefore a key molecular player in allergy. Further studies on polymorphisms within BDNF may shed light on its role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases and potentially serve as biomarkers for allergic disease."
21710448,21710448,A novel polymorphism of the GDF₁₀ gene and its association with body measurement traits in Chinese indigenous cattle.,"Body measurement traits are known to play numerous important roles in the assessment of productivity and economic value. They are influenced by several factors, among which genetic factors are predominant. The gene GDF₁₀ is involved in skeletal morphogenesis and is associated with body measurement traits. It may be an important candidate gene for marker-assisted selection. We used the PCR-SSCP technology to examine a possible association of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (G142A) of the bovine GDF₁₀ gene with body measurement traits in 417 animals belonging to six different Chinese cattle populations: Xue long (Xl), Luxi (Lx), Qinchuan (Qc), Jiaxian red (Jx), Xianang (Xn), and Nanyang (Ny). In the Jx population, least squares analysis revealed significant effects on hip width, chest depth and chest circumference. The animals with the GG genotype had higher mean values than those with the GA genotype for all three traits. We conclude that the SNP of the GDF₁₀ gene could be a very useful genetic marker for body traits in Jx cattle reproduction and breeding."

21733339,21733339,SNP and mRNA expression for glutathione peroxidase 4 in Kashin-Beck disease.,"Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) is a chronic endemic osteoarthropathy, which mainly occurs in West and Northeast China. Epidemiological studies suggest that Se deficiency is an important environmental factor for the incidence of KBD. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) belongs to the glutathione peroxidase family, which is crucial for optimal antioxidant defences. Our purpose is to investigate the putative association between GPx4 polymorphisms and the risk of KBD. Restriction fragment length polymorphism-PCR was used to detect two SNP (rs713041, rs4807542) in 219 cases and 194 controls in Han Chinese subjects, and quantitative analysis for the GPx4 mRNA level was performed by the real-time PCR method. The results revealed that linkage disequilibrium existed in the two SNP. A significant difference was observed in the haplotype A-T (P = 0·0066) of GPx4, which was obviously lower in the KBD cases (0·006 v. 0·032 %). Correlation analysis based on a single locus showed no association between each SNP and KBD risk. Furthermore, the GPx4 mRNA level was dramatically lower in the blood of KBD patients. Overall, our finding indicated GPx4 polymorphisms and decreased mRNA level may be related to the development of KBD in the Chinese population, suggesting GPx4 as a possible candidate susceptibility gene for KBD."
21695597,21695597,MHC region and risk of systemic lupus erythematosus in African American women.,"The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21 is a key contributor to the genetic basis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Although SLE affects African Americans disproportionately compared to European Americans, there has been no comprehensive analysis of the MHC region in relationship to SLE in African Americans. We conducted a screening of the MHC region for 1,536 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the deletion of the C4A gene in a SLE case-control study (380 cases, 765 age-matched controls) nested within the prospective Black Women's Health Study. We also genotyped 1,509 ancestral informative markers throughout the genome to estimate European ancestry to control for population stratification due to population admixture. The most strongly associated SNP with SLE was the rs9271366 (odds ratio, OR = 1.70, p = 5.6 × 10(-5)) near the HLA-DRB1 gene. Conditional haplotype analysis revealed three other SNPs, rs204890 (OR = 1.86, p = 1.2 × 10(-4)), rs2071349 (OR = 1.53, p = 1.0 × 10(-3)), and rs2844580 (OR = 1.43, p = 1.3 × 10(-3)), to be associated with SLE independent of the rs9271366 SNP. In univariate analysis, the OR for the C4A deletion was 1.38, p = 0.075, but after simultaneous adjustment for the other four SNPs the odds ratio was 1.01, p = 0.98. A genotype score combining the four newly identified SNPs showed an additive risk according to the number of high-risk alleles (OR = 1.67 per high-risk allele, p < 0.0001). Our strongest signal, the rs9271366 SNP, was also associated with higher risk of SLE in a previous Chinese genome-wide association study (GWAS). In addition, two SNPs found in a GWAS of European ancestry women were confirmed in our study, indicating that African Americans share some genetic risk factors for SLE with European and Chinese subjects. In summary, we found four independent signals in the MHC region associated with risk of SLE in African American women."
21674042,21674042,Association of ORAI1 haplotypes with the risk of HLA-B27 positive ankylosing spondylitis.,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammation of the sacroiliac joints, spine and peripheral joints. The aetiology of ankylosing spondylitis is still unclear. Previous studies have indicated that genetics factors such as human leukocyte antigen HLA-B27 associates to AS susceptibility. We carried out a case-control study to determine whether the genetic polymorphisms of ORAI1 gene, a major component of store-operated calcium channels that involved the regulation of immune system, is a susceptibility factor to AS in a Taiwanese population. We enrolled 361 AS patients fulfilled the modified New York criteria and 379 controls from community. Five tagging single nucleotides polymorphisms (tSNPs) at ORAI1 were selected from the data of Han Chinese population in HapMap project. Clinical statuses of AS were assessed by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Global Index (BAS-G). Our results indicated that subjects carrying the minor allele homozygote (CC) of the promoter SNP rs12313273 or TT homozygote of the SNP rs7135617 had an increased risk of HLA-B27 positive AS. The minor allele C of 3'UTR SNP rs712853 exerted a protective effect to HLA-B27 positive AS. Furthermore, the rs12313273/rs7135617 pairwise allele analysis found that C-G (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.27, 2.25; p = 0.0003) and T-T (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.36, 2.27; p<0.0001) haplotypes had a significantly association with the risk of HLA-B27-positive AS in comparison with the T-G carriers. This is the first study that indicate haplotypes of ORAI1 (rs12313273 and rs7135617) are associated with the risk of HLA-B27 positive AS."

21671168,21671168,Association of polymorphisms in angiotensin II receptor genes with aldosterone-producing adenoma.,"This study examined the association of polymorphisms in angiotensin II receptor genes (AT (1) R and AT (2) R) with the risk for aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) in a Chinese Han population. Four polymorphisms including rs5182 (573T/C) in exon 4, rs5186 (1166A/C) in 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) in AT (1) R gene and rs5194 (2274G/A) in 3'-UTR, rs1403543 (1675G/A) in intron 1 in AT (2) R gene were detected in 148 APA patients and 192 normal subjects (serving as control) by using a MGB-Taqman probe. The distribution of genotypes of each locus was in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) in the APA and control groups (P>0.05). The allele A frequency at rs5194 was significantly higher in the APA group (0.49) than in the control group (0.35) (χ (2)=12.08, P=0.001). Subjects with homozygotic genotype AA and heterozygotic genotype GA were at an increased risk for APA as compared to those with GG genotype (OR=2.66, 95% CI=1.45-4.87; OR=1.67, 95% CI=1.02-2.74). Furthermore, rs5194 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at AT (2) R gene was significantly associated with APA in additive (OR=1.64, 95% CI=1.21-2.20, P=0.001), dominant (OR=1.94, 95% CI=1.23-3.06, P=0.003), and recessive model (OR=2.01, 95% CI=1.17-3.45, P=0.01). It was concluded that rs5194 polymorphism at AT (2) R gene was associated with the risk for APA, which may constitute a genetic marker of APA."

Recently, the polymorphisms in MAMDC1 gene have been reported to associate with disease risk of SLE in European population. However, whether this association is replicated in Chinese population is unknown yet. A total of 491 SLE patients and 533 controls were recruited. Unlabeled probe-based high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) was used in genotyping. HRMA with unlabeled probe successfully distinguished all genotypes. SNP rs961616 was associated with rash [P = 0.015, odds ratio (OR) = 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.57-0.94] and photosensitivity (P = 0.001, OR = 0.63, 95%CI = 0.48-0.84), but not the disease risk (P = 0.133, OR = 0.88, 95%CI = 0.74-1.04), of SLE in Chinese population.

21674006,21674006,Genome-wide association study of schizophrenia in Japanese population.,"Schizophrenia is a devastating neuropsychiatric disorder with genetically complex traits. Genetic variants should explain a considerable portion of the risk for schizophrenia, and genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a potentially powerful tool for identifying the risk variants that underlie the disease. Here, we report the results of a three-stage analysis of three independent cohorts consisting of a total of 2,535 samples from Japanese and Chinese populations for searching schizophrenia susceptibility genes using a GWAS approach. Firstly, we examined 115,770 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 120 patient-parents trio samples from Japanese schizophrenia pedigrees. In stage II, we evaluated 1,632 SNPs (1,159 SNPs of p<0.01 and 473 SNPs of p<0.05 that located in previously reported linkage regions). The second sample consisted of 1,012 case-control samples of Japanese origin. The most significant p value was obtained for the SNP in the ELAVL2 [(embryonic lethal, abnormal vision, Drosophila)-like 2] gene located on 9p21.3 (p = 0.00087). In stage III, we scrutinized the ELAVL2 gene by genotyping gene-centric tagSNPs in the third sample set of 293 family samples (1,163 individuals) of Chinese descent and the SNP in the gene showed a nominal association with schizophrenia in Chinese population (p = 0.026). The current data in Asian population would be helpful for deciphering ethnic diversity of schizophrenia etiology."
21656575,21656575,Functional NBS1 polymorphism is associated with occurrence and advanced disease status of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,"As a component of the MRN (MRE11/RAD50/NBS1) complex, NBS1 plays an important role in cellular response to DNA damage and the maintenance of chromosomal integrity. The NBS1 E185Q polymorphism (8360G>C, rs1805794) has been frequently studied in some cancers with discordant results, but its association with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in Chinese population has not been investigated. Moreover, there is no report about the association between NBS1 3'UTR variant rs2735383 and the risk of NPC. A multiple center case-control analysis was performed to assess the association between NBS1 polymorphisms and NPC risk in Eastern and Southern Chinese population. The genotypes and haplotypes were determined in 1052 cases and 1168 controls and the associations with risk of NPC were estimated by logistic regression. Cell migration assays were performed in 24-well transwell chambers to detect the effects of NBS1 E185Q SNP on cell migration. We observed significant difference in genotype frequencies at the rs1805794 C/G site between cases and controls (P(trend) < 0.0001). The C allele increases the risk for invasive disease or metastatic disease, compared with G allele. More over, CNE-2 cells (NPC cell line) transfected with pcDNA-NBS1-185Q (8360CC) had significantly higher migration levels than those transfected with pcDNA-NBS1-185E (8360GG) (P = 0.024). These findings suggest that E185Q polymorphism in NBS1 may be a genetic modifier for the occurrence and aggression of NPC."
21668356,21668356,Association of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 gene polymorphisms with cervical cancer in Chinese women.,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Previous studies revealed that abnormal expression/activation of STAT family members were present in a large group of human malignant tumors. In the present study, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism, DNA sequencing, and Taqman probe real-time PCR techniques, we analyzed two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the STAT5B and STAT3 genes (rs6503691 and rs4769793, respectively) in 275 Chinese cervical cancer patients and 340 controls. Our results indicated that the genotype and allele frequencies of SNP rs4769793 were significantly different between the cervical cancer patients and normal subjects (p < 0.05, odds ratio = 1.35, 95% confidence interval = 1. 07-1.70). In addition, stratified analyses revealed that the polymorphism of rs4769793 was also associated with poor tumor differentiation and positive parametrial invasion (p < 0. 05). In contrast, SNP rs6503691 did not show any difference between patients and controls or association with patient clinical characteristics. Collectively, these findings suggested that STAT3 gene polymorphism (rs4769793) was associated with the susceptibility as well as poor differentiation and parametrial invasion of cervical cancer in Chinese women."
21665993,21665993,Association of variants in FRAP1 and PDGFRA with corneal curvature in Asian populations from Singapore.,"Corneal curvature (CC) is a key determinant of major eye diseases, such as keratoconus, myopia and corneal astigmatism. No prior studies have discovered the genes for CC. Here we report the findings from four genome-wide association studies of CC in 10 008 samples from three population groups in Singapore. Our discovery phase surveyed 2867 Chinese and 3072 Malays, allowing us to identify two loci that were associated with CC variation: FRAP1 on chromosome 1p36.2 and PDGFRA on chromosome 4q12. These findings were subsequently replicated in a validation study involving an additional 2953 Asian Indians and a further collection of 1116 Chinese children. The effect sizes of the identified variants were consistent across all four cohorts, with seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FRAP1 (lead SNP: rs17036350, meta P-value = 4.06 × 10(-13)) and six SNPs in PDGFRA (lead SNP: rs2114039, meta P-value = 1.33 × 10(-9)) attaining genome-wide significance in the SNP-based meta-analysis of the four studies. This is the first genome-wide survey of CC variation and we have identified two implicated loci in three genetically diverse Asian populations, suggesting the presence of common genetic etiology across multiple populations."
23949851,23949851,Association between single-nucleotide polymorphism in CISH gene and susceptibility to tuberculosis in Chinese Han population.,"The cytokine-inducible SRC homology 2 domain (CISH) gene is up-regulated by IL-2 in response to infection, and inhibits microbial infection. The objective of the present study was to examine whether genetic variants of CISH (SNPs) are associated with increased susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB) in individuals of Chinese Han ethnicity. We sequenced five previously identified SNPs of CISH in patients with TB or healthy controls. Three of the SNPs, rs148685070 [position -639; C/C], rs414171 [position -292; A/T], and rs6768300 [position -163; C/G]) are located in the promoter region, while the fourth (rs2239751 [position +1320; A/C]) near the translation start site, and the fifth (rs622502 [position +3415; C/G]) in the third intron. The AA genotypes of the SNPs rs2239751 and rs414171 were significantly associated with TB. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that subjects with the rs414171 AA genotype were more likely to have TB than those with the AT genotype. By contrast, we did not observe genetic variants of the rs148685070 SNP. In conclusion, two genetic variants in CISH gene appear to increase susceptibility to TB in Chinese Han population."

21656577,21656577,Association between fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 polymorphisms and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Human fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) polymorphisms have recently been shown to be associated with tumor progression of various types of cancer, including cancer of the breast, colon, and prostate and sarcoma. However, their association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unknown. We evaluated the association of FGFR4 polymorphisms with risk of HCC in a study population with HCC and with/without hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in East China. We genotyped four FGFR4 SNPs (rs351855, rs641101, rs376618, and rs31777) in 1,451 Chinese subjects, including 711 patients with HCC, 368 controls with HBV infection and 372 controls without HBV infection, using the TaqMan genotyping assay. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate associations of genotypes of each SNP with HCC risk. For the rs351855 (Arg388) locus, we observed a reduced HCC risk associated with the T variant genotypes, particularly for those whose tumors with gross portal vein tumor thrombosis (gross PVTT) (OR = 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI = 0.46-0.95 for CT + TT). Such a protective effect was also observed for those with liver cirrhosis (OR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.20-0.88 for CT + TT). Clearly the T allele was associated with these conditions. Our findings suggest that genetic polymorphism in FGFR4 may be a marker for risk of HCC with liver cirrhosis and gross PVTT in Chinese populations."

Obesity is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified several genes associated with obesity in Europeans. We wondered whether these genetic variants were associated with CAD. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs7561317 near TMEM18, rs7138803 near BCDIN3D/FAIM2 and rs12970134 near MC4R were examined in 930 Han Chinese subjects based on coronary angiography, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. There were no significant differences in genotypes and allele distributions of three SNPs between CAD and CAD-free groups. The AA genotype of SNP rs12970134 near MC4R was associated to obesity both in CAD group and CAD-free group in Han Chinese population (P < 0.001, OR = 2.96, 95% CI 2.01-3.73; and P = 0.003, OR = 2.59, 95% CI 1.86-3.19, respectively). Our observations suggest that the polymorphism rs12970134 near MC4R may be associated to the risk of obesity in Han Chinese population."
21638018,21638018,Identification of genes for bone mineral density variation by computational disease gene identification strategy.,"We previously used five freely available bioinformatics tools (Prioritizer, Geneseeker, PROSPECTR and SUSPECTS, Disease Gene Prediction, and Endeavour) to analyze the thirteen well-replicated osteoporosis susceptibility loci and identify a subset of most likely candidate osteoporosis susceptibility genes (Huang et al. in J Hum Genet 53:644-655, 2008). In the current study, we experimentally tested the association between bone mineral density (BMD) and the 9 most likely candidate genes [LAMC2(1q25-q31), MATN3(2p24-p23), ITGAV(2q31-q32), ACVR1(2q23-q24), TDGF1(3p21.31), EGF(4q25), IGF1(12q22-q23), ZIC2(13q32), BMP2(20p12)] which were pinpointed by 4 or more bioinformatics tools. Forty tag SNPs in nine candidate genes were genotyped in a southern Chinese female case-control cohort consisting of 1643 subjects. Single- and multi-marker association analyses were performed using logistic regression analysis implemented by PLINK. Potential transcription factor binding sites were predicted by MatInspector. The strongest association was observed between rs10178256 (MATN3) and trochanter (P < 0.001) and total hip BMD (P = 0.002). The SNP rs6214 (IGF1) showed consistent association with BMD at all the four measured skeletal sites (P = 0.005-0.044). Prediction of transcription factor binding suggested that the minor allele G of rs10178256 might abolish the binding of MESP1 and MESP2 which play vital roles in bone homeostasis, whereas the minor allele G of rs6214 might create an additional binding site for XBP1, a constitutive regulator of endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Our data suggested that variants in MATN3 and IGF1 were involved in BMD regulation in southern Chinese women."

Fluorescence Labeled Multiplex-PCR was used to genotype 12 short tandem repeats (STRs) within GLC3C region and transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) was used to analyze the association between PCG and these STR markers. Sixteen haplotype tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) were chosen from the location where the TDT tests showed positive results. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was used to perform SNP genotyping Haplotypes constructed from these SNPs were analyzed. The TDT results of STRs in the GLC3C area indicated that D14S279, D14S555 and D14S74 have significant transmission disequilibrium signals (p=0.0210, 0.0096 and 0.0034), with a genetic distance of 0.006 cM among them.

21625490,21625490,Genome-wide association study for atopy and allergic rhinitis in a Singapore Chinese population.,"Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an atopic disease which affects about 600 million people worldwide and results from a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. However genetic association studies on known candidate genes yielded variable results. The aim of this study is to identify the genetic variants that influence predisposition towards allergic rhinitis in an ethnic Chinese population in Singapore using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach. A total of 4461 ethnic Chinese volunteers were recruited in Singapore and classified according to their allergic disease status. The GWAS included a discovery stage comparing 515 atopic cases (including 456 AR cases) and 486 non-allergic non-rhinitis (NANR) controls. The top SNPs were then validated in a replication cohort consisting of a separate 2323 atopic cases (including 676 AR cases) and 511 NANR controls. Two SNPs showed consistent association in both discovery and replication phases; MRPL4 SNP rs8111930 on 19q13.2 (OR = 0.69, P(combined) = 4.46×10(-05)) and BCAP SNP rs505010 on chromosome 10q24.1 (OR = 0.64, P(combined) = 1.10×10(-04)). In addition, we also replicated multiple associations within known candidates regions such as HLA-DQ and NPSR1 locus in the discovery phase. Our study suggests that MRPL4 and BCAP, key components of the HIF-1α and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways respectively, are two novel candidate genes for atopy and allergic rhinitis. Further study on these molecules and their signaling pathways would help in understanding of the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis and identification of targets for new therapeutic intervention."
21604062,21604062,Association of rheumatoid arthritis risk with EGFR genetic polymorphisms in Taiwan's Han Chinese population.,"The involvement of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the pathogenesis of cancer is well documented. In contrast, its role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) development is not that well defined although previous studies suggested the possible link between autoimmune diseases and malignancy. Therefore, we aimed to examine whether there is a link between the EGFR genetic polymorphisms and the RA. Our study gauged the effects of EGFR (rs11543848 and rs17337023) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on RA among Taiwan's Han Chinese population. Polymorphism of EGFR gene was analyzed in 188 RA patients and 128 control subjects. Genotyping for EGFR SNPs was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay. Our data confirmed statistically significant increased risk of RA development in subjects with A carrier at rs17337023 SNP (P < 0.0001), and subjects with A allele at rs17337023 SNP (odds ratio [OR] = 1.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10-2.09). Furthermore, comparison of haplotype frequencies between patients and controls suggested GA and AT haplotypes were more ""at-risk"" for RA development (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.01, respectively). However, comparisons of the clinical features of RA patients according to different genotypes and haplotypes revealed no significant difference. In conclusion, our data yield the new information on EGFR polymorphisms (rs11543848 and rs17337023) with the susceptibility of RA development and polymorphism revealed by this study merit further investigation."

21598251,21598251,Genetic polymorphisms in AURKA and BRCA1 are associated with breast cancer susceptibility in a Chinese Han population.,"Centrosome defects can result in aneuploidy and genomic instability, and have important implications for breast cancer development. The Aurora-A and BRCA1 proteins interact and both are strongly involved in centrosome regulation. Genetic variants in these two genes may have an effect on breast cancer development. Here, we report a comprehensive single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and haplotype-tagging association study on these two genes in 1334 breast cancer cases and 1568 unaffected controls among the Chinese Han population. Apart from a missense SNP, rs2273535 (Phe31Ile), and a probable risk SNP, rs2064863, six htSNPs were analysed in three high-LD blocks of AURKA spanning from 10 kb upstream to 2 kb downstream of AURKA. For BRCA1, six htSNPs were analysed in a large high-LD region covering 98 kb (10 kb was extended to each end of BRCA1). The results showed that four SNPs in AURKA (data in recessive model, rs2273535: OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.03-4.66, p = 0.0422; rs2298016: OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.18-0.82, p = 0.0141; rs6024836: OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.18-2.00, p = 0.0014; rs10485805: OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.47-0.98, p = 0.0380) and one SNP in BRCA1 (rs3737559, dominant model OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.11-1.64, p = 0.0030) were associated with breast cancer susceptibility. After correction for multiple comparisons (FDR = 0.05), only rs6024836 and rs3737559 remained significant. Two haplotypes (CC of block 2, OR = 20.74, 95% CI = 4.35-98.88, p = 0.0001; GG of block 3, OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.12-1.56, p = 0.0010) and one diplotype (AG-GG of block 3, OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.18-2.26, p = 0.0031) within AURKA showed strong associations with breast cancer risk. One haplotype of BRCA1 (CTGTTG, OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.06-1.59, p = 0.0118) was also associated with breast cancer risk. However, women harbouring both at-risk genotypes of Aurora-A and BRCA1 were at a slightly increased risk compared with those harbouring either at-risk variant alone. Common genetic variants in the AURKA and BRCA1 genes may contribute to breast cancer development."
21599957,21599957,Association of the rs3743205 variant of DYX1C1 with dyslexia in Chinese children.,"Dyslexia is a learning disability that is characterized by difficulties in the acquisition of reading and spelling skills independent of intelligence, motivation or schooling. Studies of western populations have suggested that DYX1C1 is a candidate gene for dyslexia. In view of the different languages used in Caucasian and Chinese populations, it is therefore worthwhile to investigate whether there is an association of DYX1C1 in Chinese children with dyslexia."
21589658,21589658,Association of adiponectin SNP+45 and SNP+276 with type 2 diabetes in Han Chinese populations: a meta-analysis of 26 case-control studies.,"Recently, many studies have reported that the SNP+45(T>G) and SNP+276(G>T) polymorphisms in the adiponectin gene are associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in the Chinese Han population. However, the previous studies yielded many conflicting results. Thus, a meta-analysis of the association of the adiponectin gene with T2DM in the Chinese Han population is required. In the current study, we first determined the distribution of the adiponectin SNP+276 polymorphism in T2DM and nondiabetes (NDM) control groups. Our results suggested that the genotype and allele frequencies for SNP+276 did not differ significantly between the T2DM and NDM groups. Then, a meta-analysis of 23 case-control studies of SNP+45, with a total of 4161 T2DM patients and 3709 controls, and 11 case-control studies of SNP+276, with 2533 T2DM patients and 2212 controls, was performed. All subjects were Han Chinese. The fixed-effects model and random-effects model were applied for dichotomous outcomes to combine the results of the included studies. The results revealed a trend towards an increased risk of T2DM for the SNP+45G allele as compared with the SNP+45T allele (OR = 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11-1.62; P<0.01) in the Chinese Han population. However, there was no association between SNP+276 and T2DM (OR = 0.90; 95% CI, 0.73-1.10; P = 0.31). The results of our association study showed there was no association between the adiponectin SNP+276 polymorphism and T2DM in the Yunnan Han population. The meta-analysis results suggested that the SNP+45G allele might be a susceptibility allele for T2DM in the Chinese Han population. However, we did not observe an association between SNP+276 and T2DM."
21586232,21586232,[Polymorphism of ornithine decarboxylase antizyme inhibitor 1 gene is associated with liver cirrhosis in Chinese hepatitis B patients].,"A cirrhosis risk score (CRS) comprised of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in seven genes that predicts the risk of cirrhosis in Caucasian hepatitis C has been reported. The present study was to evaluate the association of 11 separate but related SNPs and the CRS with cirrhosis risk in Chinese hepatitis B patients. A total of 563 Chinese subjects with persistent HBV infection (349 with evident liver cirrhosis and 214 without cirrhosis clinically or pathologically) were studied. The candidate SNPs were detected with a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) method. The allele frequency and genotype distribution of each polymorphism as well as the CRS value within the cirrhosis and non-cirrhosis subjects were compared. The rs2679757 polymorphism of the antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1) gene was associated with the risk of cirrhosis (x2 = 6.79, P = 0.03, odds ratio for GG+AG versus AA = 1.63, 95% confidence interval = 1.13-2.35). A gene variant (rs886277) in the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M, member 5 gene (TRPM5) was associated with liver cirrhosis, but did not reach statistical significance (x2 = 5.77, P = 0.06). Two SNPs (rs4986791, rs62522600) are not polymorphic in Chinese. Genotype frequencies of other SNPs were not different between the cirrhosis and non-cirrhosis groups. The overall CRS values were not different between the cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic groups (median value 0.57 versus 0.62, Z = -1.05, P = 0.29). SNP rs2679757 in the AZIN1 gene is associated with the risk of HBV-related liver cirrhosis in Chinese. The CRS for Caucasian population has limited applicability for predicting liver cirrhosis in Chinese hepatitis B patients. SNPs associated with cirrhosis prognosis in hepatitis B patients and liver diseases with other etiologies warrant further clinical validation."
21574044,21574044,Identification of four SNPs and association analysis with meat quality traits in the porcine Pitx2c gene.,"The association of the porcine Pitx2c gene with meat quality traits was investigated in the present study. A total of eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found. Allele frequencies of four SNPs were further detected in four commercial breeds and eight Chinese indigenous breeds. Single SNP and meat quality associations were analyzed in a Yorkshire×Meishan F(2) population. The SNPs c.474C>T (P<0.01) and c.636C>T (P<0.05) showed a significant association with meat color (MCV1). The SNPs c.*37G>A and c.*47G>A were significantly associated with drip loss rate (DLR), water holding capacity (WHC) and meat color value (MCV1) consistently (P<0.05). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis revealed that the adjacent SNPs were in LD. Two major haplotypes were identified, and association analysis between haplotype combinations and meat quality indicated that the presence of two copies of haplotype 1 -CCGG- may improve meat quality."
21569632,21569632,Evidence for association between Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) gene polymorphisms and autism in Chinese Han population: a family-based association study.,"Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) gene is one of the most promising candidate genes for major mental disorders. In a previous study, a Finnish group demonstrated that DISC1 polymorphisms were associated with autism and Asperger syndrome. However, the results were not replicated in Korean population. To determine whether DISC1 is associated with autism in Chinese Han population, we performed a family-based association study between DISC1 polymorphisms and autism."
21565678,21565678,BHMT gene polymorphisms as risk factors for cleft lip and cleft palate in a Chinese population.,Convincing evidence suggests a link between increased risk of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) and low intake of folic acid by the mother during pregnancy. The present study was designed to explore if genetic variation in the betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) gene contributes to NSCL/P.
21575668,21575668,Association study of the CNS patterning genes and autism in Han Chinese in Taiwan.,"Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with high heritability. Despite different approaches worldwide to identify susceptibility loci or genes for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), no consistent result has been reported. CNS patterning genes have been recognized as candidate genes for autism based on neuroimage and neuropathology evidence. This study investigated four candidate genes (WNT2, EN2, SHANK3, and FOXP2) by a tag SNP approach in a family-based association study. The trio samples include 1164 subjects from 393 families, including 393 probands (aged 9.1±4.0years; male, 88.6%) diagnosed with autistic disorder (n=373) or Asperger's disorder (n=20) according to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria and confirmed by the Chinese ADI-R interview. Three tag SNPs of EN2 (7q36), 6 SNPs of WNT2 (7q31-33), 5 SNPs of SHANK3 (22q13.3), 3 SNPs of FOXP2 (7q31) were genotyped. TDT analysis was done to test the association of each tag SNP and haplotype. There was no association with autism for 17 tag SNPs of WNT2, EN2, SHANK3, and FOXP2 based on SNP analyses. Haplotype analyses did not reveal significant association except for the 6 tag SNPs of WNT2 gene showing a significant association on one haplotype composed of rs2896218 and rs6950765 (G-G) (p=0.0095). Other haplotypes composed of rs2896218 and rs6950765 (G-G) were also significantly associated with autism. The present study indicates that SHANK3 may not be a critical gene for the etiology of ASDs in Han Chinese population. Inconsistent findings in EN2 and FOXP2 in the Han Chinese population need further clarification. A haplotype of WNT2 (rs2896218-rs6950765: G-G) is significantly associated with ASDs in our trios samples, this finding warrants further validation by different sample and confirmation by functional study."
21565628,21565628,A functional variant in microRNA-196a2 is associated with susceptibility of colorectal cancer in a Chinese population.,"MicroRNAs (miRNA) can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Polymorphisms present in pri-, pre- and mature miRNAs can potentially modulate the expression of hundreds of genes, broadly affecting miRNA function. Notably, the rs11614913 SNP in miR-196a2 has been implicated in carcinogenesis, but its association with colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unexplored. We performed a case-control study to investigate the genetic association between this functional SNP and CRC susceptibility and progression."
21562710,21562710,Genotypes and phenotypes of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 in breast tumors among Chinese women.,"The relationship between IGF genotypes and phenotypes in breast tumors and their associations with breast cancer risk remain to be elucidated. Such information is especially scarce in Chinese women. To evaluate IGF-I and IGFBP-3 genotypes in relation to their phenotypes in local breast tissues and in association with breast cancer risk, we conducted a case-control study among Chinese women. The study recruited 403 breast cancer patients and 403 age-matched controls. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the IGF-I gene (rs1520220, rs2946834, rs2195239, and rs7965399) and two SNPs of the IGFBP-3 gene (rs2854746 and rs2960436) with known correlations with their phenotypes in the circulation were genotyped using TaqMan assays. Fresh tumor samples from the same patients were analyzed with immunoassays for protein concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3. Associations of breast cancer with these SNPs were examined using unconditional logistic regression. Correlations between IGF genotypes and phenotypes were determined with Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Of the six selected SNPs, only one IGF-I SNP (rs7965399) was associated with breast cancer risk in a recessive model (OR = 1.86; 95% CI: 1.04-3.32), and the association was more evident in patients who had menopause under age 50 or ER negative tumors. No associations were found between breast cancer and other three IGF-I and two IGFBP-3 SNPs. Patients with variant IGF-I or wild IGFBP-3 genotypes had higher peptide levels of IGF-I compared to those with wild IGF-I or variant IGFBP-3 genotypes. The selected IGF-I and IGFBP-3 SNPs did not show any strong evidence for being associated with breast cancer risk, but the genotypes were correlated with IGF-I phenotypes in tumor samples, suggesting possible influences of these SNPs on IGF-I activity in local tissues."
21565251,21565251,Genetic variants of the PITX3 gene are not associated with late-onset sporadic Parkinson's disease in a Chinese population.,"PITX3 is a transcription factor which determines the survival of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and is considered a candidate gene for Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent association studies indicated that three PITX3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs2281983, rs4919621, and rs3758549 are likely to be associated with PD. However, no similar associations in Chinese populations have been reported. To examine the nature of the association in Chinese individuals we analyzed DNA samples for these three PITX3 SNPs from 509 late-onset sporadic PD patients, and 494 healthy controls, using a ligase detection reaction (LDR). Results indicated that allele and genotype frequencies did not differ between patients and controls for all three SNPs, suggesting that these SNP sites do not contribute to the risk of developing PD in late-onset sporadic PD in this Chinese population."
21558165,21558165,Genetic association of polymorphism rs1333049 with gout.,"We suspect that genes or loci that contribute to coronary artery disease (CAD) may also play a role in the pathogenesis of gout, since hyperuricaemia leads to gout, and serum uric acid (SUA) levels are potential risk factors for CAD. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1333049 (C/G) on chromosome 9p21 has been implicated in previous studies to be associated with CAD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between this SNP and gout pathogenesis."
21557239,21557239,The grainyhead-like 2 gene (GRHL2) single nucleotide polymorphism is not associated with age-related hearing impairment in Han Chinese.,The grainyhead-like 2 gene (GRHL2) was found to be associated with age-related hearing impairment (ARHI) in Europeans. We tested whether the same association exists in the Han Chinese population.
21562341,21562341,Common variants in epithelial sodium channel genes contribute to salt sensitivity of blood pressure: The GenSalt study.,Rare mutations of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) lead to mendelian forms of salt-sensitive hypertension or salt-wasting hypotension. We aimed to examine the association between common variants in the ENaC genes and salt sensitivity of blood pressure (BP).
21556757,21556757,An intronic polymorphism rs2237062 in the CXCL14 gene influences HBV-related HCC progression in Chinese population.,"CXCL14 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 14) is a conserved member of chemokine family and functions as a chemoattractant for multiplicate immunocytes. CXCL14 expression is constitutive in normal tissues, but absent in wide range of epithelial tumors. Many reports have claimed its important role in tumorigenesis and vascularization. An association between rs2237062 polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) susceptibility was found in patients with chronic HCV infection in Japanese population. Here we analyzed, by using a polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR), the polymorphism in 202 non-HCC patients with HBV infection, 361 HBV-related HCC patients and 407 healthy controls. The aim was to detect the possible association of this single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with HBV-related HCC susceptibility and progression. However, no association was found between rs2237062 polymorphism and susceptibility to HBV infection or HBV-related HCC. Intriguingly, our stratification analysis revealed that HBV-related HCC patients in advanced phase (TNM-II-IV stage) had significantly higher C allele frequency at this polymorphism than patients at early stage (TNM-I stage) (33.5% vs. 25.7%), and its odds ratio reached 1.47 (95% CI 1.06-2.04, P = 0.021). These results suggest that the rs2237062 polymorphism in the CXCL14 gene might influence HBV-related HCC progression in Chinese population."

But no such rare variant in these two genes has as yet been adequately replicated in Chinese population and no common variant has been further investigated to be associated with ASDs."
21524676,21524676,Genetic study of two single nucleotide polymorphisms within corresponding microRNAs and susceptibility to tuberculosis in a Chinese Tibetan and Han population.,"MicroRNAs (miRNA) are thought to play important roles in the pathogenesis of diseases. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within miRNAs can change their characteristics via altering their target selection and/or expression, resulting in functional and/or phenotypic changes. We decided to investigate the genetic association with pulmonary tuberculosis with 2 nucleotide variations within corresponding microRNAs regulating the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediating signal pathway. MiRNAs potentially regulating the TLR-mediating signal pathway were predicted via bioinformatics. Finally, 2 SNPs, rs2910164 G>C and rs3746444 T>C within miR-146a and miR-499, were selected as candidates in accordance with some criteria. SNPs were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and validated by sequencing to demonstrate their association with susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in 337 PTB cases and 738 healthy controls, including 318 Tibetan and 757 Han individuals. Bioinformatics databases were searched to support the association between miRNAs and PTB. There was no association between rs3746444 and PTB risk (p = 0.118) in the Han population, but subjects carrying the C allele exhibited decreased PTB risk (odds ratio [OR] = 0.403 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.278-0.583]). However, there was an association between rs3746444 and PTB in the Tibetan population, and individuals carrying the C allele exhibited increased PTB risk (OR = 1.870 [95% CI 1.218-2.871]). A polymorphism (rs2910164 G>C) indicated an association with PTB risk in both Tibetan (p = 0.031) and Han (p = 0.000) populations. However, the role of the G allele of rs2910164, like the C allele in rs3746444, differed in the Tibetan (OR = 1.509, p < 0.05) and Han (OR = 0.575, p < 0.05) groups. This is the first report to suggest that a genetic association with pulmonary tuberculosis with SNPs within the corresponding miRNAs potentially regulates the TLR signal pathway. It is interesting that both the G allele (rs2910164) and the C allele (rs3746444) play different roles in 2 populations. Further functional analysis of the SNP and its impact on mRNA targets is required to confirm the relationship between genotype and phenotype."
21520258,21520258,Replication study of the association between adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and two estrogen receptor genes.,"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common disorder with a strong genetic predisposition. Associations between AIS and common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in estrogen receptor genes have been reported. rs9340799 in the gene for estrogen receptor α (ESR1) is reported to be associated with curve severity in Japanese and with AIS predisposition and curve severity in Chinese. In addition, rs1256120 in the gene for estrogen receptor β (ESR2) is reported to be associated with AIS predisposition and curve severity in Chinese. However, the sample sizes of these previous studies were small, and the associations of these SNPs have not been replicated. To examine the association between AIS and estrogen receptor genes, we investigated the association of rs9340799 and rs1256120 with AIS predisposition and curve severity using a large Japanese population, consisting of 798 AIS patients and 637 sex-matched controls. We found no association of either SNP with AIS predisposition or curve severity in the Japanese population. Considering the statistical power of the present study and the limitations of the previous reports, we conclude that the associations of rs9340799 and rs1256120 with AIS predisposition and curve severity are negative."

21541277,21541277,The association of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of the LAMA1 gene with susceptibility to Chinese high myopia.,High myopia is a severe hereditary ocular disease leading to blindness. LAMA1 (alpha subunit of laminin) is a promising candidate gene for high myopia present in the MYP2 (myopia 2) region. The purpose of this study was to determine if high myopia is associated with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants in LAMA1 in Chinese subjects.
21513752,21513752,Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in interleukin 12 (IL-12A and -B) with asthma in a Chinese population.,"Increasing evidence has indicated that genetic variants may contribute to immune dysregulation and susceptibility to noninfectious inflammatory diseases. Cytokines, including interleukin 12 (IL-12), play a key role in the regulation of the immune system. The aim of this study was to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in IL-12A and IL-12B were associated with asthma in a Chinese population. Genotype characteristics were determined in 197 asthma patients and 369 controls by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method and DNA sequencing assay. The genotype and allele frequencies of IL-12A rs568408 demonstrated significant differences between cases and controls (p < 0.001). The AC genotype of rs3212227 was associated with a significantly decreased risk of asthma compared with the AA genotype (p = 0.036). The subjects carrying combined genotypes (rs568408 AG and rs3212227 AC/CC) at both loci had a 2.05-fold increased asthma risk compared with those carrying all other genotypes (p = 0.001). In contrast, individuals carrying combined genotypes of rs568408 GG and rs3212227 AC/CC were associated with a significantly decreased risk of asthma compared with those carrying the combined genotypes of rs568408GG and rs3212227AA (p = 0.009). No significant difference was reported for rs2243115 between cases and controls. These results suggest that the SNPs in IL-12A rs568404 and IL-12B rs3212227 may individually and jointly contribute to the risk of asthma in a Chinese population."
21512825,21512825,Possible association between genetic variants in the H2AFX promoter region and risk of adult glioma in a Chinese Han population.,"H2AFX, a histone H2A gene family member X, is a key component in the detection of and response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) caused by ionizing radiation (IR), a known risk factor for glioma. Thus, genetic variants in the H2AFX promoter region that may result in abnormal protein expression could confer susceptibility to glioma. In this case-control study, we genotyped three common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs643788, rs8551, and rs2509851) in the H2AFX promoter region in 669 adult glioma patients and 638 cancer-free controls. The associations between each SNP or haplotype and glioma risk were estimated by calculating odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) using unconditional logistic regression models, with adjustment for age and sex. The H2AFX rs643788 A variant genotypes were significantly associated with reduced risk of glioma (GA versus GG: adjusted OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.56-0.94; GA/AA versus GG: adjusted OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.59-0.94), compared with the common GG genotype. Furthermore, this decreased risk was more evident among those aged ≥ 45 years (adjusted OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.45-0.90), male subjects (adjusted OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.50-0.96), and patients with glioblastoma (adjusted OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.46-0.94). These results suggest that a common variant in the H2AFX promoter region may modulate risk of glioma, particularly for adult glioma. However, our findings need to be replicated in other independent populations."
21528353,21528353,Genetic variants of 6q25 and breast cancer susceptibility: a two-stage fine mapping study in a Chinese population.,"A recent genome-wide association study identified a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2046210, in the 6q25 region as a breast cancer susceptibility locus in Chinese and subsequently replicated in a multicenter study. Further fine-mapping of this region may help identify the potential causative SNPs of breast cancer. We employed a block-based fine mapping analysis to investigate the tagging SNPs in a 41 kb block with the marker-SNP rs2046210 in the 6q25 region, and also extended our study by including two potentially functional SNPs (rs2234693 and rs1801132) within the ESR1 gene by a two-stage case-control study with 1,792 breast cancer cases and 1,867 controls (878 cases and 900 controls in the testing set and 914 cases and 967 controls in the validation set). Significant associations with breast cancer risk were observed for rs1038304, rs6929137, rs2046210, and rs10484919 in the 41 kb block of the 6q25 region in the testing set after controlling multiple testing. Together with the validation set samples, these four SNPs were all significantly associated with increased risk of breast cancer (additive OR from 1.25 to 1.34, additive P from 4.84 × 10(-6) to 7.17 × 10(-9)). After conditional regression and linkage disequilibrium analyses, rs6929137 and rs10484919 tend to be susceptible markers of breast cancer in this region and both of them were located at sites of histone modification according to the UCSC (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) genome database. Our results support that the 6q25 region is an important susceptibility region for breast cancer in Chinese women, and rs6929137 and rs10484919 are causative or marker SNPs for this region."

21510800,21510800,Association between promoter variants of interleukin-18 and schizophrenia in a Han Chinese population.,"An increasing amount of evidence suggests that interleukin-18 (IL-18) plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. However, association between single nucleotide polymorphism of IL-18 and the risk of schizophrenia has not been clarified. This study examined whether two promoter polymorphisms -137 G/C (rs187238) and -607 C/A (rs1946518) of IL-18 were associated with schizophrenia and six clinical symptoms (disorder of perception, thought disorder, disturbance of emotion, disorder of behavior and volition, suicide action, and aggressive action) to provide data for screening high-risk Han Chinese individuals. Three hundred seventy-two schizophrenic patients and 353 healthy controls from a Han Chinese population were examined to assess their genotype and allele frequencies of the two promoter polymorphisms of IL-18. The genotype distributions in both patients and controls were within Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. No significant differences were observed in the genotype or the allele frequencies of the two single-nucleotide polymorphisms between patients and controls. However, genotype frequencies of -607 C/A showed significant differences between patients and controls in the appearance of perception disorder (χ2 = 6.153, p = 0.046). A significant difference was detected in -137 G/C between patients and controls in the appearance of aggressive action (χ2 = 3.909, p = 0.048). In conclusion, IL-18 gene promoter polymorphisms may not contribute to the susceptibility of schizophrenia in a Han Chinese population, but two single-nucleotide polymorphisms, -137 G/C and -607 C/A, may play a role in the development of perception disorder and aggressive action, respectively."
21509048,21509048,Deletion of the late cornified envelope genes LCE3C and LCE3B is associated with psoriasis in a Chinese population.,"A common deletion comprising LCE3B and LCE3C, members of the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene cluster, has been shown to be significantly associated with psoriasis in several Caucasian populations. The expression of LCE can be induced by skin barrier disruption, leading to psoriatic lesions. To identify whether deletion of genes in the LCE region is a genetic risk factor in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, we genotyped the LCE3C and LCE3B deletion and single-nucleotide polymorphism rs4112788, which is in strong linkage disequilibrium with the LCE gene cluster, via direct sequencing in 468 psoriasis patients and 768 controls in a Chinese population. We found that deletion of the two LCE genes was associated with psoriasis (odds ratio=1.917; 95% confidence interval=1.291-2.847, P=0.001), a conclusion that was similar to that of another independent Chinese cohort study. The deletion was not significantly associated with the age of disease onset, and there was no significant epistatic interaction between deletion and PSORS1 risk allele on 6p21.3. Our study confirms an association between the deletion of LCE3C and LCE3B and psoriasis in a Chinese population."

21461645,21461645,Association of mtDNA D-loop polymorphisms with risk of gastric cancer in Chinese population.,"The aim of present study was to evaluate the association of common polymorphisms detected in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop region (mononucleotide repetitive D310, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) D16521) with susceptibility to gastric cancer (GC) in northwestern Chinese population. A total of 180 GC patients and 218 healthy controls were investigated by using PCR- denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) assay. Genotype and allele distributions and haplotype construction were analyzed in case-control study. We found D310 and D16521 heteroplasmy were significantly different between GC cases and controls (p < 0.05), and D16521 homoplasmy showed association with histological grade of GC (p < 0.05). Haplotype 7C/T, 8C/C and 9C/C had significant association with GC risk implied from analysis of D310 and D16521. Taken together, these findings suggested that mtDNA D-Loop polymorphisms and haplotypes may contribute to genetic susceptibility to GC in Chinese population."

21492465,21492465,Single nucleotide polymorphisms at the TRAF1/C5 locus are associated with rheumatoid arthritis in a Han Chinese population.,Genetic variants in TRAF1C5 and PTPN22 genes have been shown to be significantly associated with arthritis rheumatoid in Caucasian populations. This study investigated the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TRAF1/C5 and PTPN22 genes and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a Han Chinese population. We genotyped SNPs rs3761847 and rs7021206 at the TRAF1/C5 locus and rs2476601 SNP in the PTPN22 gene in a Han Chinese cohort composed of 576 patients with RA and 689 controls. The concentrations of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (CCP) and rheumatoid factor (RF) were determined for all affected patients. The difference between the cases and the controls was compared using χ2 analysis.
21435309,21435309,Association of bovine CD4 and STAT5b single nucleotide polymorphisms with somatic cell scores and milk production traits in Chinese Holsteins.,"CD4+ T cells play a key role in the immune response of pathogen-induced mastitis in dairy cattle. Mammary gland factor STAT5b is involved in the regulation of CD4+T cell differentiation during inflammatory response and milk production. Little is known about the genetic variation effects of bovine CD4 and STAT5b genes on somatic cell score (SCS) and milk production traits in dairy cattle. The aim of the study was to investigate the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of bovine CD4 and STAT5b in Chinese Holsteins and to analyse their association with estimated breeding values (EBVs) for SCS and milk production traits. In the present study, SNPs of CD4 (NC_007303 g.13598C>T) and STAT5b (NC_007317 g.31562 T>C) were identified and genotyped in Chinese Holstein population. The results showed that both SNPs were significantly associated with the EBVs for milk yield and protein yield in Chinese Holstein cows, and the SNP in CD4 was associated with the EBV for SCS (P<0.01). The additive effect of CD4 SNP on protein yield was significant (P<0.05), and the dominant effect of STAT5b SNP was significant on milk yield and protein yield (P<0.01). Cows with combination genotype C7 (CCTT: CD4 g.13598C>T and STAT5b g.31562 T>C) had the highest SCS EBV but lower milk yield, while cows with C2 (TTTC) produced more milk, fat and protein than the other eight combination genotypes. These results suggested that the SNPs in CD4 and STAT5b may be potential genetic markers for SCS and milk/protein yields selecting and warrant further functional research."

21402531,21402531,[Association study between TNFSF4 and coronary heart disease].,"Previous studies suggest that TNFSF4 is a susceptibility gene of atherosclerosis. But case-control association analysis in Swedish population and German population provided inconsistent, even opposite results. In order to explore the relationship between this gene and coronary heart disease (CHD) in Chinese Han population, we collected 498 cases and 509 controls from Qilu hospital of Shandong University and analyzed the association between five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1234314, rs45454293, rs3850641, rs1234313, and rs3861950) of TNFSF4 and CHD. On the basis of using traditional statistical analysis methods based on single SNP and haplotypes, we introduced principal component score-based logistic regression analysis to deal with the data. The results suggested that in Armitage trend test, only rs3861950 was significant, when used the Bonferroni correction, and all of the five SNPs were not statistically significant. In the logistic regression analysis which adjusts the confounding factors, all of the five SNPs were not statistically significant. In haplotype analysis, the frequencies of six haplotypes were significantly different in cases and controls (CTAGT (P=0.0006), CTAAC (P=0.0123), CCAGT (P=0.0004), GTGGT (P=0.0329), GCGAC (P<0.0001), and GCAAC (P=0.0173)). In principal component score-based logistic regression analysis, the first principal component has statistical significance (P=0.0236). These results indicate that TNFSF4 is a susceptibility gene of CHD in Chinese Han population."
21414668,21414668,Association of the functional polymorphism in the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene with schizophrenia in the three ethnic groups of the Malaysian population.,"The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is a candidate gene for schizophrenia as its encoded enzyme is involved in the metabolic inactivation of dopamine and noradrenaline. Several molecular genetic studies thus far have demonstrated that the COMT functional polymorphism of Val158Met is susceptible with schizophrenia. Hence, the present study aims to determine this genetic association of this SNP in the three major ethnic groups of the Malaysian population. A total of 317 patients (79 Malays, 154 Chinese and 84 Indians) meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and 417 healthy subjects (160 Malays, 164 Chinese and 93 Indians) were recruited. A PCR-RFLP method was used to determine the genotypes and alleles present. We found a significant association of genotypes within the total pooled samples, as well as in the female subgroup, with a higher frequency of heterozygotes in schizophrenia subjects. However, there were no significant differences in allele and genotype frequency between the schizophrenic patients and normal controls in all three ethnic groups. Our current findings suggest that the Val158Met polymorphism has a weak association with schizophrenia in the Malaysian population and does not play a major role in conferring susceptibility to the schizophrenia in any of the three major local ethnicities."
21415033,21415033,Association of the calcyon neuron-specific vesicular protein gene (CALY) with adolescent smoking initiation in China and California.,"Although previous investigations have indicated a role for genetic factors in smoking initiation, the underlying genetic mechanisms are still unknown. In 2,339 adolescents from a Chinese Han population in the Wuhan Smoking Prevention Trial (Wuhan, China, 1998-1999), the authors explored the association of 57 genes in the dopamine pathway with smoking initiation. Using a conservative approach for declaring significance, positive findings were further examined in an independent sample of 603 Caucasian adolescents followed for up to 10 years as part of the Children's Health Study (Southern California, 1993-2009). The authors identified 1 single nucleotide polymorphism (rs2298122) in the calcyon neuron-specific vesicular protein gene (CALY) that was positively associated with smoking initiation in females (odds ratio = 2.21, 95% confidence interval: 1.49, 3.27; P = 8.4 × 10(-5)) in the Wuhan Smoking Prevention Trial cohort, and they replicated the association in females from the Children's Health Study cohort (hazard rate ratio = 2.05, 95% confidence interval: 1.27, 3.31; P = 0.003). These results suggest that the CALY gene may influence smoking initiation in adolescents, although the potential roles of underlying psychological characteristics that may be components of the smoking-initiation phenotype, such as impulsivity or novelty-seeking, remain to be explored."
21385855,21385855,A 3-bp deletion in the HBS1L-MYB intergenic region on chromosome 6q23 is associated with HbF expression.,"Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is regulated as a multigenic trait. By genome-wide association study, we confirmed that HBS1L-MYB intergenic polymorphisms (HMIP) and BCL11A polymorphisms are highly associated with HbF in Chinese β-thalassemia heterozygotes. In this population, the variance in HbF resulting from the HMIP is 13.5%; that resulting from the BCL11A polymorphism is 6.4%. To identify the functional variant in HMIP, we used 1000 Genomes Project data, single nucleotide polymorphism imputation, comparisons of association results across populations, potential transcription factor binding sites, and analysis of phylogenetic conservation. Based on these studies, a hitherto unreported association between HbF expression and a 3-bp deletion, between 135 460 326 and 135 460 328 bp on chromosome 6q23 was found. This 3-bp deletion is in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs9399137, which is the single nucleotide polymorphism in HMIP most significantly associated with HbF among Chinese, Europeans, and Africans. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed erythropoiesis-related transcription factors binding to this region in K562 cells. Based on transient expression of a luciferase reporter plasmid, the DNA fragment encompassing the 3-bp deletion polymorphism has enhancer-like activity that is further augmented by the introduction of the 3-bp deletion. This 3-bp deletion polymorphism is probably the most significant functional motif accounting for HMIP modulation of HbF in all 3 populations."
21402474,21402474,GWAS-identified colorectal cancer susceptibility locus associates with disease prognosis.,"Extensive evidence has suggested that risk factors of cancer development may also modulate cancer clinical outcome.

Given the pivotal importance of these variants in CRC, we sought to evaluate their associations with clinical outcomes of the disease."
21382839,21382839,Relation of FGFR2 genetic polymorphisms to the association between oral contraceptive use and the risk of breast cancer in Chinese women.,"The fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene (FGFR2) has been associated with the risk of breast cancer in multiple ethnic populations, and its effect has been suggested to be hormone-dependent. A large, 2-stage, population-based case-control study was conducted in urban Shanghai, China, during the periods of 1996-1998 and 2002-2005. Exposure and genotyping information from 2,073 patients with breast cancer and 2,084 age-matched population controls was available for evaluation of the interactions between FGFR2 polymorphisms and exogenous estrogen exposure in the development of breast cancer. A logistic regression model was used to compute adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Of 20 genotyped and 25 imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 22 were significantly associated with breast cancer. Three genotyped SNPs in close linkage disequilibrium, rs2303568, rs3135730, and rs1078806, and an imputed SNP of rs755793 in complete linkage disequilibrium with other 8 SNPs were observed to interact significantly with oral contraceptive (OC) use. The SNP-cancer association was evident only among OC users, and the OC use was only associated with the risk of breast cancer among carriers of these minor alleles at these loci. These findings suggest that genetic variants in FGFR2 may modify the role of OC use in causing breast cancer in Chinese women."

21396113,21396113,TLR7 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the 3' untranslated region and intron 2 independently contribute to systemic lupus erythematosus in Japanese women: a case-control association study.,"The Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) gene, encoded on human chromosome Xp22.3, is crucial for type I interferon production. A recent multicenter study in East Asian populations, comprising Chinese, Korean and Japanese participants, identified an association of a TLR7 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), rs3853839, with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), especially in males, although some difference was observed among the tested populations. To test whether additional polymorphisms contribute to SLE in Japanese, we systematically analyzed the association of TLR7 with SLE in a Japanese female population."
21378986,21378986,Genome-wide association identifies a susceptibility locus for coronary artery disease in the Chinese Han population.,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) causes more than 700,000 deaths each year in China. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in populations of European ancestry identified several genetic loci for CAD, but no such study has yet been reported in the Chinese population. Here we report a three-stage GWAS in the Chinese Han population. We identified a new association between rs6903956 in a putative gene denoted as C6orf105 on chromosome 6p24.1 and CAD (P = 5.00 × 10⁻³, stage 2 validation; P = 3.00 × 10⁻³, P = 1.19 × 10⁻⁸ and P = 4.00 × 10⁻³ in three independent stage 3 replication populations; P = 4.87 × 10⁻¹², odds ratio = 1.51 in the combined population). The minor risk allele A of rs6903956 is associated with decreased C6orf105 mRNA expression. We report the first GWAS for CAD in the Chinese Han population and identify a SNP, rs6903956, in C6orf105 associated with susceptibility to CAD in this population."
21362260,21362260,[Molecular polymorphism of gypa gene in association with MN human blood group in Chinese Han population].,"This study was purposed to investigate the molecular polymorphism of gypa gene in association with MN human blood group in Chinese Han population. The MN phenotypes of 202 random samples from unrelated Chinese Han volunteers were identified by serology techniques. The primer for gypa gene exon 2 were designed and synthesized according to reference sequences of NG-007470 gene from GenBank, the DNA of 202 samples was amplified by PCR, at the same time, the amplified products were analyzed by direct DNA sequencing. The results showed that all samples had 2 base substitutions at 1st and 56th nt of gypa exon 2, among them the MN phenotype heterozygote exited mainly in the form of 1A > C, 22T/C, 34A/G, 35T/G, 56T > C; the MM phenotype homozygote exited mainly in the form of 1A > C, 22C, 34G, 35T, 56T > C; the NN phenotype homozygote exited mainly in the form of 1A > C, 22T, 34A, 35G, 56T > C. It is concluded that the polymorphism of gypa gene in associated with MN blood group in Chinese Han population is decided by 5 nucleotide sites of 1, 22, 34, 35 and 56. The bases of 1 and 56 are non-functional gypa single nucleotide polymorphism."
21358043,21358043,PICALM and CR1 variants are not associated with sporadic Alzheimer's disease in Chinese patients.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of senile dementia, and the overall prevalence increases exponentially with age. It is well known that genetic variants may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Recently, two independent large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified 3 novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs11136000 within CLU, rs3851179 within PICALM and rs6656401 within CR1) that are associated with late-onset AD (LOAD), and these results have been replicated by other studies performed in the Caucasian population. Recently, an independent study failed to verify the association for the SNP within CLU in a Han Chinese population, indicating that there may be genetic heterogeneity in this association. In the present study, we studied the SNPs within PICALM and CR1 in 474 sporadic AD patients (SAD) and 591 unrelated age- and sex-matched healthy controls of Han Chinese descent. Our data revealed that the frequencies of both of these SNPs were not significantly difference between the SAD and control groups. Thus, the association between SNPs within PICALM, CR1, and SAD should be studied further in different ethnic groups."
21371780,21371780,Association of prepro-orexin polymorphism with obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome.,"Because of the potential role of orexin neuronal circuitry in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness and arousal and breathing, it seems reasonable to speculate that abnormalities in the prepro-orexin gene could be relevant to studies of obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS); and it might be a candidate gene in the pathogenesis of OSAHS."
21346769,21346769,CYP7A1 genotypes and haplotypes associated with hypertension in an obese Han Chinese population.,"This study investigated the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs3808607 and rs1125226) within the CYP7A1 promoter and hypertension susceptibility in a Han Chinese population. From 2003 through 2006, a population-based case-control study was performed in a cohort of 1187 randomly selected Han Chinese subjects. A sib-pair study for a transmission disequilibrium test analysis was carried out in 76 hypertensive (HT) families (n=312) from northeastern Liaoning province. SNPs were detected using real-time PCR. No significant differences were found in the genotype or allele frequencies of either SNP (P>0.05), with no excessive allele sharing. For rs3808607, the frequency of the AA genotype in obese hypertensive patients was 31.91%, significantly higher than in normotensive (NT) subjects (12.73%; odds ratio (OR)=3.21, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.35-7.66). For rs3808607, the AA genotype frequency was significantly higher in obese male HT subjects (27.87%) than in matched NTs (7.41%; OR=4.83, 95% CI=1.03-22.65). After adjustment for environmental risk factors in obese participants, the AA genotype was associated with hypertension (OR=3.395, 95% CI=1.412-8.162). Among subjects with body mass index 28 kg m(-2), the HT and NT groups had significantly different frequencies of Hap I (C/C) and Hap IV (A/A). The frequencies of rs3808607 alleles in the CYP7A1 gene differed significantly between obese HT and NT men. Haplotypes I and IV were associated with hypertension in obese participants."
21344643,21344643,Association of catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) gene -287A/G polymorphism with susceptibility to obsessive-compulsive disorder in Chinese Han population.,"Several studies suggested a genetic component in the etiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). COMT involves in the degradation of dopamine and norepinephrin. As another functional SNP locus, COMT -287A/G polymorphism showed an effect on enzyme activity, suggesting that it may influence brain dopamine levels. To identify association of COMT -287A/G polymorphism with susceptibility to OCD in Chinese Han population. We evaluate the genetic contribution of the COMT -287A/G polymorphism in 200 OCD patients and 403 OCD-free control of Chinese Han population by PCR-RFLP. In addition, we investigate whether COMT -287A/G polymorphism is associated with one or more of these symptom dimensions or other characteristics such as sex, age of onset, and tic-relatedness and evaluate the association of the factorial structure of OCD symptoms from the Y-BOCS checklist with the COMT -287A/G polymorphism. A statistical difference was found in the genotypic frequencies of COMT -287A/G between the OCD and control groups (χ(2)  = 13.99, DF = 2, P = 0.00091) and in the genotypic frequencies of GG genotype versus AA and AG genotypes of COMT -287 (χ(2)  = 13.49, DF = 1, P = 0.00024, OR = 3.43, 95% CI = 1.78-6.62). There was a trend for an association in the genotypic distributions of COMT -287A/G polymorphism of males (χ(2)  = 27.81; DF = 2; P < 0.001) and females (χ(2)  = 7.31; DF = 2; P = 0.026) between the OCD patients and the controls. Using principal component analysis, we derived 5 factors from 12 main contents of OCD symptoms from the Y-BOCS checklist and found no association with COMT -287A/G polymorphism. Our study supports the involvement of the COMT -287A/G polymorphism in the genetic susceptibility to OCD in Chinese Han population."
22977497,22977497,Lack of evidence to support the association of polymorphisms within the TNFSF4 gene and coronary heart disease in a Chinese Han population.,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a complex disorder resulting from the interaction of a number of genetic and environmental factors. Increasing evidence has shown that OX40 ligand (OX40L), also known as tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 4 (TNFSF4), plays a key role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. However, there have been inconsistent reports in various populations, and further studies are required to clarify this issue. A gene-based association study was conducted using five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported in previous studies. The five SNPs (rs1234314, rs45454293, rs3850641, rs1234313 and rs3861950) were genotyped in 547 unrelated CHD patients and 601 healthy controls in a case-control study using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. rs1234314, rs3850641 and rs3861950 were further genotyped in an additional 512 cases and 520 controls using the TaqMan SNP genotyping method. A possible relationship between the five SNPs and the severity of CHD was investigated. The results revealed no significant association between the TNFSF4 polymorphism and CHD. In addition, the stratified analysis of genotypic and allelic frequencies showed no association between the TNFSF4 polymorphism and CHD in either gender. Finally, no significant correlation between the TNFSF4 polymorphism and CHD severity was detected. These findings do not support a role of the TNFSF4 gene in CHD pathogenesis in the Chinese Han population."

21326860,21326860,Identification of novel susceptibility Loci for kawasaki disease in a Han chinese population by a genome-wide association study.,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis syndrome that primarily affects infants and young children. Its etiology is unknown; however, epidemiological findings suggest that genetic predisposition underlies disease susceptibility. Taiwan has the third-highest incidence of KD in the world, after Japan and Korea. To investigate novel mechanisms that might predispose individuals to KD, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 250 KD patients and 446 controls in a Han Chinese population residing in Taiwan, and further validated our findings in an independent Han Chinese cohort of 208 cases and 366 controls. The most strongly associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected in the joint analysis corresponded to three novel loci. Among these KD-associated SNPs three were close to the COPB2 (coatomer protein complex beta-2 subunit) gene: rs1873668 (p = 9.52×10⁻⁵), rs4243399 (p = 9.93×10⁻⁵), and rs16849083 (p = 9.93×10⁻⁵). We also identified a SNP in the intronic region of the ERAP1 (endoplasmic reticulum amino peptidase 1) gene (rs149481, p(best) = 4.61×10⁻⁵). Six SNPs (rs17113284, rs8005468, rs10129255, rs2007467, rs10150241, and rs12590667) clustered in an area containing immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions genes, with p(best)-values between 2.08×10⁻⁵ and 8.93×10⁻⁶, were also identified. This is the first KD GWAS performed in a Han Chinese population. The novel KD candidates we identified have been implicated in T cell receptor signaling, regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, as well as antibody-mediated immune responses. These findings may lead to a better understanding of the underlying molecular pathogenesis of KD."

Single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis was performed by amplifying intron 1 of KLF6 and sequencing the products. The KLF6 genotype IVS1 -27AA was significantly less frequent in gastric cancer patients than in controls and significantly less frequent in patients with advanced (stage III/IV) gastric cancer than in those with early (stage I/II) cancer. Stratification by location, Lauren's classification and histological differentiation revealed no significant differences in genotype distribution. Thus, in this Chinese population the KLF6 IVS1 -27AA genotype was associated with a decreased risk of gastric cancer and with cancer stage. Further study is required to clarify the mechanisms involved and, potentially, to facilitate the design of effective clinical trials."
21318467,21318467,Glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) gene rs4425043 polymorphism is associated with overweight and obesity in Chinese women.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of GCKR polymorphism on the prevalence of overweight and obesity in Chinese female subjects using a gene-wide tagging- single nucleotide polymorphism (tSNP) strategy. We conducted a genetic association study in the Taizhou Retiree Women Cohort, a sub-cohort of the Taizhou longitudinal study. We genotyped four tSNPs (rs4425043, rs780094, rs814295, and rs8179206) of the GCKR gene using the Taqman assay in 2,851 female subjects and investigated their associations with overweight and obesity. Odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived from ordered logistic regression model. We observed significant association between rs4425043 and body-mass-index-defined overweight and obesity. The frequencies of A allele of the rs4425043 exhibited a significant increasing trend from normal weight (13.20%), overweight (15.08%), to obese subjects (17.10%) (P = 0.006). Individuals with the GA or AA genotypes showed a 31% excessive risk to develop overweight or obesity (95% CI: 1.12-1.52, P = 0.001). In addition, we observed significantly increased levels of fasting plasma glucose associated with variations of both rs780094 and rs814295 (5.03, 5.09, and 5.15 mmol/L for rs780094 AA, GA and GG genotypes, respectively, and 5.03, 5.11, and 5.20 mmol/L for rs814295 AA, GA and GG genotypes, respectively). In conclusion, a novel polymorphism (rs4425043) in the GCKR gene increases the risk of overweight and obesity in Chinese women. Previous report that other polymorphisms in the GCKR gene are associated with glucose levels have also been confirmed."
21304559,21304559,Common variants near TERC are associated with leukocyte telomere length in the Chinese Han population.,"A recent genome-wide association study has identified an association between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and a locus at 3q26 that includes TERC. In order to evaluate the effects of the SNPs rs12696304 and rs16847897 near TERC in the population of mainland China, we conducted an association study of LTL focusing on these two candidate SNPs in a sample of 4016 Chinese Han individuals. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association of LTL with each SNP adjusted for age, gender and diabetes status. In the study, we confirmed the association of SNP rs12696304 and rs16847897 near TERC with LTL in the Chinese Han population (P ∼ 4.5 × 10(-3) and 9.5 × 10(-5), respectively). Each copy of the major allele of rs12696304 and rs16847897 was associated with a shorter mean telomere length of 0.024 and 0.031 T/S respectively, which is equivalent to about 3 and 4 years of average age-related telomere attrition. Our short report confirmed the effects of SNPs near TERC on LTL in the Chinese Han population for the first time."
21399483,21399483,NEDD9 gene polymorphism influences the risk of Alzheimer disease and cognitive function in Chinese older persons.,"Neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated (NEDD9) gene was a new candidate risk gene for Alzheimer disease (AD). The CC genotype of a single nucleotide polymorphism rs760678 within this gene was associated with increasing risk of AD in a large study with white population. Our study aimed to replicate the initial report in Chinese population and explore its effect on cognitive performance. A total of 262 patients with AD, 293 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 434 cognitive intact controls were recruited in the study. The result showed that G allele had a greater risk of AD (χ for trend test=5.61, df 1, P=0.018). The effects were mainly observed among Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 noncarriers (χ for trend test=4.30, df 1, P=0.038). After adjustment of sex, age, education year, and APOE ε4 status by logistic regression, significant association between NEDD9 GG genotype and AD remained [OR=2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.02-4.08, P=0.044]. The scores of Cantonese version of the Mini-mental State Examination and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Subscale-Cognitive subscale were associated with N polymorphism after adjusting for sex, age, education year, and ApoE ε4 status (Linear regression model, P<0.05). Our study identified rs760678 within NEDD9 gene in association with the risk of AD and cognitive performance in Chinese older persons. The fact that different alleles accounted for the risk in different population might suggest that there were ethnic group specific haplotypes that were primarily responsible for the predisposition."
21312063,21312063,Study of the association between growth differentiation factor 15 gene polymorphism and coronary artery disease in a Chinese population.,"Growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 belongs to a member of the transforming growth factor-β cytokine superfamily, and elevated GDF-15 concentrations are linked to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and future adverse cardiac events in apparently healthy elderly women, acute coronary syndrome, and chronic heart failure. However, its genetic mechanisms are still unknown. We investigated whether GDF-15 -3148C>G variant (SNP, rs4808793) is associated with a predisposition to coronary artery disease (CAD) and its severity in a Chinese population. We studied 418 consecutive patients, including 192 with coronary stenosis ≥50% or previous myocardial infarction and 226 controls without documented CAD. Coronary artery disease cases and controls were genotyped for SNP rs4808793 by using the ligase detection reaction method. The three genotypes CC, CG, and GG were present in rs4808793. No differences were found in genotype distribution and allele frequencies of rs4808793 between subjects with and without CAD, or when grouped according to sex. Logistic regression did not reveal any increased risk of CAD in subjects carrying the CG, GG genotype, or G allele at rs4808793 compared with individuals carrying the CC genotype or C allele; this finding was the same when subjects were grouped by sex (all P > 0.05). Rs4808793 does not affect main anthropometric and metabolic characteristics, nor did there exists any association between rs4808793 and the severity of coronary lesions (all P > 0.05). Our data do not support an association of rs4808793 with CAD or its severity in a Chinese population."

21298663,21298663,A SNaPshot assay for genotyping 44 individual identification single nucleotide polymorphisms.,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which have relatively low mutation rates and can be genotyped after PCR with shorter amplicons compared with short tandem repeats (STRs), are being considered as potentially useful markers in forensic DNA analysis. Those SNPs with high heterozygosity and low Fst (F-statistics) in human populations are described as individual identification SNPs, which perform the same function as STRs used in forensic routine work. In the present study, we developed a multiplex typing method for analyzing 44 selected individual identification SNPs simultaneously by using multiplex PCR reaction in association with fluorescent labeled single base extension (SBE) technique. PCR primers were designed and the lengths of the amplicons ranged from 69 to 125 bp. The population genetics data of 79 unrelated Chinese individuals for the 44 SNP loci were investigated and a series of experiments were performed to validate the characteristic of the SNP multiplex typing assay, such as sensitivity, species specificity and the performance in paternity testing and analysis of highly degraded samples. The results showed that the 44-SNPs multiplex typing assay could be applied in forensic routine work and provide supplementary data when STRs analysis was partial or failed."
21298365,21298365,CXCL12 G801A polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of benign salivary gland tumors in the Chinese population.,"The chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 have been found to be important in tumor progression. A single-nucleotide polymorphism of CXCL12 G801A has been described and investigated in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection and in the susceptibility to several cancers. Here, we investigated the association between the CXCL12 G801A polymorphism and susceptibility to benign and malignant salivary gland tumors (SGTs) by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in 102 Chinese SGT patients and 101 healthy controls. The frequencies of the AG (P = 0.001; odds ratio (OR), 3.764) and AA (P = 0.004; OR, 6.852) genotypes of CXCL12 were significantly higher in patients with benign SGTs than in the healthy controls. The frequency of the A allele of CXCL12 was also significantly higher in benign SGTs (P = 0.00; OR, 1.395) compared with the healthy controls. However, the AG (P = 0.171; OR, 3.163) and AA (P = 0.854; OR, 0.667) genotypes did not increase the risk of malignant SGTs significantly. The frequency of the CXCL12 A allele was also not found to be higher in malignant SGTs (P = 0.267; OR, 1.917) compared with the controls. Taken together, our results suggested that the CXCL12 G801A polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of benign SGTs, but not malignant SGTs, in the Chinese population."

21286723,21286723,The CD226 gene in susceptibility of rheumatoid arthritis in the Chinese Han population.,"Recent case-control studies have identified some loci that are associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Among these, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), Gly307Ser (rs763361), in the CD226 gene was first discovered to confer the risk of RA in populations with European and Colombian ancestry. Because the effect of genetic factors varies in different races, the association between RA and CD226 is yet to be evaluated in other non-European populations. Here, we report the significant association between CD226 and RA in a Chinese population of 423 randomly enrolled individuals. The statistical results show that the rs763361 SNP in the CD226 gene is significantly associated with RA in the Chinese population group (P (obs) = 0.005, odds ratio = 1.52). After adjusting for sex and age using multivariate logistics regression analysis, the association is still positive (P (adj) = 0.029, odds ratio = 1.45). Meta-analysis confirms the association between rs763361 and RA (overall P < 0.001, overall odds ratio = 1.12). The test of odds ratio heterogeneity also suggests that the rs763361 SNP confers the same risk of RA in both the Chinese and the Colombian populations, and indicates that rs763361 may play a more important role in non-European populations compared with the European population (P = 0.031). These results demonstrate a genetic association between the CD226 gene and RA in a Chinese Han population with a potentially greater genetic effect than in the European population."

In a pooled analysis of more than 31,000 women of East-Asian, European, and African ancestry, we found a positive association for rs2046210 and breast cancer risk in Chinese women [ORs (95% CI) = 1.30 (1.22-1.38) and 1.64 (1.50-1.80) for the AG and AA genotypes, respectively, P for trend = 1.54 × 10⁻³⁰], Japanese women [ORs (95% CI) = 1.31 (1.13-1.52) and 1.37 (1.06-1.76), P for trend = 2.51 × 10⁻⁴], and European-ancestry American women [ORs (95% CI) = 1.07 (0.99-1.16) and 1.18 (1.04-1.34), P for trend = 0.0069]. No association with this SNP, however, was observed in African American women [ORs (95% CI) = 0.81 (0.63-1.06) and 0.85 (0.65-1.11) for the AG and AA genotypes, respectively, P for trend = 0.4027]. In vitro functional genomic studies identified a putative functional variant, rs6913578. This SNP is 1,440 bp downstream of rs2046210 and is in high linkage disequilibrium with rs2046210 in Chinese (r(2) = 0.91) and European-ancestry (r² = 0.83) populations, but not in Africans (r² = 0.57). SNP rs6913578 was found to be associated with breast cancer risk in Chinese and European-ancestry American women. After adjusting for rs2046210, the association of rs6913578 with breast cancer risk in African Americans approached borderline significance. Results from this large consortium study confirmed the association of rs2046210 with breast cancer risk among women of Chinese, Japanese, and European ancestry. This association may be explained in part by a putatively functional variant (rs6913578) identified in the region."

21258797,21258797,A single-nucleotide polymorphism of the STAT4 gene is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in female Chinese population.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease with complex genetic inheritance. Genetic association of signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) with SLE susceptibility has been convincingly established in multiple populations including Asians, whereas studies of genetic relations between STAT4 polymorphisms and subphenotypes of SLE were rarely conducted. In this study, we selected Chinese female population and investigated genetic association between a polymorphism of STAT4 gene (rs7582694) and SLE. Furthermore, genetic association tests based on different subsets classified by 11 clinical manifestations were also performed. A total of 675 SLE female patients and 678 healthy controls were enrolled into this study, and SNP genotyping was performed using Sequenom's MassArray system (Sequenom iPLEX assay). Our study showed strong evidence for genetic predisposition of rs7582694 to SLE (X ( 2 ) = 23.7, OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.58-0.79, P = 1.13 × 10(-6)), while no association was observed between rs7582694 and any clinical presentations. The results of our study demonstrated that STAT4 rs7582694 SNP was significantly associated with SLE, and these results were in accordance with previous studies."
21274863,21274863,Strong influence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DP gene variants on development of persistent chronic hepatitis B virus carriers in the Han Chinese population.,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health issue, especially in Asia. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) implicated genetic variants in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DP locus associated with chronic hepatitis B in Japanese and Thai populations. To confirm whether the polymorphisms at the HLA-DP genes are associated with persistent chronic HBV infection in Han Chinese, we conducted an independent case-control study using 521 persistent chronic HBV carriers and 819 controls that included 571 persons with HBV natural clearance and 248 never HBV-infected (healthy) individuals. Eleven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a region including HLA-DPA and HLA-DPB and an adjacent SNP in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a neighboring HLA-DR13 locus were genotyped using the TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. Eleven variants at HLA-DP showed a strong association with persistent chronic HBV carrier status (P = 1.82 × 10(-12) to 0.01). We also stratified the analysis by HBV clearance status to test the association between these polymorphisms and HBV natural clearance; similar results were obtained (P = 2.70 × 10(-11) to 0.003). Included SNPs define highly structured haplotypes that were also strongly associated with HBV chronic infection (block 1: odds ratio [OR] = 0.54, P = 8.73 × 10(-7) ; block 2: OR = 1.98, P = 1.37 × 10(-10) ). These results further confirm that genetic variants in the HLA-DP locus are strongly associated with persistent HBV infection in the Han Chinese population."
21272446,21272446,"Association of a single nucleotide polymorphism at 6q25.1,rs2046210, with endometrial cancer risk among Chinese women.","A recent genome-wide association study identified a new susceptibility locus for breast cancer, rs2046210, which is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located upstream of the estrogen receptor α(ESR1) gene on chromosome 6q25.1. Given that endometrial cancer shares many risk factors with breast cancer and both are related to estrogen exposure and that rs2046210 is in close proximity to the ESR1 gene, we evaluated the association of SNP rs2046210 with endometrial cancer risk among 953 cases and 947 controls in a population-based, case-control study conducted in Shanghai, China. Logistic regression models were used to derive odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) after adjusting for potential confounders. We found that the A allele of rs2046210, linked to an increased risk of breast cancer, was associated with increased but not statistically significant risk of endometrial cancer (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.96-1.41 for the GA and AA genotypes compared with the GG genotype); the association was stronger among post-menopausal women (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.00-1.65). The association tended to be stronger among women with higher or longer estrogen exposure than among women with relatively lower or shorter exposure to estrogen. Our study suggests that rs2046210 may play a role in the etiology of endometrial cancer. Additional studies are needed to confirm our findings."
21243490,21243490,Different genetic effect of PXK on systemic lupus erythematosus in the Korean population.,"PXK was identified as a novel candidate gene for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Caucasians. But a recent replication study in Hong Kong Chinese reported that PXK was not associated with SLE. The aim of this study was to determine whether PXK is associated with SLE in Koreans. We genotyped single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6445975 of PXK using the TaqMan assay in 527 Korean patients with SLE and 517 healthy Korean control subjects. Genotypic associations were assessed using multiple logistic regression models. Additional analyses were also performed by subphenotype stratification. No association was detected between PXK rs6445975 and SLE (odds ratio (OR) = 1.06, P = 0.57). PXK rs6445975 showed positive associations with photosensitivity (P = 0.02) and the production of anti-Sm Ab (P = 0.04) among SLE patients. Thus, the association of PXK rs6445975 with SLE that was previously observed in Caucasians was not replicated in Koreans or in Hong Kong Chinese. It is possible that PXK has different genetic contribution on SLE between Caucasians and Asians and that the gene is associated with disease subphenotypes rather than with overall susceptibility."

Some of them are also differentially distributed in various ethnic populations, suggesting selective functionality. We have therefore sequenced all exons and flanking regions of p53 from the Singaporean Chinese population and report here the characterization of some novel and uncharacterized SNPs - four in intron 1 (nucleotide positions 8759/10361/10506/11130), three in intron 3 (11968/11969/11974) and two in the 3'UTR (19168/19514). Allelic frequencies were determined for all these and some known SNPs, and were compared in a limited scale to leukemia and lung cancer patient samples. Intron 2 (11827) and 7 (14181/14201) SNPs were found to have a high minor allele frequency of between 26-47%, in contrast to the lower frequencies found in the US population, but similar in trend to the codon 72 polymorphism (SNP12139) that shows a distribution pattern correlative with latitude. Several of the SNPs were linked, such as those in introns 1, 3 and 7. Most interestingly, we noticed the co-segregation of the intron 2 and the codon 72 SNPs, the latter which has been shown to be expressed in an allele-specific manner, suggesting possible regulatory cross-talk. Association analysis indicated that the T/G alleles in both the co-segregating intron 7 SNPs and a 4tagSNP haplotype was strongly associated increased susceptibility to lung cancer in non-smoker females [OR: 1.97 (1.32, 3.394)]. These data together demonstrate high SNP diversity in p53 gene between different populations, highlighting ethnicity-based differences, and their association with cancer risk."

We conducted the first case-control study in a Han Chinese population to explore the associations between these three SNPs and colorectal, gastric, and lung cancers. Of the three SNPs, only rs12953717 was strongly associated with the three types of cancer, fitting the overdominant model. Compared with the CC/TT (CC combined with TT) genotype, the adjusted odds ratios for the CT genotype were 2.002 (95% CI, 1.250-3.207, P = 0.004), 1.678 (95% CI, 1.048-2.689, P = 0.031), 3.825 (95% CI, 2.310-6.335, P < 1 × 10(-4)), and 2.294 (95% CI, 1.537-3.343, P < 1 × 10(-4)), respectively, for colorectal, gastric, lung, and combined cancers.

21221677,21221677,Contribution of the sclerostin domain-containing protein 1 (SOSTDC1) gene to normal variation of peak bone mineral density in Chinese women and men.,"A genome-wide linkage analysis in Chinese families revealed a significant quantitative trait loci on chromosome 7p21.1 for femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) (LOD = 3.68), and a potential candidate gene, sclerostin domain-containing protein 1 (SOSTDC1), is located in this region. SOSTDC1 belongs to a class of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonists that bind BMPs and regulate their signaling. We therefore genotyped 6 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tag-SNPs) in SOSTDC1 gene using allele-specific PCR method and investigated the association between SOSTDC1 gene polymorphisms and peak BMD variation in 401 Chinese female-offspring nuclear families (including 1260 subjects) and 400 Chinese male-offspring nuclear families (including 1215 subjects), respectively. Using both family-based (quantitative transmission disequilibrium test) and population-based (ANOVA) methods of analyses, BMD values were adjusted for age, height and weight. In female-offspring nuclear families, we found a significant within family association between rs16878759 and the lumbar spine peak BMD (P = 0.003) and rs16878759 accounted for 1.4% of the lumbar spine peak BMD variation. Moreover, haplotype CCC (containing rs12699800, rs16878759, and rs17619769) had a significant within family association with the lumbar spine peak BMD (P = 0.001) and accounted for 1.9% of the peak BMD variation at this bone site. However, in the male-offspring nuclear families, we failed to detect any significant association between any SNP or haplotype and peak BMD at any bone site. In conclusion, our results indicate for the first time that the genetic polymorphisms in SOSTDC1 have an effect on attainment and maintenance of peak bone mass in Chinese women."

In this study, the authors evaluated the effect of these loci on breast cancer and its disease characteristics in women from northeast of China, Heilongjiang Province. Seven SNPs were successfully genotyped in 492 breast cancer patients and 510 healthy controls using the SNaPshot method. The associations between SNPs and breast cancer were examined by logistic regression. The associations between SNPs and disease characteristics were examined by the chi-square test or one-way ANOVA as needed. The authors confirmed the effects of the allele A for rs2046210 at 6q25 on increased breast cancer risk in the population, with odds ratio 1.417 (P = 2×10⁻⁴). However, no significant association was detected between SNPs from TNCR9, LSP1, MAP3K1, 2q35, and 8q24 and breast cancer. Analyses of the disease characteristics showed that SNP rs2046210 was associated with age at menopause (P = 0.001). MAP3K1 SNP rs889312 and LSP1 SNP rs3817198 were associated with HER2 status in the patient cohort (P = 0.036 and P = 0.005, respectively). And SNP rs3817198 was also associated with the combined status of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 (P = 0.012). SNP rs13281615 was associated with age at menarche (P = 0.023), and SNP rs3803662 was associated with average duration of breastfeeding (P = 0.036). All other disease characteristics, including tumor grade, clinical stage, and the status of estrogen receptor or P53, were not significantly associated with any of these variants. These results suggested that the rs2046210 was associated with breast cancer in a Northern Chinese population, and some SNPs were also associated with breast cancer characteristics."
21219635,21219635,Variants in the Toll-interacting protein gene are associated with susceptibility to sepsis in the Chinese Han population.,Deregulated or excessive host immune responses contribute to the pathogenesis of sepsis. Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways and their negative regulators play a pivotal role in the modulation of host immune responses and the development of sepsis. The objective of this study was to investigate the association of variants in the TLR signaling pathway genes and their negative regulator genes with susceptibility to sepsis in the Chinese Han population.

21193990,21193990,A PTPN22 promoter polymorphism -1123G>C is associated with RA pathogenesis in Chinese.,"The minor allele of the non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) +1858C>T within the PTPN22 gene has now been unequivocally confirmed as conferring susceptibility to RA in population from Europe and America, but not in population from Asia. The aim of this study was to jointly address and integrate these separate findings to further elucidate the association between the PTPN22 gene and RA in Chinese Hans of Guangdong province. Four hundred and ninety-four cases with RA and 496 healthy controls were randomly selected, their SNPs at position -1123G>C (rs2488457), +1858C>T (rs2476601), +788G>A (rs33996649), and rs1310182 were genotyped using PCR-RFLP, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. +1858C>T (rs2476601) and +788G>A (rs33996649) are not polymorphic in Chinese Hans. Meanwhile, our result reveals that the degree of association between the promoter polymorphism, -1123G>C and RA, was analogous to that observed in Japanese reports (odds ratio [OR] = 1.517, 95% CI = [1.154-1.995], P = 0.003). Expression study also indicated a tendency for association between -1123G>C and PTPN22 gene expression. Our study underpins that the promoter polymorphism, -1123G/C, may be a causal SNP for RA in Asian."

21237270,21237270,Polymorphisms in STAT4 increase the risk of acute renal allograft rejection in the Chinese population.,"Recently, the signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) gene have been associated with multiple autoimmune diseases. Taking into consideration that the different autoimmune diseases may share some common pathogenetic pathways, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of STAT4 rs7574865 polymorphism on acute allograft rejection. The present case-control study included 453 renal allograft recipients and 378 sex matched healthy controls. Genotyping was performed using a PCR based discrimination assay for the rs7574865 STAT4 SNP. No evidence of association was found between health controls and renal transplant recipients for the G/T or T/T genotype and wild type G/G. (p=0.431, two-tailed χ(2); OR=0.894, 95% CI=0.677-1.181). But among the transplant recipients, the G/T or T/T genotype was more common in transplant rejectors (acute allograft rejection) than nonrejectors who had mostly wild-type G/G genotype (p=0.003, two-tailed χ(2); OR=0.542, 95% CI=0.361-0.815). We also found a trend that the frequency of G/T or T/T genotype was also relatively more in the acute cellular mediated rejection than antibody mediated ones (p=0.049, two-tailed χ(2); OR=0.466, 95% CI=0.216-1.003). Thus, our data suggest that the rs7574865 STAT4 SNP is a genetic susceptibility variant for acute renal allograft rejection in the Chinese population."
22393992,22393992,HLA class II variants in Chinese breast cancer patients.,"Alterations of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules are relevant to the development of breast cancer and metastatic progression. However, the role of HLA class II polymorphisms in the pathogenesis and progression of breast cancer is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the association between HLA class II variants and breast cancer susceptibility and prognosis in a Chinese population. Sixteen variants in HLA class II were detected with the Sequenom MassArray® iPLEX System in 216 breast cancer patients and 216 healthy controls. An association analysis based on unconditional logistic regression was carried out to determine the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each SNP. Stratified analysis by oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status was also performed. Among 16 variants, only seven conformed to Hardy-Weinberg proportions in the controls. None of these seven variants showed statistically significant differences between the case and control groups in this Han Chinese population. However, chr6_32737733, a variant in HLA-DQB1, showed significant associations with both ER-negative and PR-negative breast cancer in the best fit to the dominant model. Furthermore, another significant correlation was seen between chr6_32606112, a variant in HLA-DRB5, and PR positivity. These results indicate that although no breast cancer risk variants in HLA class II were found in this Chinese population, HLA-DQB1 chr6_32737733 may be involved in determining a poor prognosis, whereas HLA-DRB5 chr6_32606112 may relate to a good prognosis."
21181275,21181275,Association study of single nucleotide polymorphisms in pre-miRNA and rheumatoid arthritis in a Han Chinese population.,"The aim of this study was to perform an association study between two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2910164 G>C and rs3746444 T>C in pre-miRNA (hsa-mir-146a and hsa-mir-499) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the Han Chinese population. 208 Han Chinese patients with RA and 240 healthy controls were recruited in this study. The SNPs was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and rheumatoid factor (RF) was measured by rate nephelometry. The genotype frequencies between cases and controls were compared by χ(2) analysis. No significant association between the SNPs (rs2910164 and rs3746444) and RA was observed (P = 0.631 and 0.775, respectively), and the SNPs did not show any association with the RF-positive (P = 0.631 and 0.775, respectively). However, there was a significant difference on the level of anti-CCP antibody between different genotypes in rs3746444 (P = 0.007). The heterozygote CT had significantly higher level of anti-CCP antibody compared with homozygote CC and TT (P = 0.054 and 0.003, respectively). We first investigated the association between the SNPs (rs2910164 G>C and rs3746444 T>C) in the pre-miRNA (hsa-mir-146a and hsa-mir-499) and RA in a Han Chinese population. We did not find a significant association between the SNPs and the susceptibility to RA, while the SNP rs3746444 may affect anti-CCP antibody production."
21185157,21185157,Association between HTR2C polymorphisms and metabolic syndrome in patients with schizophrenia treated with atypical antipsychotics.,Previous research indicates that common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor gene (HTR2C) are associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS) related to antipsychotic treatment.

21153769,21153769,A tagging SNP in ALOX5AP and risk of stroke: a haplotype-based analysis among eastern Chinese Han population.,"A genome-wide approach found significant association of two at-risk haplotypes (HapA, HapB) in the ALOX5AP gene with myocardial infarction and stroke. To date, it is still controversial whether ALOX5AP gene polymorphisms are risk factors for stroke. The aim of the present study is to investigate the association between the ALOX5AP gene polymorphism and the risk for stroke in Eastern Chinese Han population with a haplotype-based analysis. We conducted a comprehensive association study of 507 stroke patients and 510 healthy controls to assess the association between the ALOX5AP tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) and stroke risk. Genotyping was performed using the PCR-RFLP assay. In the single-locus analysis, we found that the rs9579646 AG genotype was associated with a marginally decreased risk for stroke (adjusted odds ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.96), compared with the AA genotype. Haplotype-based association analysis of block 2 involving rs10507391 and rs12429692 revealed that the decreased risk of stroke was significantly associated with haplotype AA (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.46-0.95). These results suggested that the genetic variants in ALOX5AP might modulate the risk of stroke in Eastern Chinese Han population. The frequencies of single-marker alleles and haplotypes showed remarkable differences from those in other populations."

21113018,21113018,Ala499Val (C>T) and Lys939Gln (A>C) polymorphisms of the XPC gene: their correlation with the risk of primary gallbladder adenocarcinoma--a case-control study in China.,"Genetic variations in the gene XPC may be associated with increased risk for gallbladder cancer (GBC). In this study, we detected two non-synonymous polymorphisms in XPC (Ala499Val and Lys939Gln) in 334 cases of GBC and 329 subjects of hospital-based age- and sex frequency-matched controls in China using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Allelic association analysis for the two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed that the risk allele T of Ala499Val was significantly associated with GBC [odds ratio (OR)=1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11-1.76, P=0.005), with a population attributive risk of 5.3%. Logistic regression analysis revealed that Ala499Val CT heterozygote (OR=1.56, 95% CI: 1.13-2.14, P=0.002) and TT homozygote (OR=1.93, 95% CI: 1.04-3.55, P=0.048) had a significantly increased risk compared with CC homozygotes. Genetic analysis suggested that either the SNPs directly exert an effect or the linked functional gene impact of the disease trait likely follows an additive or dominant model. Gene interaction analysis demonstrated that the effects of XPC diplotypes (defined as the number of risk genotypes at the two SNP loci) were highly dependent on gallstone. The data from this case-control study indicated that XPC exonic variants contributed to the risk of GBC in this Chinese population."
21145615,21145615,Potentially functional polymorphisms in cell cycle genes and the survival of non-small cell lung cancer in a Chinese population.,"The cell cycle governs the proliferation and growth of cells and is strictly controlled by some regulators including cyclins, CDKs and CKIs. Germ-line and somatic mutations in cell cycle genes were frequently observed in a subset of cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, we hypothesized that potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cell cycle genes may contribute to the prognosis of NSCLC in China. 54 potentially functional polymorphisms in key cell cycle genes (CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, CDK7, CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CCNE1, CCNA1, CCNA2, CCNB1, CCNH, p15, p16, p18, p19, p21, p27, Cdc25A and Cdc25B) were genotyped by using Illumina SNP genotyping platform to evaluate their associations with survival of NSCLC in a clinical cohort of 568 patients. We found that p18 rs3176447 variant genotypes were significantly associated with the decreased risk of death of NSCLC patients (adjusted HR=0.74, 95% CI=0.57-0.97 in an additive model; adjusted HR=0.76, 95% CI=0.55-0.97 in a dominant model); however, p21 rs2395655 variant genotypes were significantly associated with the increased risk of death (adjusted HR=1.21, 95% CI=1.02-1.42 in an additive model; adjusted HR=1.38, 95% CI=1.07-1.78 in a recessive model). Furthermore, the combined effect of unfavorable genotypes for these two SNPs was more prominent in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, late stage and without chemo- or radio-therapy. Although the exact biological function remains to be explored, our findings suggest possible association of polymorphisms of p18 and p21 with the prognosis of NSCLC in a Chinese population. Further large and functional studies are needed to confirm our findings."
21107608,21107608,Significant association of SNP rs2106261 in the ZFHX3 gene with atrial fibrillation in a Chinese Han GeneID population.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac rhythm disorder at the clinical setting and accounts for up to 15% of all strokes. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs2106261 and rs7193343 in ZFHX3 (zinc finger homeobox 3 gene) and rs13376333 in KCNN3 (encoding a potassium intermediate/small conductance calcium-activated channel, subfamily N, member 3) that showed significant association with AF in multiple populations of European ancestry. Here, we studied a Chinese Han, GeneID cohort consisting of 650 AF patients and 1,447 non-AF controls to test whether the GWAS findings on ZFHX3/KCNN3 and AF can be expanded to a different ethnic population. No significant association was detected for rs7193343 in ZFHX3 and rs13376333 in KCNN3. However, significant association was identified between rs2106261 in ZFHX3 and AF in the GeneID population for both allelic frequencies (P=0.001 after adjusting for covariates of age, gender, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus; OR=1.32), and genotypic frequencies assuming either an additive or recessive model (OR=1.29, P=0.001 and OR=1.77, P =0.00018, respectively). When only lone AF cases were analyzed, the association remained significant (OR=1.50, P=0.001 for allelic association; OR=1.45, P=0.001 for an additive model; OR=2.24, P=0.000043 for a recessive model). Our results indicate that rs2106261 in ZFHX3 confers a significant risk of AF in a Chinese Han population. The study expands the association between ZFHX3 and AF to a non-European ancestry population and provides the first evidence of a cross-race susceptibility of the 16q22 AF locus."

21062626,21062626,Interleukin-17A gene variants and risk of coronary artery disease: a large angiography-based study.,"Recent studies have also revealed that interleukin (IL)-17A plays a key role in atherosclerosis and its complication, but the relationship of its common variants with coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been extensively studied. We systematically screened sequence variations in the IL17A gene and designed an angiography-based case-controlled study consisting of 1031 CAD patients and 935 control subjects to investigate the association between the selected polymorphisms of IL-17A gene and CAD risk in Chinese Han population. Frequencies of IL17A rs8193037 GG homozygote and G allele were significantly higher in the patient group than those in the control group (P<0.001; OR=0.68; 95% CI=0.54-0.85). Stratification analysis showed that the IL17A rs8193037 G allele significantly increased the risk of CAD only among male subjects (P=0.001; OR=0.63; 95% CI=0.47-0.83). After adjustment for conventional risk factors, binary logistic regression analysis showed that the G allele carriers (GG+AG) had significantly increased CAD risk compared with the AA homozygotes (adjusted P<0.001; OR 0.43; 95% CI, 0.33-0.58). ELISA showed augmented IL17A production in plasma of the AMI patients. Based on our data, we speculated that the SNP rs8193037 of IL17A gene is significantly associated with CAD risk in Chinese Han population and the rs8193037 G allele which is associated with increased expression of IL17A in AMI patients may be an independent predictive factor for CAD."
21059344,21059344,NEDD9 is genetically associated with Alzheimer's disease in a Han Chinese population.,"Neural precursor cell-expressed, developmentally downregulated 9 (NEDD9) has been suspected to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) through participating in the formation of neurite-like membrane extensions and neurite outgrowth to affect the number of neuronal cells/synapses in the brain under stressful conditions. A recent large-scale, multi-tiered association study has identified significant association of a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs760678 in the NEDD9 gene with predisposition to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in Caucasians. In order to evaluate the involvement of the NEDD9 polymorphism in the risk of sporadic LOAD, we performed an independent case-control association study to analyze the genotype and allele distributions of the NEDD9 rs760678 polymorphism in a Han Chinese population (383 LOAD cases and 369 healthy controls). There were significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies between LOAD cases and controls (genotype P=0.003, allele P=0.002). After stratification by APOE ε4-carrying status, the C allele of rs760678 was only significantly associated with LOAD in non-APOE ε4 allele carriers (OR=1.43, 95%, CI=1.06-1.94, P=0.024). In addition, a logistic regression analysis also conferred positive association between the SNP rs760678 and LOAD (dominant model: OR=2.10, 95% CI=1.23-3.58, P=0.007; additive model: OR=1.37, 95% CI=1.09-1.74, P=0.008) after adjustment for age, gender, and the APOE ε4 carrier status. The study demonstrated a significant association between the tested SNP and LOAD, indicating that NEDD9 polymorphism has a possible role in changing the genetic susceptibility to LOAD in a Han Chinese population."
21138504,21138504,The transcription factor Pitx3 is a risk modifier for Parkinson's disease in a Chinese Han population.,"The transcription factor Pitx3 plays a crucial role in the development and survival of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons, especially the mDA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The degeneration of these neurons is the pathological hallmark in Parkinson's disease (PD). Several polymorphisms of the Pitx3 gene have been linked with sporadic and early-onset forms of PD, but different studies have given conflicting or inconsistent findings. Amongst the polymorphisms studied, the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3758549, located in the promoter region of Pitx3 gene, is one of the most well-studied but also one of the most controversial. In order to explore the nature of this association in greater detail and in a new ethnic group, we carried out a case-control study of the SNP rs3758549."
21064027,21064027,A novel polymorphism of the lactoferrin gene and its association with milk composition and body traits in dairy goats.,"Milk composition and body measurement traits, influenced by genes and environmental factors, play important roles in value assessments of efficiency and productivity in dairy goats. Lactoferrin (LF), involved in the efficient expression of protein in milk, is also an anabolic factor in skeletal tissue and a potent osteoblast survival factor. Therefore, it is an important candidate gene for milk composition and body measurement trait selection in marker-assisted selection. We employed PCR-SSCP and DNA sequencing to screen the genetic variations of the LF gene in 549 Chinese dairy goats. A novel single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (G198A in exon II) of the LF gene was detected. The frequencies of the AA genotype were 0.0285 and 0.0261 in GZ and SN populations, respectively. Both populations were found to have low levels of polymorphism and were in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium (P < 0.05). We found significant (P < 0.05) associations of the SNP marker with milk protein and acidity in the total population; animals with the AA genotype had higher mean values for milk protein than those with the GA genotype. Animals with genotype AA had higher mean values for withers height than those with genotype GG (P < 0.05). We concluded that this SNP of the LF gene has potential as a genetic marker for milk composition and body traits in dairy goat breeding."
21045271,21045271,The allele frequencies of three polymorphisms in genes involved in homocysteine metabolism in a group of unrelated healthy Singaporeans.,"The cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) 844ins68 polymorphism, methionine synthase (MS) A2756G SNP, and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T SNP are associated with homocysteine (Hcy) level in humans. Elevated Hcy level is considered a risk factor for atherosclerotic diseases among Asian populations. Therefore, the three polymorphisms may vary the risk for developing such diseases in Singaporeans. In this study, the three polymorphisms were determined in a group of unrelated healthy Singaporeans (273 Chinese, 127 Indians, and 156 Malays). Regarding allele frequencies, Indians had the highest frequencies of the CBS insertion allele (2.0%) and the MS 2756G allele (26.4%), while Chinese had the highest MTHFR 677T allele frequency (27.5%). In addition, the MTHFR 677T allele was found significantly lower in Chinese males than in their female counterparts. As the CBS insertion allele was suggested to be associated with lower Hcy level, whereas the MS 2756G allele and the MTHFR T/T genotype were related to higher Hcy level, the MS A/G or G/G genotype and the MTHFR T/T genotype were considered double genetic risk factors for elevated Hcy level. The frequency of such double genetic risk was 0.7% (4 subjects) in the total population consisting of 3 Chinese (1.1%) and 1 Malays (0.6%). No MTHFR T/T genotype was found in Indians. Such results suggested that Chinese could have higher Hcy levels than Malays while the situation for Indians was complicated. Since human Hcy levels are also affected by environmental factors, further studies are required to better evaluate the association between these three polymorphisms and Hcy levels and/or disease susceptibilities in Singaporeans."
21048968,21048968,Genome wide association studies for milk production traits in Chinese Holstein population.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) based on high throughput SNP genotyping technologies open a broad avenue for exploring genes associated with milk production traits in dairy cattle. Motivated by pinpointing novel quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN) across Bos Taurus genome, the present study is to perform GWAS to identify genes affecting milk production traits using current state-of-the-art SNP genotyping technology, i.e., the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip. In the analyses, the five most commonly evaluated milk production traits are involved, including milk yield (MY), milk fat yield (FY), milk protein yield (PY), milk fat percentage (FP) and milk protein percentage (PP). Estimated breeding values (EBVs) of 2,093 daughters from 14 paternal half-sib families are considered as phenotypes within the framework of a daughter design. Association tests between each trait and the 54K SNPs are achieved via two different analysis approaches, a paternal transmission disequilibrium test (TDT)-based approach (L1-TDT) and a mixed model based regression analysis (MMRA). In total, 105 SNPs were detected to be significantly associated genome-wise with one or multiple milk production traits. Of the 105 SNPs, 38 were commonly detected by both methods, while four and 63 were solely detected by L1-TDT and MMRA, respectively. The majority (86 out of 105) of the significant SNPs is located within the reported QTL regions and some are within or close to the reported candidate genes. In particular, two SNPs, ARS-BFGL-NGS-4939 and BFGL-NGS-118998, are located close to the DGAT1 gene (160bp apart) and within the GHR gene, respectively. Our findings herein not only provide confirmatory evidences for previously findings, but also explore a suite of novel SNPs associated with milk production traits, and thus form a solid basis for eventually unraveling the causal mutations for milk production traits in dairy cattle."

All-trans-retinol dehydrogenase (RDH8) is an important enzyme of retinoic acid metabolism. This study aimed to investigate the association of the RDH8 gene with high myopia. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [RDH851 (rs2233789), RDH8E5a (rs1644731), and RDH855b (rs3760753)] were selected, based on the linkage disequilibrium pattern of RDH8 from a previous study, and genotyped for 160 Han Chinese nuclear families with highly myopic (-10 diopters or worse) offspring as well as in an independent group with 166 highly myopic cases (-10 diopters or worse) and 211 controls. Family-based association analysis was performed using the family-based association test (FBAT) package, and genotype relative risk (GRR) was calculated using the GenAssoc program. Population-based association analysis was performed using Chi-square test. These SNPs were in linkage equilibrium with each other. SNPs RDH851 (rs2233789) and RDH8E5a (rs1644731) both did not show association with high myopia. SNP RDH855b (rs3760753) demonstrated significant association (P=0.0269) with a GRR of 0.543 (95% confidence interval=0.304-0.968, P=0.038). The association became statistically insignificant, however, after multiple comparison correction. Haplotype analysis did not show a significant association either. Population-based association analysis also showed no significant association (P>0.05). Our family- and population-based data both suggest that the RDH8 gene is unlikely to be associated with high myopia in Chinese."
21039740,21039740,PADI4 gene polymorphism is not associated with ankylosing spondylitis in Chinese Han population.,"The cause of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) remains unelucidated. Both genetic and environmental factors are suspected playing an important role in AS development. Peptidyl arginine deiminase type IV (PADI4) is a member of gene family that encodes enzymes responsible for the conversion of arginine to citrulline residues. A strong linkage between PADI4 polymorphism and rheumatoid arthritis has been found in Japanese and Korean patients, but there is no association study about PADI4 in AS. We speculated that PADI4 may be a pivotal gene for AS development. So we investigated the PADI4 polymorphisms in AS in Chinese Han population. A total of 316 Chinese AS patients of Han nationality and 439 healthy controls were recruited. Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), PADI4-89 (rs11203366), PADI4-90 (rs11203367), PADI4-92 (rs874881) PADI4-94 (rs2240340) and PADI4-104 (rs1748033), of PADI4 gene were selected, and the major allele frequencies between cases and controls were assessed as 0.571 versus 0.597, 0.565 versus 0.585, 0.565 versus 0.574, 0.446 versus 0.421 and 0.614 versus 620, respectively. No significant differences in the frequency of PADI4 alleles and genotypes between the cases and controls were observed. Two haplotypes ACGGC and GTCGC were significant with AS even after Bonferroni's correction but were with a tiny frequency in AS cases as 1.0% and 1.2%, respectively. These results indicate that PADI4 polymorphisms may not play an important role in the development of AS in Chinese Han population."
21034624,21034624,T allele at site 6007 of bone morphogenetic protein-4 gene increases genetic susceptibility to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament in male Chinese Han population.,"Several candidate genes of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) susceptibility have been identified, but their polymorphisms account for only a small percent of the total variance. Bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) is a potent ectopic ossification inducing factor. BMP4 protein and mRNA are present in cells from OPLL patients, but not non-OPLL controls. A single nucleotide polymorphism of 6007C>T(rs17563) of BMP4 has been reported to affect bone density in postmenopausal women. Thus, BMP4 may function in OPLL development. Appropriately, the relationship between BMP4 polymorphisms and OPLL was investigated."

The purpose of this study was to determine if BLID and LOC399959 are associated with high myopia in Chinese Han subjects."
20977898,20977898,Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) polymorphisms and risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Han Chinese.,"Chronic mitochondria DNA (mtDNA) damage and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been proved to contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) plays an important role in the maintenance of mtDNA integrity. Recently, some studies suggested two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1937 and rs2306604) in the TFAM gene are associated with sporadic late-onset AD (LOAD) in Caucasians. To explore the correlation between TFAM gene and LOAD, we performed a case-control study in a large Chinese cohort consisting of 394 patients and 390 healthy controls. The results showed that there were significant differences in genotype (P=0.03) and allele (P=0.04) frequencies of the SNP rs1937 between LOAD patients and controls. The minor C allele of rs1937 acted as a moderate protective factor of LOAD (P=0.04, odds ratios/OR=0.76). The logistic regression analysis also suggested an association of LOAD with SNP rs1937 (dominant model: P=0.03, OR=0.71; recessive model: P=0.02, OR=0.25; additive model: P=0.01, OR=0.68). No significant association was observed between rs2306604 and LOAD. Haplotype analysis identified the haplotype CC as a protective factor of LOAD (P=0.038, OR=0.76). This study provides the evidence that variations in TFAM are involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic LOAD in the Han Chinese population."

20972595,20972595,Association of an intronic SNP of SLC2A9 gene with serum uric acid levels in the Chinese male Han population by high-resolution melting method.,"SLC2A9 is a novel identified urate transporter influencing uric acid metabolism. It has been suggested that the single-nucleotide polymorphisms in SLC2A9 may affect the serum UA levels. The present study was designed to investigate rs6855911 polymorphism in intron 7 of SLC2A9 in a total of 372 Chinese male subjects. We examined 166 gout patients, as well as 206 healthy male volunteers in this study. DNA was purified from peripheral blood, and the rs6855911 polymorphism was evaluated using high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis and direct sequencing. Demographic and clinical data obtained from the patients and controls among the genotype groups were analyzed. A/A and A/G genotypes were unambiguously distinguished with HRM technology. The occurrence of the homozygous type (G/G) was completely absent among the study population. The prevalence of the A/A and A/G genotype was 96.0% and 4.0%, respectively. Genotyping based on HRM was fully concordant with sequencing. The G allele frequency was significantly higher in the low-uric-acid group than in the high-uric-acid group. The genotype distribution and allele frequencies were not significantly different between gout and control subjects (p = 0.04). However, serum uric acid levels in the A/G genotype subjects were significantly lower than those with the A/A genotypes (p < 0.01). Rapid and accurate genotyping analysis of SLC2A9 can be done with HRM. The polymorphism rs6855911 in SLC2A9 may be a genetic marker to assess risk of hyperuricemia among Chinese male Han population."

20963503,20963503,Relationship between surfactant protein A polymorphisms and allergic rhinitis in a Chinese Han population.,"The development of allergic rhinitis is considered to be determined by the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Surfactant protein A (SP-A), a member of the collectin family of proteins, plays an important role in immune regulation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between SP-A polymorphisms and allergic rhinitis. We conducted a case-control association study on a Chinese Han population, comprising 216 adult individuals with AR and 84 healthy controls. A total of 9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapped to the SP-A were genotyped using PCR-based molecular identification methods. The frequency of A allele at amino acid 223 in the patient group was significantly higher than that in the control group after correcting for multiple testing (P = 0.006). The 1A(2) allele haplotype in SFTPA2 was associated with decreased risk for allergic rhinitis, after applying Bonferroni corrections (P = 0.003). However, genetic variants of the SFTPA1 genes were not found to be associated with AR. In addition, no significant associations were established between any of the 9 SFTPA gene polymorphisms and the skin-prick test responses (P > 0.05). Further, no association was established between the 9 SNP loci and the levels of total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) (P > 0.05). These results indicate that the gene polymorphism at the residue 223 in the carbohydrate recognition domain of SFTPA2 may be a genetic marker for the development of AR in the adult Chinese Han population."
20951388,20951388,Genetic association of PICALM polymorphisms with Alzheimer's disease in Han Chinese.,"PICALM might play an important role in AD pathology through participating in altering synaptic vesicle cycling or APP endocytosis. A recent genome-wide study (GWAS) identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3851179 in the 5' to the PICALM gene strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Caucasians. In order to assess the involvement of the PICALM polymorphism in the risk of developing late-onset AD (LOAD), we analyzed the genotype and allele distributions of these three polymorphisms in 609 Han Chinese subjects. Our data showed no significant association between the PICALM rs3851179 polymorphism and LOAD (genotype distribution: P=0.43; allele frequency: P=0.25, odds ratio=0.87, 95% confidence interval=0.68 to 1.10), even after statistical adjustment for age, gender and apolipoprotein E (APOE) status. Our results suggest that the PICALM polymorphism may not play a major role in the development of LOAD in the Han Chinese population."
20959387,20959387,Association of rs10830963 and rs10830962 SNPs in the melatonin receptor (MTNR1B) gene among Han Chinese women with polycystic ovary syndrome.,"The aim of the present study was to determine whether or not the 'melatonin receptor (MTNR1B)' gene polymorphisms are associated with a predisposition for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs10830963 and rs10830962, in the MTNR1B gene were detected in 526 patients with PCOS and 547 healthy Chinese Han women. The association between MTNR1B gene variants and plasma glucose and insulin levels during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and hormone levels was investigated. The frequencies of three genotypes and two allelotypes of the SNP, rs10830963, differed significantly between women with PCOS and healthy controls (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). The SNP, rs10830963, was significantly associated with higher fasting plasma glucose concentrations (P < 0.001) and increased the area under the curve of plasma glucose levels during the OGTT (P < 0.001), as well as increased homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; P = 0.027). No significant differences were observed in the genotypes and allele distributions of rs10830962 polymorphisms between the PCOS and the control groups (P = 0.311 and P = 0.178, respectively). There was no significant difference in the clinical and the metabolic characteristics in women with PCOS with different genotypes in the SNP, rs10830962 (all P > 0.005). The present study suggest that the SNP, rs10830963, in the MTNR1B gene is not only associated with susceptibility to PCOS, but also contributes to the PCOS phenotype."

20887380,20887380,Association of the CD226 single nucleotide polymorphism with systemic lupus erythematosus in the Chinese Han population.,"A novel non-synonymous (Gly307Ser) variant, rs763361, of the CD226 gene on chromosome 18q22 was recently shown to be associated with multiple autoimmune diseases. Taking into consideration that different autoimmune diseases may share some common pathogenic pathways, in this study we performed case-control studies to assess any genetic linkage with systemic lupus erythemtosus (SLE). An association between the Gly307Ser single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and susceptibility to SLE was identified. The TT genotype [odds ratio (OR) = 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07-3.01, P = 0.025] and the T allele (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.05-1.74, P = 0.018) of the rs763361 SNP were associated with the risk of SLE. This finding indicates that polymorphism of Gly307Ser (rs763361) in exon 7 of the CD226 gene may be associated with the development of SLE."

20874233,20874233,"Association of a MYCL1 single nucleotide polymorphism, rs3134613, with susceptibility to diffuse-type gastric cancer and with differentiation of gastric cancer in a southeast Chinese population.","A MYCL1 single nucleotide polymorphism, rs3134613, has been reported to play an important role in many cancers. However, its involvement in gastric cancer is controversial. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of rs3134613 on the development and progression of gastric cancer in a southeast Chinese population. Genotypes were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 317 gastric cancer patients and 200 cancer-free controls. Data show that the risk of diffuse-type gastric cancer in carriers with the T allele (T/T or G/T genotype) was higher than that in carriers with the G/G genotype (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.601, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.431-4.895, p = 0.003). The risk of diffuse-type gastric cancer in T allele carriers was higher than that in G allele carriers (adjusted OR = 1.594, 95% CI = 1.157-2.286, p = 0.009). The risk of poorly differentiated cancer in carriers with the T allele (T/T or G/T genotype) was higher than that in carriers with the G/G genotype (adjusted OR = 1.963, 95% CI = 1.156-3.325, p = 0.015). The results demonstrate that rs3134613 is associated with susceptibility to diffuse-type gastric cancer and with differentiation of gastric cancer. rs3134613 may be used as a potential marker to identify individuals who are at high risk of diffuse-type gastric cancer."
20929600,20929600,Beta(2)-adrenergic receptor haplotype/polymorphisms and asthma susceptibility and clinical phenotype in a Chinese Han population.,"Association and linkage studies of beta₂-adrenergic receptor (beta₂AR) polymorphisms in relation to the expression of asthmatic phenotypes and immune regulatory mechanisms have shown inconsistent results. This study was designed to analyze the relationship of particular combinations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or haplotypes of the beta₂AR gene with bronchial asthma, bronchodilator response, and total IgE. By direct DNA sequencing, five SNPs (in positions -47, -20, 46, 79, and 252) of beta₂AR gene were determined and combined with haplotypes in 201 asthmatic patients and 276 normal controls recruited from the Chinese Han population. Significantly higher bronchodilator response was observed in patients with homozygotic genotype 46A/A (13.40 ± 3.48%), compared with those with homo-46G/G (7.25 ± 3.11%) and heterozygotes 46A/G (7.39 ± 3.14%), respectively (p < 0.0001). There was also a significant difference in bronchodilator response when beta₂AR haplotypes were analyzed (p = 0.003). From two common SNPs at positions 46A/G and 79C/G, we had determined three haplotypes that constructed six haplotype pairs. Comparison of the mean delta forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁) values for the six haplotype pairs showed significant difference. Subjects homozygous for 46A/79C (Arg16/Gln27) had the highest deltaFEV₁ (13.40 ± 3.48%) and those with 46G/79C (Gly16/Gln27) homozygote had the lowest (6.43 ± 0.55%). The two SNP haplotype pairs were significantly associated with delta FEV₁ (p < 0.0001). Significantly higher total IgE levels were found in patients with homozygotic carriers of 79C genotypes (p = 0.022) and homozygotic haplotype -47 T/-20 T/46 A/79 C/252 G (p < 0.0001). These results indicate that the manifestation of asthma might be affected by either an individual beta₂AR SNPs or beta₂AR haplotype."

The LOX gene has also been shown to inhibit the transforming activity of Ras oncogene signaling. Recently, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of LOX G473A (rs1800449) has been demonstrated to be associated with increased risk of breast cancer in African American women. In this hospital-based case-control study, the association of LOX polymorphism with breast cancer susceptibility in Chinese Han population was investigated. In total, 238 female patients with breast cancer and 234 age-matched healthy controls recruited were genotyped. We found a significant difference in the frequency of the LOX G473A genotype between the breast cancer and control groups. Individuals with GA genotype showed a 2.79-fold (95% confidence interval = 1.87-4.16) increased risk of breast cancer compared with subjects carrying GG genotype (p < 0.001). Further statistical analysis revealed that this polymorphism was an independent parameter with regard to other variables that are significantly associated with breast cancer, that is, age, menopausal status, estrogen exposure interval, expression status of estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor. These findings suggest that the LOX 473 GA genotype is independently associated with increased risk of breast cancer in Chinese female population."

20829310,20829310,"Polymorphisms of PXK are associated with autoantibody production, but not disease risk, of systemic lupus erythematosus in Chinese mainland population.","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex immune disease. The genetic variation in the PXK gene was found to associate with SLE in Caucasian populations. However, the association of rs6445975 with SLE has not been extensively studied in a Chinese mainland population. A total of 288 SLE patients and 357 controls were recruited. Unlabeled probe-based high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) was used in genotyping. HRMA with unlabeled probe successfully distinguished all genotypes. Neither genotype nor allele frequencies of SNP rs6445975 showed statistically significant differences between SLE patients and controls. The association of SNP rs6445975 with the diagnostic criteria of SLE was also examined. No obvious association was observed between rs6445975 and the incidence of clinical symptoms. However, the minor allele (G) of rs6445975 was found to significantly associate with increased abnormalities of anti-Smith (p = 0.004, odds ratio (OR) = 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.22-3.09), anti-Ro (p = 0.015, OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.10-2.58), anti-La (p = 0.008, OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.17-2.93) and C3C4 (p = 0.007, OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.17-2.74).

20709678,20709678,[Association and meta-analysis of ENPP1 K121Q with type 2 diabetes in Han Chinese.].,"Multiple meta-analyses in Europeans showed that ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism was associated with type 2 diabetes. However, no association in Japanese, Korean, and Chinese in Taiwan, and inconsistent results in mainland Chinese were reported. In this study, the single nucleotide polymorphism K121Q of the ENPP1gene was genotyped in 539 type 2 diabetes patients and 404 healthy controls. No difference was observed in the genotypic and alle-lic frequencies of ENPP1 K121Q between the cases and the controls. Logistic regression analysis with adjustment of sex, age, and BMI suggested that the XQ genotype was significantly associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes (OR=1.5, 95%CI: 1.39-1.62, P<0.001). Sub-group analysis by gender revealed that the association between ENPP1 K121Q and type 2 diabetes was observed only in women (Q: 12.4% vs. 6.1%, P=0.001; XQ: 23.7% vs. 11.7%, P=0.001). Our results suggest that the association of ENPP1 K121Q with type 2 diabetes in Hubei Han Chinese population is more evident in women. The first meta-analysis of 10 Chinese studies indicated that the Q allele increased the risk of type 2 diabetes (OR=1.42, P=0.042)."
20714865,20714865,Association between SNP rs10569304 on the second expressed region of hole gene and the congenital heart disease.,"The correlation of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10569304 on the second expressed region of hole gene and congenital heart disease (CHD) of human being, and the effect of hole gene on CHD were investigated. 179 patients with CHD as CHD group and 183 healthy people as control group were selected in the case-control study. DNA was abstracted from the peripheral blood by phenol-chloroform method. Primer was designed for the flanking sequence of SNP rs10569304 on the second expressed region of hole gene. The genotype was identified by PCR degenerative acrylamide electrophoresis with amplification products. Then the three amplification products received sequencing. By chi-square test, the genotype frequency and allele frequency in CHD group and control group were analyzed. There was insertion-deletion (GCC/-) of SNP rs10569304 which corresponded to alleles of A and B in Southern Chinese people. The genotype frequency and allele frequency in control group and CHD group were met the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. By chi-square test, in control group and CHD group, the genotype frequency of AA (insertion homozygous), AB (insertion-deletion heterozygous) and BB (deletion homozygous) was 21.31%, 54.09%, 24.59% and 16.75%, 46.36%, 36.87%, respectively. The distributional difference of genotype frequency had statistical significance (chi2=6.51, P<0.05); The allele frequency of A and B was 48.36% and 51.64% in control group, 39.94% and 60.06% in CHD group, respectively. The distributional difference of allele frequency had statistical significance (chi2=5.20, P<0.05). Meanwhile, by contrast with the control group, the BB genotype frequency and B allele frequency in CHD group was higher, but the AA and AB frequency was lower. There was higher risk to suffer from CHD involving B allele. BB genotype had 1.907-fold increased risk of developing CHD according to AA genotype (P<0.05). It is concluded that there is insertion-deletion (GCC/-) of SNP rs10569304 in the Southern Chinese people, and the people whose hole gene involving BB genotype have higher risk to suffering from CHD."

However, to our knowledge, whether they play roles in the maldevelopment of synaptic pathways in schizophrenia has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to examine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms rs11136000 within the CLU gene and rs3851179 within the CALM gene, were associated with schizophrenia. Polymorphisms rs11136000 and rs3851179 were analyzed among 184 Chinese patients with schizophrenia and 162 healthy controls. The high-resolution melting method was used to genotype the two loci. Patients with schizophrenia and with family history showed a significant increase of allele C frequency in rs11136000 in comparison to normal controls (p = 0.03). In addition, the C allele frequency was also higher in patients with negative symptoms (p = 0.04). In contrast, allele and genotype frequencies of rs3851179 did not show significant differences between patients and normal subjects or between patients with different symptoms. The results of this study show that polymorphism of the CLU gene may confer symptomatic specificity in schizophrenia, whereas polymorphism of the CALM gene does not affect susceptibility to schizophrenia."

A recent genome-wide association study reported that a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs5984894) in the gene encoding Pcdh11X was associated with susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in Caucasians. In order to assess the involvement of the PCDH11X polymorphism in the risk of developing AD in Chinese, we analyzed the genotype and allele distributions of the PCDH11X rs5984894 polymorphism in a Han Chinese population (355 LOAD cases and 399 healthy controls). Our results failed to find any significant association between the tested SNP and LOAD, indicating that PCDH11X gene polymorphism does not play a major role in the genetic predisposition to LOAD in this Han Chinese population."

The Kazakh ethnic group is characterized by a relatively high prevalence of hypertension. Previous research indicates that the FURIN gene may play a pivotal role in the renin-angiotensin system and maintaining the sodium-electrolyte balance. Because these systems influence blood pressure regulation, we considered FURIN as a candidate gene for hypertension. The purpose of this study was to systematically investigate the association between genetic variations in the FURIN gene and essential hypertension in a Xinjiang Kazakh population."

The products of ALOX12 reactions serve as endogenous ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARG). The activation of the PPARG pathway in marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitors stimulates adipogenesis and inhibits osteoblastogenesis. Our objective was to determine whether polymorphisms in the ALOX12 gene were associated with variations in peak bone mineral density (BMD) and obesity phenotypes in young Chinese men."
20700438,20700438,The 5p15.33 locus is associated with risk of lung adenocarcinoma in never-smoking females in Asia.,"Genome-wide association studies of lung cancer reported in populations of European background have identified three regions on chromosomes 5p15.33, 6p21.33, and 15q25 that have achieved genome-wide significance with p-values of 10(-7) or lower. These studies have been performed primarily in cigarette smokers, raising the possibility that the observed associations could be related to tobacco use, lung carcinogenesis, or both. Since most women in Asia do not smoke, we conducted a genome-wide association study of lung adenocarcinoma in never-smoking females (584 cases, 585 controls) among Han Chinese in Taiwan and found that the most significant association was for rs2736100 on chromosome 5p15.33 (p = 1.30 x 10(-11)). This finding was independently replicated in seven studies from East Asia totaling 1,164 lung adenocarcinomas and 1,736 controls (p = 5.38 x 10(-11)). A pooled analysis achieved genome-wide significance for rs2736100. This SNP marker localizes to the CLPTM1L-TERT locus on chromosome 5p15.33 (p = 2.60 x 10(-20), allelic risk = 1.54, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.41-1.68). Risks for heterozygote and homozygote carriers of the minor allele were 1.62 (95% CI; 1.40-1.87), and 2.35 (95% CI: 1.95-2.83), respectively. In summary, our results show that genetic variation in the CLPTM1L-TERT locus of chromosome 5p15.33 is directly associated with the risk of lung cancer, most notably adenocarcinoma."
20697102,20697102,Analysis of GWAS-linked loci in Parkinson disease reaffirms PARK16 as a susceptibility locus.,"A genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the Japanese population identified 2 new Parkinson disease (PD) susceptibility loci on 1q32 (PARK16) (OMIM 613164) and BST1.

20690084,20690084,No association of polymorphisms in the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3 with rheumatoid arthritis in the Chinese Han population.,"Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3 is a key negative regulator of cytokine signaling that inhibits the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway; there are reports describing its role in attenuating arthritis through SOCS-3 overexpression. We examined the relationship between polymorphisms in the coding sequence and promoter region of SOCS-3 and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a Chinese Han population. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the SOCS-3 5' region: -1044 C>A within the promoter region and rs12953258 (-920 C>A) in the 5'UTR (exon 2) of SOCS-3 were studied by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and tetra-ARMS-PCR in 100 RA patients and 100 healthy adults. The prevalence of the homozygous genotype -1044 CC was 100% in both RA and control groups. The heterozygous genotype (-920 C>A) was present in 89% of RA and in 82% of the control group, which is significantly different from the distribution in Western people. There was no transmission disequilibrium between these two SNPs (r(2) = 0.000). We did not detect significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies for either of these SNPs between the RA group and controls (P > 0.05). There was no association between rheumatoid factor and SOCS-3 SNP rs12953258 (P = 0.258). We conclude that SOCS-3 polymorphism is not a genetic risk factor for RA in Chinese patients."

20680470,20680470,A functional varient in microRNA-146a is associated with risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in Chinese Han.,"MicroRNAs are a new class of non-proteincoding, small RNAs that function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. They participate in diverse biological pathways and function as gene regulators. A G>C polymorphism (rs2910164), which is located in the sequence of miR-146a precursor, results in a change from G:U to C:U in its stem region. However, it remains largely unknown whether this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may alter esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) susceptibility. In the current study, we evaluated association between rs2910164 and ESCC susceptibility in a case-control study of 444 sporadic ESCC patients and 468 matched cancer-free controls in a Chinese Han population. Compared with rs2910164 variant genotype CC, genotype GG was associated with increased risk of ESCC (Odds Ratio, 2.39, 95% Confidence Interval, 1.36-4.20). In the smokers, the risk of rs2910164 GG genotype was more notable (Odds Ratio, 3.17, 95% Confidence Interval, 1.71-4.46). In the stratification analyses, we also found there was a strong correlation between rs2910164 C/G variant and the clinical TNM stage (P < 0.01). These findings suggest that this functional SNP in pre-miR-146a could contribute to ESCC susceptibility and clinical outcome."
20733074,20733074,Sex-specific association of X-linked Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) with male systemic lupus erythematosus.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem, autoimmune disease that predominantly affects women. Previous findings that duplicated Toll-like receptor 7 (Tlr7) promotes lupus-like disease in male BXSB mice prompted us to evaluate TLR7 in human SLE. By using a candidate gene approach, we identified and replicated association of a TLR7 3'UTR SNP, rs3853839 (G/C), with SLE in 9,274 Eastern Asians (P(combined) = 6.5 x 10(-10)), with a stronger effect in male than female subjects [odds ratio, male vs. female = 2.33 (95% CI = 1.64-3.30) vs. 1.24 (95% CI = 1.14-1.34); P = 4.1 x 10(-4)]. G-allele carriers had increased TLR7 transcripts and more pronounced IFN signature than C-allele carriers; heterozygotes had 2.7-fold higher transcripts of G-allele than C-allele. These data established a functional polymorphism in type I IFN pathway gene TLR7 predisposing to SLE, especially in Chinese and Japanese male subjects."
20680283,20680283,Down-regulated expression of IKZF1 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multi-system autoimmune disease with complex genetic inheritance. IKZF1 was established as a new susceptibility gene for SLE in a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) in Chinese Han population. In order to examine whether expression levels of IKZF1 contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE, we estimated IKZF1 mRNA expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) via fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 60 patients with SLE and 60 controls. We also explored whether the IKZF1 mRNA expression levels are associated with the variant of the SNP rs4917014 and the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). The expression levels of IKZF1 mRNA in patients with SLE were significantly decreased compared with those in healthy controls (P<0.001). No significant differences were found between IKZF1 mRNA expression levels and SLEDAI scores, SNP rs4917014. Our results suggest that decreased expression of IKZF1 mRNA may be correlated with the pathogenesis of SLE."
20683652,20683652,A non-synonymous polymorphism Thr115Met in the EpCAM gene is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in Chinese population.,"As a tumor-associated antigen and a surface marker of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) plays an important role in not only cell adhesion, morphogenesis, metastases but also carcinogenesis. A non-synonymous C/T polymorphism (rs1126497) in exon3 of EpCAM causes a transition of 115 amino acid from Met to Thr. Another polymorphism (A/G, rs1421) in the 3'UTR causes loss of has-miR-1183 binding. A multiple independent case-control analysis was performed to assess the association between EpCAM genotypes and breast cancer risk. We observed that the variant EpCAM genotype (rs1126497 CT, and TT) was associated with substantially increased risk of breast cancer. Genotyping a total of 1643 individuals with breast cancer and 1818 control subjects in Eastern and Southern Chinese populations showed that rs1126497 CT + TT genotype had an odd ratio of 1.40 (95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.57) for developing breast cancer compared with CC genotype. The allele T increases the risk of breast cancer in a dose-dependent response manner (P (trend) < 0.001). Moreover, compared to breast cancer patients carrying the CC genotype, the EpCAM SNP rs1126497 CT or TT carrier was significantly associated with early breast cancer onset (P = 0.0023). However, no significant difference was found in genotype frequencies at the rs1421 A/G site between cases and controls. These findings suggest that M115T polymorphism in EpCAM may be a genetic modifier for developing breast cancer."

Accumulated evidence suggests an association between MMP-1, MMP-7, and MMP-9 functional gene polymorphisms with several tumors. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at MMP-1 16071G/2G, MMP-7 181A/G, and MMP-9 279R/Q genes with CRC in the southwest Chinese Han population. The study used 237 CRC patients and 252 normal control matched by age and sex from Sichuan province in China. Samples were genotyped using both polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing. We found significant differences in the genotype and allele frequency of MMP-9 279 R/Q between the case and control group. Individuals who carried MMP-9 279 R allele were more susceptible to CRC (odds ratio = 1.737, 95% confidence interval = 1.323-2.281, p < 0.001). Moreover, the RR genotype of MMP-9 279 R/Q was associated with an increased risk of CRC compared with the QQ genotype (odds ratio = 2.213, 95% confidence interval = 1.248-3.926, p = 0.006). However, there were no significant differences in the genotype and allele frequency of the MMP-1 16071G/2G and MMP-7 181 A/G between the case and control group, and the latter may be due to lower minor allele frequency. The MMP-9 279R/Q alleles and genotypes may be associated with the risk of CRC in Han Chinese."
20664545,20664545,"Relationships among adiponectin gene polymorphisms, proteinuria and increased blood pressure in the context of placental diseases.","The etiology and pathogenesis of preeclampsia remain unclear. Little is known about the possible impact of adiponectin gene polymorphisms on the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. In this study, we analyzed the association of two adiponectin single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with preeclampsia. One hundred eighty-eight Han Chinese pregnant women were enrolled (81 normal-term, 20 mild preeclampsia and 87 severe cases). Serum adiponectin level, and adiponectin exon 2 SNP +45T/G (rs2241766) genotype and intron 2 SNP +276G/T genotype (rs1501299) and their allele distributions were tested with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and PCR-restriction-fragment length polymorphism, respectively. There were no significant differences among the three groups (P>0.05) in genotype distribution or allele frequencies of either SNP. Systolic pressure and 24-h urinary protein were lower in TT homozygotes than those in TG+GG patients at SNP +45T/G in the severe preeclamptic group (P<0.05). Furthermore, blood pressure, serum adiponectin level and 24-h urinary protein were lower in GG homozygotes than those in TG+TT patients at SNP +276G/T in the severe preeclamptic group (P<0.05). The risk of high blood pressure (≥160/110 mm Hg) and of high serum adiponectin in T-allele carriers at +276G/T in the severe preeclamptic group were 5.345 and 5.818 times higher, respectively, compared with GG patients. These data suggest that adiponectin +45T/G and +276G/T polymorphisms are associated with important clinical manifestations of preeclampsia and that polymorphism +276G/T is associated with serum adiponectin level. Taken together, these findings suggest that adiponectin gene polymorphism is involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia."

Recently, a functional polymorphism (rs143383) of the 5'-untranslated region of GDF5 (Growth/Differentiation Factor 5) - previously reported to be associated with osteoarthritis - has been associated with CDH in a Chinese population. The aim of our study was to determine whether GDF5, known to be involved in bone, joint and cartilage morphogenesis, is also associated with CDH in Caucasians."
20652317,20652317,Evidence of gene-environment interaction for the IRF6 gene and maternal multivitamin supplementation in controlling the risk of cleft lip with/without cleft palate.,"Although multiple genes have been identified as genetic risk factors for isolated, non-syndromic cleft lip with/without cleft palate (CL/P), a complex and heterogeneous birth defect, interferon regulatory factor 6 gene (IRF6) is one of the best documented genetic risk factors. In this study, we tested for association between markers in IRF6 and CL/P in 326 Chinese case-parent trios, considering gene-environment interaction for two common maternal exposures, and parent-of-origin effects. CL/P case-parent trios from three sites in mainland China and Taiwan were genotyped for 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IRF6. The transmission disequilibrium test was used to test for marginal effects of individual SNPs. We used PBAT to screen the SNPs and haplotypes for gene-environment (G×E) interaction and conditional logistic regression models to quantify effect sizes for SNP-environment interaction. After Bonferroni correction, 14 SNPs showed statistically significant association with CL/P. Evidence of G×E interaction was found for both maternal exposures, multivitamin supplementation and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Two SNPs showed evidence of interaction with multivitamin supplementation in conditional logistic regression models (rs2076153 nominal P=0.019, rs17015218 nominal P=0.012). In addition, rs1044516 yielded evidence for interaction with maternal ETS (nominal P=0.041). Haplotype analysis using PBAT also suggested interaction between SNPs in IRF6 and both multivitamin supplementation and ETS. However, no evidence for maternal genotypic effects or significant parent-of-origin effects was seen in these data. These results suggest IRF6 gene may influence risk of CL/P through interaction with multivitamin supplementation and ETS in the Chinese population."

20621019,20621019,"Polymorphisms in PPARD, PPARG and APM1 associated with four types of traditional Chinese medicine constitutions.","Based on the theory of constitution of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the human population is divided into nine constitutions including one balanced constitution (Normality) and eight unbalanced constitutions (Yang-deficiency, Yin-deficiency, Phlegm-wetness, Qi-deficiency, Wetness-heat, Blood stasis, Depressed constitution, and Inherited special constitution). Different constitutions have specific metabolic features and different susceptibility to certain diseases. However, whether a genetic basis accounts for such constitution classification is yet to be determined. Here we performed a genetic study to assess the association between genetic variations of metabolic genes including PPARD, PPARG and APM1 and the constitutions. A total of 233 individuals of the Han population in China were classified into four groups, Normality, Yang-deficiency, Yin-deficiency and Phlegm-wetness with whom 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the three genes were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Biased distribution of PPARD rs2267669 and rs2076167, APM1 rs7627128 and rs1063539 in Yang-deficiency, PPARG Pro12Ala in Yin-deficiency and PPARD rs2076167, APM1 rs266729 and rs7627128 in Phlegm-wetness were observed. The frequencies of Haplotype13 (Hap13) of PPARG in Yin-deficiency, Hap25 of APM1 in Yang-deficiency and Hap2 of PPARD and Hap14 of PPARG in Phlegm-wetness, were significantly different from those in Normality, suggesting those might be group-associated haplotypes. These results suggested that single SNP and haplotypes of PPARD, PPARG and APM1 may underlie the genetic basis of the constitutions classified in TCM."
20661439,20661439,Ancestry-shift refinement mapping of the C6orf97-ESR1 breast cancer susceptibility locus.,"We used an approach that we term ancestry-shift refinement mapping to investigate an association, originally discovered in a GWAS of a Chinese population, between rs2046210[T] and breast cancer susceptibility. The locus is on 6q25.1 in proximity to the C6orf97 and estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) genes. We identified a panel of SNPs that are correlated with rs2046210 in Chinese, but not necessarily so in other ancestral populations, and genotyped them in breast cancer case:control samples of Asian, European, and African origin, a total of 10,176 cases and 13,286 controls. We found that rs2046210[T] does not confer substantial risk of breast cancer in Europeans and Africans (OR = 1.04, P = 0.099, and OR = 0.98, P = 0.77, respectively). Rather, in those ancestries, an association signal arises from a group of less common SNPs typified by rs9397435. The rs9397435[G] allele was found to confer risk of breast cancer in European (OR = 1.15, P = 1.2 x 10(-3)), African (OR = 1.35, P = 0.014), and Asian (OR = 1.23, P = 2.9 x 10(-4)) population samples. Combined over all ancestries, the OR was 1.19 (P = 3.9 x 10(-7)), was without significant heterogeneity between ancestries (P(het) = 0.36) and the SNP fully accounted for the association signal in each ancestry. Haplotypes bearing rs9397435[G] are well tagged by rs2046210[T] only in Asians. The rs9397435[G] allele showed associations with both estrogen receptor positive and estrogen receptor negative breast cancer. Using early-draft data from the 1,000 Genomes project, we found that the risk allele of a novel SNP (rs77275268), which is closely correlated with rs9397435, disrupts a partially methylated CpG sequence within a known CTCF binding site. These studies demonstrate that shifting the analysis among ancestral populations can provide valuable resolution in association mapping."
20613781,20613781,Effects of protein coding polymorphisms in the kallikrein 1 gene on baseline blood pressure and antihypertensive response to irbesartan in Chinese hypertensive patients.,"The aim of this study was to determine the association between coding variants in the human tissue kallikrein 1 (KLK1) gene and baseline blood pressure (BP) and antihypertensive response to irbesartan treatment in Chinese hypertensive patients. A total of 1061 hypertensives were recruited and received daily oral dosage of 150 mg irbesartan for 4 weeks. Predose BPs, BPs and blood irbesartan concentrations at postdose on the 28th day were all measured. Common functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the KLK1 gene were genotyped. On the basis of the HapMap data of Han Chinese in the Beijing population, two non-synonymous polymorphisms with minor allele frequency>0.1, SNP rs5517 (Glu162Lys) and rs5516 (Gln121Glu), were selected. Those with GG genotype in the rs5516 locus had higher average baseline systolic BP (SBP) than CC subjects (β±s.e.: 5.0±2.3, P=0.033); and no associations of rs5517 with baseline BP (diastolic BP (DBP) and SBP) and BP responses, or rs5516 with baseline DBP and BP response were observed. In a haplotype-based association test for the KLK1 gene, the Haplo-special score analyses identified that haplotype AG was marginally associated with SBP response (specific score: 1.75 for P=0.08), but not with DBP response. We did not find any associations between haplotypes (GC and AC) and BP responses. The Haplo-GLM analyses showed that, compared with haplotype GC subjects, the subjects with haplotype AG had a marginally greater SBP response (adjusted β±s.e.: 1.81±0.97, P=0.06), but DBP response did not differ. This study suggests that rs5516 in the KLK1 gene may be involved in the development of essential hypertension and in the regulation of SBP-lowering response to irbesartan in Chinese hypertensives."
20627730,20627730,The relationship between ADAM17 promoter polymorphisms and sporadic Alzheimer's disease in a Northern Chinese Han population.,"The deposition of amyloid beta peptides (Abeta) in the brain is crucial in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) 17 cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP) within the Abeta sequence and, therefore, precludes the formation of neurotoxic Abeta. To explore the correlation between the ADAM17 promoter and sporadic AD (SAD), a case-control study was conducted in a Northern Chinese Han population. The ADAM17 gene promoter region was screened, resulting in five known and one novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP): -1672C/T (rs11689958), -1638T/G (rs1524668), -1437T/C (rs11684747), -1333C/T (rs12474969), -172T/C (rs12692386) and -154C/A. Using direct sequencing, genotypes were determined in 403 patients who had SAD and 323 control participants. No association was observed between these polymorphisms and SAD. These data indicated that, in a Northern Chinese Han population, SNP in the ADAM17 promoter do not influence the risk of SAD."
20599404,20599404,An association study between SNAP-25 gene and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.,"Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most common behavioral disorder in childhood. Genetic associations have been reported between ADHD and polymorphic variants within or near dopamine pathway genes. Synaptosomal-associated protein, 25 kDa (SNAP-25), a presynaptic plasma membrane protein with an integral role in synaptic transmission, has shown association with ADHD in several datasets. We characterized two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs362549, rs363006) and one microsatellite [5'-UTR (TAAA)(n)] of SNAP-25. The association of these variants with ADHD was assessed in 102 trios collected from 90 male and 12 female probands. Transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) analysis showed that none of the polymorphic alleles were preferentially transmitted to the probands. Quantitative analysis was also conducted to assess the relationship between these marker alleles and the severity of ADHD symptoms. Analysis of the DSM-IV subtypes indicated that a significant association was identified between SNP rs362549 and ADHD subtypes (P = 0.0047). This is the first report of an association between SNAP-25 and ADHD in Chinese subjects of Han descent. We still support the premise that SNAP-25 is a genetic susceptibility factor for ADHD."
20604892,20604892,Association of the PTPN22 gene (-1123G > C) polymorphism with rheumatoid arthritis in Chinese patients.,"This study aimed at examining the association of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the protein tyrosine phosphatase gene (PTPN22) with the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a Chinese population. A total of 200 RA patients and age and gender-matched healthy controls were recruited. Their genotypes and allelic frequency were determined by the TaqMan-MGB probe-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The frequencies of the CC genotype and C allele in RA patient group were significantly higher than that of controls (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) with an odds ratio of 1.67, respectively. These data suggest, the CC genotype and C allele of the -1123G > C in the PTPN22 gene are associated with an increased risk for RA in Chinese population. Therefore, the CC genotype and C allele of the -1123G > C in the PTPN22 gene may be used as a genetic marker for the predisposition of RA in Chinese."
20648603,20648603,Association of NKG2D genetic polymorphism with susceptibility to chronic hepatitis B in a Han Chinese population.,"Natural killer (NK) cells are important antiviral effectors of innate immunity because of their contribution to virus elimination. NK cell-mediated immunological reaction to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection depends on a fine balance between inhibitory and activating receptors. The aim of the study was to investigate genetic polymorphisms in NK cell receptors (NKR)-KLRD1 (CD94), KLRK1 (NKG2D), KLRC4 (NKG2F), and KLRC1 (NKG2A)-to evaluate the association of NKR genetic polymorphisms with susceptibility to chronic hepatitis B in a Han Chinese population. Twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs2302489 in CD94; rs2255336, rs2617160, rs7980470, rs 2734565, and rs17513986 in NKG2D; rs2617170, rs17549004, and rs3825295 in NKG2F; rs2734414, rs7301582, and rs2734440 in NKG2A, were selected in the present study. SNP genotyping was undertaken in 500 Han Chinese patients (285 patients with chronic hepatitis B and 215 patients who cleared HBV spontaneously) by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and by the TaqMan method. Single marker association analysis was conducted and the SNP rs2617160 with a TT genotype in NKG2D was associated significantly with an increased risk of chronic hepatitis B (P = 0.044; OR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.01-2.19). Haplotype analysis with multiple loci indicated that there was no significant association between the haplotypes of the NKR genes and susceptibility to chronic hepatitis B. The SNP rs2617160 in NKG2D associated with susceptibility to chronic hepatitis B in a Han Chinese population."
20576952,20576952,Minor allele C of chromosome 1p32 single nucleotide polymorphism rs11206510 confers risk of ischemic stroke in the Chinese Han population.,"Genome-wide association studies found that the common allele T of single nucleotide polymorphism rs11206510 on chromosome 1p32 was associated with increased low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels (LDL-C) and with risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in white populations. The goals of this study are to determine whether rs11206510 is associated with LDL-C and CAD in a different ethnic population, namely a Chinese cohort, and to investigate whether rs11206510 is associated with ischemic stroke."

20565998,20565998,Selenoprotein P gene r25191g/a polymorphism and quantification of selenoprotein P mRNA level in patients with Kashin-Beck disease.,"Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) is an endemic and deformable osteoarthrosis. Epidemiological study has revealed that lower Se level is the principal environmental factor in the pathogenesis of KBD. Selenoprotein P (SEPP1) is a special selenoprotein, which is the primary form of Se in vivo. Our aim was to investigate the putative association of SEPP1 r25191g/a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with KBD risk and the SEPP1 transcriptional levels in whole blood and articular cartilage tissue of KBD cases and controls, respectively. One hundred and sixty-seven cases with KBD and 166 control subjects from Shaanxi province of China were included in the present study. The detection of SNP r25191g/a in the 3' untranslated region was performed using an efficient technique, tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system PCR. A quantitative analysis of SEPP1 mRNA in KBD and control groups by real-time PCR was also performed. The present results show no significant difference in genotype and allele distribution of SNP r25191g/a between individuals with KBD and controls (P = 0·279 and 0·428, respectively). There was also no association between SNP r25191g/a and risk of KBD (OR 1·153; 95 % CI 0·533, 2·496). However, the frequency of the rare genotype AG of SNP r25191g/a was significantly lower in Chinese population than in the Caucasians. It was shown that the SEPP1 mRNA expression in whole blood was lower in KBD patients than in the control group (0·149-fold, P < 0·001), but that it was much higher in articular cartilage tissue (4·53-fold, P = 0·012). Our aim was to lay a foundation for us to further study the association between the pathogenesis of KBD and SEPP1."
20571505,20571505,A single nucleotide polymorphism in APOA5 determines triglyceride levels in Hong Kong and Guangzhou Chinese.,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5) gene have been associated with hypertriglyceridaemia. We investigated which SNPs in the APOA5 gene were associated with triglyceride levels in two independent Chinese populations. In all, 1375 subjects in the Hong Kong Cardiovascular Risk Factor Prevalence Study were genotyped for five tagging SNPs chosen from HapMap. Replication was sought in 1996 subjects from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. Among the five SNPs, rs662799 (-1131T>C) was strongly related to log-transformed triglyceride levels among Hong Kong subjects (β=0.192, P=2.6 × 10(-13)). Plasma triglyceride level was 36.1% higher in CC compared to TT genotype. This association was confirmed in Guangzhou subjects (β=0.159, P=1.3 × 10(-12)), and was significantly irrespective of sex, age group, obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, diabetes, smoking and alcohol drinking. The odds ratios and 95% confidence interval for plasma triglycerides ≥1.7 mmol/l associated with TC and CC genotypes were, respectively, 1.81 (1.37-2.39) and 2.22 (1.44-3.43) in Hong Kong and 1.27 (1.05-1.54) and 1.97 (1.42-2.73) in Guangzhou. Haplotype analysis suggested the association was due to rs662799 only. The corroborative findings in two independent populations indicate that the APOA5-1131T>C polymorphism is an important and clinically relevant determinant of plasma triglyceride levels in the Chinese population."
20559012,20559012,"Polyunsaturated fatty acids, DNA repair single nucleotide polymorphisms and colorectal cancer in the Singapore Chinese Health Study.","Animal and in vitrostudies support a role for polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in colon carcinogenesis; however, the epidemiological evidence is inconclusive. Recently, we investigated their role within the Singapore Chinese Health Study, a population-based cohort of Singapore Chinese men and women. We reported that a high intake of marine n-3 PUFAs was associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Oxidation of PUFAs incorporated into cell membranes generates lipid hydroperoxides, which can be mutagenic. In this report, we investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA repair genes modified the effect of PUFAs on CRC risk using a nested case-control study within the Singapore Chinese Health Study. We genotyped 1,181 controls and 311 cases (180 colon and 131 rectal cancer) for SNPs in the XRCC1 (Arg194Trp, Arg399Gln), OGG1 (Ser326Cys), PARP (Val762Ala, Lys940Arg), and XPD (Asp312Asn, Lys751Gln) genes. We observed that the PARP Val762Ala SNP modified the association between marine n-3 PUFA and rectal cancer risk, with no evidence of interaction among colon cancer (heterogeneity test p=0.003). Our results suggest a positive association between high intake of marine n-3 PUFA and rectal cancer risk among carriers of at least one PARP codon 762 Ala allele (odds ratio=1.7, 95% confidence interval=1.1-2.7)."
20554015,20554015,No significant association between RELN polymorphism and autism in case-control and family-based association study in Chinese Han population.,"The present study genotyped four SNPs (rs736707, rs2229864, rs362691, and rs2073559) of the Reelin gene (RELN) in 165 autistic trios, 67 sporadic autistic children and 283 healthy controls with Chinese Han pedigree. Both case-control analysis and transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) found no evidence of significant association. The results do not support previous positive findings and suggest that the four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of RELN are unlikely to be associated with childhood autism in Chinese Han population."

In mesencephalic dopamine neuron culture, the majority of isolated dopamine neurons express VGLUT2, but not VGLUT1 or 3, have been demonstrated. As related to the dysregulated glutamatergic hypothesis of schizophrenia, the gene encoding VGLUT2 is the most plausible candidate involved in the pathogenesis of this illness."
20550665,20550665,Association study of genetic variants in eight genes/loci with type 2 diabetes in a Han Chinese population.,"At least twenty genes/loci were shown to be associated with type 2diabetes in European original populations. Five of these genes were shown to be associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Chinese populations. The purpose of this study was to replicate the association of genetic vairants in the eight diabetes-related genes/loci with type 2 diabetes in a Han Chinese cohort from western part of China. Nineteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the eight genes/loci including TCF7L2, HHEX, CDKAL1, SLC30A8, PPARG, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, and CDKN2A/CDKN2B were genotyped in 1,529 cases and 1,439 controls in a Han Chinese population using the ABI SNaPshot method. The meta-analysis of the association between rs7903146 in TCF7L2 gene and T2D in the Han Chinese was performed."

20585626,20585626,Identification of a functional genetic variant at 16q12.1 for breast cancer risk: results from the Asia Breast Cancer Consortium.,"Genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of breast cancer. We carried out a multi-stage genome-wide association (GWA) study in over 28,000 cases and controls recruited from 12 studies conducted in Asian and European American women to identify genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer. After analyzing 684,457 SNPs in 2,073 cases and 2,084 controls in Chinese women, we evaluated 53 SNPs for fast-track replication in an independent set of 4,425 cases and 1,915 controls of Chinese origin. Four replicated SNPs were further investigated in an independent set of 6,173 cases and 6,340 controls from seven other studies conducted in Asian women. SNP rs4784227 was consistently associated with breast cancer risk across all studies with adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 1.25 (1.20-1.31) per allele (P = 3.2 x 10(-25)) in the pooled analysis of samples from all Asian samples. This SNP was also associated with breast cancer risk among European Americans (per allele OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.09-1.31, P = 1.3 x 10(-4), 2,797 cases and 2,662 controls). SNP rs4784227 is located at 16q12.1, a region identified previously for breast cancer risk among Europeans. The association of this SNP with breast cancer risk remained highly statistically significant in Asians after adjusting for previously-reported SNPs in this region. In vitro experiments using both luciferase reporter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated functional significance of this SNP. These results provide strong evidence implicating rs4784227 as a functional causal variant for breast cancer in the locus 16q12.1 and demonstrate the utility of conducting genetic association studies in populations with different genetic architectures."

20558149,20558149,Complement receptor 1 polymorphisms and risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.,"The amyloid beta-protein (Abeta)-induced complement system activation plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Complement receptor 1 (CR1) is thought to contribute to Abeta clearance. A recent large genome-wide association study (GWAS) has identified significant association of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs6656401 and rs3818361) in the CR1 gene with AD in Caucasians. Here, we performed a case-control study to clarify whether the risk for sporadic late-onset AD (LOAD) might be influenced by these polymorphisms in a large Chinese cohort consisting of 254 patients and 357 healthy controls. The results revealed that there were significant differences in genotype (P=0.02) and allele (P=0.007) frequencies of the SNP rs6656401 but no in rs3818361 between AD patients and controls. The A allele of rs6656401 was associated with an increased risk of LOAD (P=0.007, odds ratios/OR =1.652). In the subgroup of APOE epsilon4 non-carriers, both the A of rs6656401 and T allele of rs3818361 were observed to be significantly higher in case than in controls (P=0.002 and P=0.035, respectively). For rs6656401, the logistic regression analysis revealed that the (AA +AG) genotypes has a 2.4-fold increased risk compared with the GG genotype (P=0.049). Haplotype analysis identified the AT haplotype to increase the risk of LOAD (P=0.03, OR=2.44). This study provides the evidence that variations in the CR1 gene play an important role in the pathogenesis of sporadic LOAD in the Han Chinese population."

Five novel susceptibility genes (TNIP1, SLC15A4, ETS1, RasGRP3 and IKZF1) for SLE have been identified in a recent genome-wide association study of a Chinese Han population. This study investigated their relationships with disease subphenotypes, including renal nephritis, photosensitivity, antinuclear antibody (ANA), age at diagnosis, malar rash, discoid rash, immunological disorder, oral ulcer, hematological disorder, neurological disorder, serositis, arthritis and vasculitis. Significant associations were found for the single nucleotide polymorphism rs10036748 of TNIP1 with photosensitivity (odds ratio (OR) = 0.87, p = 0.01) and vasculitis (OR = 1.18, p = 0.04); rs10847697 of SLC15A4 with discoid rash (OR = 1.18, p = 0.02); rs6590330 of ETS1 with SLE of age at diagnosis <20 years (OR = 1.24, p = 8.91 x 10(-5)); rs13385731 of RasGRP3 with malar rash (OR = 1.20, p = 0.01), discoid rash (OR = 0.78, p = 0.02) and ANA (OR = 0.72, p = 0.004); rs4917014 of IKZF1 with renal nephritis (OR = 1.13, p = 0.02) and malar rash (OR = 0.83, p = 0.00038), respectively. The study suggested that these susceptibility genes might not only play important roles in the development of SLE, but also contribute to the complex phenotypes of SLE."

20505679,20505679,SPP1 promoter polymorphisms and glioma risk in a Chinese Han population.,"SPP1 was found to be significantly upregulated in many kinds of malignant tumors, including gliomas. Considering that gene polymorphisms have been implicated in the development of gliomas, we performed an association study between SPP1 functional promoter region polymorphisms and glioma risk in a Chinese population. We found significant evidence of an association between SPP1 promoter polymorphisms and glioma risk. For the -155_156insG variant, the -155_156GG allele was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of glioma (P=0.020, odds ratio (OR)=1.202, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.028-1.408). Individuals with the genotype containing the GG allele had a 1.372-fold increased risk (P=0.006, OR=1.372, 95% CI: 1.095-1.719). Further stratified analyses suggested that a significant association existed in adult glioma patients, male subjects and in cases without a family history of cancer. Alternatively, the study of single-nucleotide polymorphism -443C/T in a recessive model revealed that the genotype CC+CT significantly decreased the risk of glioma when compared with TT (P=0.023, OR=0.774, 95% CI: 0.621-0.966). After the analysis of haplotypes, the haplotype -155_156GG/-443T was represented at a significantly higher frequency in cases (P=0.029, OR=1.192, 95% CI: 1.018-1.395). Cellular assay indicated that the transcriptional activity of the SPP1 promoter containing the -155_156GG allele significantly increased in glioma cells. Thus, variants of the SPP1 promoter might influence the risk of glioma by regulating promoter activity. Further analyses are necessary to validate our observation in larger samples or in other ethnic groups."
20513365,20513365,SNP rs7684318 of the alpha-synuclein gene is associated with Parkinson's disease in the Han Chinese population.,"Mutations in the alpha-synuclein (SNCA) gene have been shown to be responsible for a rare familial form of Parkinson's disease (PD). Furthermore, polymorphic variants in multiple regions of the gene have been associated with susceptibility to idiopathic PD in different populations. Previous studies in Japanese have found a strong association between idiopathic PD and the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7684318, which is located within an intron of the SNCA gene. Our aim was to verify these findings and to further explore the nature of the association in a subset of Han Chinese PD patients. A case-control study of the SNP rs7684318, comprising 332 PD patients and 300 healthy controls, was carried out in Han Chinese populations from two centers in mainland China. The rs7684318 polymorphism was determined by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. The SNP rs7684318 of the SNCA gene showed a strong association with PD (P<0.01). Among our PD patients, mean age at disease onset and gender did not differ significantly between rs7684318 carriers and non-carriers. Our findings suggested that the SNP rs7684318 (T>C) transition of the SNCA gene contributes to PD susceptibility in Chinese Han population, which is consistent with the earlier study form Japan."
20497632,20497632,Association of TLR9 gene polymorphisms with lupus nephritis in a Chinese Han population.,"Although increasing data have supported the possible role of TLR-9 in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis (LN), the effect of TLR-9 on the lupus phenotype remains controversial. The aim of this study was to associate common variants in the TLR9 gene with susceptibility to lupus nephritis in the Chinese population to further ascertain whether it is a susceptible locus for SLE, especially its likely role in LN from a comparatively large population."
20500698,20500698,Analysis of functional SNP in ifng/ifngr1 in Chinese Han population with tuberculosis.,"Ifng/Ifngr1 are the main genes that are associated with tuberculosis. We continued to search for other functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and investigated their influence on patients with tuberculosis in the Chinese population. Seven SNP located in the ifng and ifngr1 genes were genotyped by ligase detection reaction in 222 cases and 188 ethnically matched controls. A significant genetic association between rs7749390 (located on the exon/intron splice site of the ifngr1 gene) and tuberculosis was observed, and the log-additive model was accepted as the best inheritance model to fit these data (OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.02-1.80, P = 0.038). Haplotype-specific association analysis revealed that the result was consistent with the individual SNP study. The combination of rs2234711/rs1327474/rs7749390/rs41401746, which was in strong linkage disequilibrium (D' > 0.75), showed a significant association of ifngr1 with tuberculosis (P = 0.00079). Neither the single SNP nor the haplotype analysis showed a significant association between tuberculosis and the ifng gene markers. Our data implied the involvement of the ifngr1 gene in susceptibility to tuberculosis."

20483479,20483479,Analysis of association between the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene and negative symptoms in chronic schizophrenia.,"Negative symptoms commonly seen in chronic schizophrenia are related to prefrontal hypodopaminergia. Dysfunction of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene has long been thought to confer susceptibility to schizophrenia because of its catalytic activity for dopamine degradation. The present study is an attempt to perform a quantitative trait test for genetic association between the COMT gene and negative symptoms in a Chinese population. A total of 290 unrelated individuals with schizophrenia patients were recruited and their symptoms were assessed through the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The quantitative trait test was performed by the UNPHASED programme to examine the correlation between the scored negative symptoms and the coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present in the COMT gene. The rs4633-rs4680 haplotype showed significant association with the overall score of negative symptoms, and four individual negative symptoms, including blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport and passive/apathetic social withdrawal. SNP rs4680 (Val/Met) showed significant association with blunted affect. The present finding suggests that the COMT gene may a etiologically contribute to the severity of negative symptoms in schizophrenia, but its precise mechanism needs further investigating."
20477789,20477789,"Porcine NAMPT gene: search for polymorphism, mapping and association studies.","NAMPT encodes an enzyme catalysing the rate-limiting step in NAD biosynthesis. The extracellular form of the enzyme is known as adipokine visfatin. We detected SNP AM999341:g.669T>C (referred to as 669T>C) in intron 9 and SNP FN392209:g.358A>G (referred to as 358A>G) in the promoter of the gene. RH mapping linked the gene to microsatellite SW944. Linkage analysis placed the gene on the current USDA – USMARC linkage map at position 92 cM on SSC9. Association analyses were performed in a wild boar × Meishan F2 family (W × M), with 45 traits recorded (growth and fattening, fat deposition, muscling, meat quality, stress resistance and other traits), and in a commercial Landrace × Chinese-European (LCE) synthetic population with records for 15 traits (growth, fat deposition, muscling, intramuscular fat, meat colour and backfat fatty acid content). In the W × M, SNP 669T>C was associated with muscling, fat deposition, growth and fattening, meat quality and other traits and in the LCE with muscling, meat quality and backfat fatty acid composition. In the W × M, SNP 358A>G was associated with muscling, fat deposition, growth and other traits. After correction for multiple testing, the NAMPT haplotypes were associated in the W × M with, in descending order, muscling (q = 0.0056), growth (q = 0.0056), fat deposition (q = 0.0109), fat-to-meat ratio (q = 0.0135), cooling losses (q = 0.0568) and longissimus pHU (q = 0.0695). The SNPs are hypothesized to be in linkage disequilibrium with a causative mutation affecting energy metabolism as a whole rather than fat metabolism alone."
20477842,20477842,Failure to detect association between polymorphisms of the sodium channel gene SCN1A and febrile seizures in Chinese patients with epilepsy.,"Arecent study in Caucasians found an association between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of SCN1A, IVS5N +5 G>A (rs3812718), and febrile seizures (FS). We examined whether this and other tagging SNPs of SCN1A were associated with an increased risk of FS in Han Chinese. A total of 728 Han Chinese patients with focal epilepsy were recruited: 97 had a history of FS (58% male, mean age 35 ± 12 years) and 631 did not (50% male, mean age 40 ± 15 years). Genotyping was performed for IVS5N +5 G>A and seven other tagging SNPs selected from the HapMap database. Genotyping was also performed in 848 ethnically matched population controls (50% male, mean age 37 ± 17 years). There was no statistically significant difference in either allele or genotype frequency of any of the SNPs studied between epilepsy patients with and without FS, and between epilepsy patients with FS and controls. The results do not suggest that SCN1A SNPs are susceptibility factors for FS in Han Chinese."
20487573,20487573,Association between EGF +61 G/A and glioma risk in a Chinese population.,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is critical in cancer process. EGF and EGF receptor (EGFR) interaction plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and tumorigenesis of epithelial tissues. Variations of the EGF +61G/A (rs4444903) may lead to an alteration in EGF production and/or activity, which can result in individual susceptibility to brain glioma. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential association between EGF +61G/A and brain glioma in a Chinese population."
20478361,20478361,Lack of replication of a previously reported association between polymorphism in the 3'UTR of the alpha-synuclein gene and Parkinson's disease in Chinese subjects.,"Recent studies have implicated polymorphisms in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the alpha-synuclein (SNCA) gene in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs356165 is one of polymorphisms located in the 3'UTR and its association with PD has been reported but remains controversial. Herein, we conducted a case-control study to further evaluate the possible association between SNP rs356165 and PD in Chinese. All subjects (330 PD patients and 300 normal controls) were successfully genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. No statistically significant difference in genotype frequency between cases and controls was observed (P=0.863), suggesting no association of SNP rs356165 with PD in our population. Thus, it may be premature to conclude an association between the 3'UTR of the SNCA gene and PD, and this association should be further examined in different ethnic populations."
20477798,20477798,Mapping QTL in the porcine MHC region affecting fatness and growth traits in a Meishan/Large White composite population.,"A number of studies have mapped QTL regulating porcine fatness and growth traits to the region of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on porcine chromosome 7 using various experimental crosses. The QTL results from crosses using the Chinese Meishan (MS) (slow growing and fat) are particularly interesting because the MS alleles have been found to be associated with increased growth rate and reduced backfat depth. We investigated these QTL further in a composite population derived previously over eight generations by intercrossing Meishan and the European Large White breeds. Genotype information from 32 markers in a 15cM target region was used in linkage and association analyses. A two-step variance component analysis identified QTL for three growth-related traits, explaining 19 ∼ 24% of the phenotypic variance with a confidence interval of 4 cM in the target region. SNP association analyses found that ss181128966 and ss181128924 within the QTL interval were strongly associated with the growth traits. Only weak signals for an effect on backfat depth were found in the association and linkage analyses, possibly because of past directional selection in the composite population."
20462940,20462940,A variant in the CHEK2 promoter at a methylation site relieves transcriptional repression and confers reduced risk of lung cancer.,"Checkpoint kinase (CHEK) 2, a tumor suppressor gene, plays an essential role in the DNA damage checkpoint response cascade. We first investigated two polymorphisms in the proximal promoter of the CHEK2 gene and evaluated their associations with the risk of lung cancer in a case-control study using 500 incident lung cancer cases and 517 cancer-free controls. We found that CHEK2 rs2236141 -48 G > A was significantly associated with lung cancer risk (P = 0.0018). Similar results were obtained in a follow-up replication study in 575 lung cancer patients and 589 controls (P = 0.042). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that individuals with the G allele had lower levels of CHEK2 transcripts in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and normal lung tissues. The -48 G-->A variant eliminated a methylation site and thereby relieve the transcriptional repression of CHEK2. Therefore, this polymorphism affected downstream transcription through genetic and epigenetic modifications. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that the major G allele significantly attenuated reporter gene expression when methylated. Electrophoretic Mobility shift assays and surface plasmon resonance revealed that the methylated G allele increased transcription factor accessibility. We used in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation to confirm that the relevant transcription factor was Sp1. Using lung tissue heterozygous for the G/A single-nucleotide polymorphism, we found that Sp1 acted as a repressor and had a stronger binding affinity for the G allele. These results support our hypothesis that the CHEK2 rs2236141 variant modifies lung cancer susceptibility in the Chinese population by affecting CHEK2 expression."
20427016,20427016,Single nucleotide polymorphism rs1333049 on chromosome 9p21.3 is associated with Alzheimer's disease in Han Chinese.,"Chromosome 9p21.3 polymorphism has been shown to affect susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Caucasians, while there are no studies on the association of chromosome 9p21.3 polymorphism with the risk of AD in Asians."
20473689,20473689,Polymorphisms in the GNB3 and ADD1 genes and blood pressure in a Chinese population.,"A large proportion of the phenotypic variation in blood pressure (BP) appears to be inherited as a polygenic trait. This study examined the association between 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the guanine nucleotide binding protein beta polypeptide 3 (GNB3) and adducin 1 alpha (ADD1) genes and systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), and mean arterial (MAP) BP. A total of 3,142 individuals from 636 families were recruited from rural north China, and 2,746 met the eligibility criteria for analysis. BP measurements were obtained using a random-zero sphygmomanometer. Genetic variants were determined using SNPlex assays on an automated DNA Sequencer. A mixed linear model was used to estimate the association between each SNP and BP level. After Bonferroni correction, marker rs4963516 of the GNB3 gene remained significantly associated with DBP (corrected P values = 0.006, 0.007 and 0.002 for co-dominant, additive, and recessive models, respectively) and MAP (corrected P values = 0.02, 0.049, and 0.005, respectively). Compared to carriers of the major A allele, CC homozygotes had higher mean DBP (75.81 +/- 0.62 vs. 73.46 +/- 0.25 mmHg, P = 0.0002) and MAP (91.87 +/- 0.68 vs. 89.42 +/- 0.28 mmHg, P = 0.0004) after adjusting for covariates of age, gender, BMI, study site, and room temperature during BP measurement. In summary, these data support a role for the GNB3 gene in BP regulation in the Chinese population. Future studies aimed at replicating these novel findings are warranted."
20438790,20438790,STAT4 polymorphism in a Chinese Han population with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome and Behçet's disease.,"This study investigated the association of rs7574865 polymorphism in STAT4 with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome and Behçet's disease (BD) in a Chinese Han population. Genotyping of rs7574865 polymorphism in the STAT4 gene was performed using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphisms in 379 VKH patients, 366 BD patients, and 414 controls. Of the samples, 20% were sequenced to validate polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism results. A binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess the influence of the gender on the association of STAT4 polymorphism with BD. A significantly increased frequency of TT genotype of the STAT4 rs7574865 was observed in VKH patients (p = 0.013). GT genotypic frequency was significantly lower in BD patients than in controls (p = 0.003) However the significance of rs7574865 was lost in all tested BD patients when adjusted for gender (p = 0.775). A significantly lower frequency of GT genotype and a significantly higher frequency of GG genotype was found in male BD patients compared with male controls (p = 0.000458 and p = 0.009, respectively). Stratification analysis according to tinnitus, alopecia, poliosis, headache, and vitiligo for VKH syndrome and oral ulceration, genital ulceration, skin lesions and arthritis for BD failed to find any association between the tested single nucleotide polymorphism and any of the extraocular findings. Our results suggest that TT genotype of rs7574865 may be a susceptible factor for VKH syndrome in a Chinese Han population, and that GG genotype of this SNP may confer susceptibility in male BD patients."
20386566,20386566,Genome-wide association study of bipolar I disorder in the Han Chinese population.,"We report the first genome-wide association study in 1000 bipolar I patients and 1000 controls, with a replication of the top hits in another 409 cases and 1000 controls in the Han Chinese population. Four regions with most strongly associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, of which three were not found in previous GWA studies in the Caucasian populations. Among them, SNPs close to specificity protein 8 (SP8) and ST8 α-N-acetyl- neuraminide α-2,8-sialyltransferase (ST8SIA2) are associated with Bipolar I, with P-values of 4.87 × 10(-7) (rs2709736) and 6.05 × 10(-6) (rs8040009), respectively. We have also identified SNPs in potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 12 gene (KCTD12) (rs2073831, P=9.74 × 10(-6)) and in CACNB2 (Calcium channel, voltage-dependent, β-2 subunit) gene (rs11013860, P=5.15 × 10(-5)), One SNP nearby the rs1938526 SNP of ANK3 gene and another SNP nearby the SNP rs11720452 in chromosome 3 reported in previous GWA studies also showed suggestive association in this study (P=6.55 × 10(-5) and P=1.48 × 10(-5), respectively). This may suggest that there are common and population-specific susceptibility genes for bipolar I disorder."
20414142,20414142,Association study between RGS4 and bipolar disorder in the Chinese Han population.,"This abstract concerns a brief association study between RGS4 and bipolar disorder, by an association study of five single nucleotide polymorphisms, rs951436, rs951439, rs2842030, rs2661319, and rs2344671, in 484 patients and 288 controls from the Chinese Han population. In our case-control study, the T allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism rs951436 tended to be protective (P=0.0078), and in addition, a haplotype containing this T allele was also protective for bipolar disorder (P=0.02). Our results provide further evidence to support RGS4 as a potential susceptible gene for bipolar disorder."
20378355,20378355,Is there an association of regulatory region polymorphism in the alpha-1-antichymotrypsin gene with sporadic Alzheimer's disease in the northern Han-Chinese population?,"Both invitro and invivo alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) directly inhibits amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) degradation and promotes Abeta deposition. However, whether the genetic variants in the regulatory region (including the promoter and the two enhancers) of the ACT gene affect susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains controversial. Here, we screened ACT promoter and enhancers in 244 patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD) and 205 control patients, both of north Han-Chinese origin. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were found: (i) 11510T/C (rs10145747, named as ACT1); 11496G/A (rs4375593, ACT2); (iii) 11491T/C (rs4508366, ACT3); and (iv) 51G/T (rs1884082, ACT4). Neither individual SNP nor haplotypes were associated with AD onset. We concluded that the effect of the variations in the ACT regulatory region must be very limited, if occurring at all."
20459637,20459637,Evaluating the transferability of Hapmap SNPs to a Singapore Chinese population.,"The International Hapmap project serves as a valuable resource for human genome variation data, however its applicability to other populations has yet to be exhaustively investigated. In this paper, we use high density genotyping chips and resequencing strategies to compare the Singapore Chinese population with the Hapmap populations. First we compared 1028 and 114 unrelated Singapore Chinese samples genotyped using the Illumina Human Hapmap 550 k chip and Affymetrix 500 k array respectively against the 270 samples from Hapmap. Secondly, data from 20 candidate genes on 5q31-33 resequenced for an asthma candidate gene based study was also used for the analysis."
20402822,20402822,Single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes of TLR6 gene in Chinese Cantonese population.,"Sequence polymorphisms in the coding region of Toll-like receptor 6 gene were investigated in Chinese Cantonese population. By amplifying and sequencing a 2787 bp segment containing the entire coding region of TLR6 gene of 191 individuals in Chinese Cantonese population, a total of seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) along with their frequencies were detected. Comparing these data with SNP published in dbSNP database of National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), two SNP (+176T/C and +1408G/T) were firstly reported, and five SNP caused amino-acid substitution. Sixteen haplotypes and their distributions were reconstructed. Linkage disequilibrium analysis and neutrality test were also performed. Comparing with other ethnic populations, Chinese Cantonese displayed obvious differences in TLR6 polymorphism. It may in part reflect the ethnic diversity of pathogen susceptibility and facilitate to develop the disease-association studies as well as population genetics and evolutionary research."
20379887,20379887,"Evaluation of the IGFs (IGF1 and IGF2) genes as candidates for growth, body measurement, carcass, and reproduction traits in Beijing You and Silkie chickens.","Insulin-like growth factors are crucial in cellular growth, differentiation, and reproduction by mediating many of the actions of growth hormone in chickens. To determine whether insulin-like growth factors genes (IGFs) are associated with important economic traits in chicken or not, we herein analyzed the association between two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within IGF1 and IGF2 and twenty-seven growth, body measurement, carcass, and reproduction traits in two Chinese native breeds, i.e., Beijing You and Silkies. With marker-trait association analysis, we found that SNP IGF1-PstI, within the 5' flanking region of IGF1, was significantly associated with body weight at 8 (BW8), 10 (BW10), and 13 (BW13) wk of age; and shank length (SL13) and shank circumference (SC13) at 13 wk of age in Silkie population (P < 0.05). The SNP IGF2-MspI within the exon2 of IGF2 showed a significant association with body weight (BW17) and carcass weight (CW17) at 17 wk of age in Beijing You population (P < 0.05). Our findings implied that the SNPs within IGF1 and IGF2 genes could be in linkage disequilibrium with the actual causative mutations that affect growth and carcass traits."

20352181,20352181,A single-nucleotide polymorphism that accounts for allelic variation in the Lr34 gene and leaf rust reaction in hard winter wheat.,"Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks, is one of the most common and persistent wheat diseases in the US Great Plains. We report that the Lr34 gene was mapped in the center of a QTL for leaf rust reaction and explained 18-35% of the total phenotypic variation in disease severity of adult plants in a Jagger x 2174 population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) field-tested for 3 years. The sequence of the complete Lr34 gene was determined for the susceptible Jagger allele and for the resistant 2174 allele. The two alleles had exactly the same sequence as the resistant allele reported previously in Chinese Spring at three polymorphic sites in intron 4, exon 11, and exon 12. A G/T polymorphism was found in exon 22, where a premature stop codon was found in the susceptible Jagger allele (Lr34E22s), confirming a previous report, due to a point mutation compared with the resistant 2174 allele (Lr34E22r). We have experimentally demonstrated a tight association between the point mutation at exon 22 of Lr34 and leaf rust susceptibility in a segregating biparental population. A PCR marker was developed to distinguish between the Lr34E22r and Lr34E22s alleles. A survey of 33 local hard winter wheat cultivars indicated that 7 cultivars carry the Lr34E22s allele and 26 cultivars carry the Lr34E22r allele. This study significantly improves our genetic understanding of allelic variation in the Lr34 gene and provides a functional molecular tool to improve leaf rust resistance in a major US wheat gene pool."
20364331,20364331,The association of CLOCK gene T3111C polymorphism and hPER3 gene 54-nucleotide repeat polymorphism with Chinese Han people schizophrenics.,"Many reports have shown that the biologic rhythm could be altered due to mutations of circadian gene hClock or hPeriod, and the mutations of circadian genes have some relationship with psychosis according to recent studies. A preliminary study has been conducted to examine wether the T3111C single nucleotide polymorphism of the hClock gene or the length polymorphism of the hPer3 gene is associated with the development of schizophrenia. The samples from schizophrenics (n=148, male: 57.4%, female: 42.6%) and normal controls (n=199, male: 59.3%, female: 40.7%) were examined. Allele frequencies of T3111C SNP of hClock were significantly different between schizophrenics and controls (χ2=19.738, P<0.05). Schizophrenics had a significantly higher frequency of the C allele compared with controls (OR=2.613, 95% CI=1.693-4.034). On the other hand, there is no significant difference of allele frequencies of 18 exon of hper3 between schizophrenics and controls (χ2=0.192, P>0.05). Our results suggest that the T3111C (RS1801260) polymorphism of hClock gene is associated with schizophrenia, but it seems that the length polymorphism of 18 exon of hPer3 may not be associated with schizophrenia. It is important to address of the relationship between circadian gene polymorphisms and dopamine functions in further study."

Recently, genetic polymorphisms within the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) genes have been reported to be associated with RA. To analyze the association between the genetic polymorphisms within TLR4 gene and the susceptibility to RA in Chinese people, two functional variants, Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile, in the TLR4 gene were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and direct sequencing techniques from 213 RA patients and 247 ethnically matched controls. None polymorphisms of Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile were detected in all RA cases and controls, which indicates that there is no relevance between these two SNPs and RA in the Chinese Han population.

20352109,20352109,Association of the CTLA4 gene with Graves' disease in the Chinese Han population.,"To determine whether genetic heterogeneity exists in patients with Graves' disease (GD), the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated 4 (CTLA-4) gene, which is implicated a susceptibility gene for GD by considerable genetic and immunological evidence, was used for association analysis in a Chinese Han cohort recruited from various geographic regions. Our association study for the SNPs in the CTLA4 gene in 2640 GD patients and 2204 control subjects confirmed that CTLA4 is the susceptibility gene for GD in the Chinese Han population. Moreover, the logistic regression analysis in the combined Chinese Han cohort revealed that SNP rs231779 (allele frequencies p = 2.81x10(-9), OR = 1.35, and genotype distributions p = 2.75x10(-9), OR = 1.42) is likely the susceptibility variant for GD. Interestingly, the logistic regression analysis revealed that SNP rs35219727 may be the susceptibility variant to GD in the Shandong population; however, SNP, rs231779 in the CTLA4 gene probably independently confers GD susceptibility in the Xuzhou and southern China populations. These data suggest that the susceptibility variants of the CTLA4 gene varied between the different geographic populations with GD."

20237851,20237851,"Molecular characterization, polymorphism of bovine ZBTB38 gene and association with body measurement traits in native Chinese cattle breeds.","Zinc finger and BTB domain containing 38 (ZBTB38), binding to and repressing methylated DNA, is an important candidate gene for selection of body measurement traits through marker-assisted selection (MAS). The expression of ZBTB38 is regulated in human and animal height as well as other stature indexes. Genomic structural analysis shows that bovine ZBTB38 shares much similarity with human ZBTB38. We discovered and evaluated the potential association of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the bovine ZBTB38 gene with body measurement traits in 722 individuals. The latest findings demonstrate that the A841G SNP in exon 1 is significantly associated with Body Length (BL), Hip Height (HH) and Heart Girth (HG). Furthermore, the analysis of A841G SNP marker shows that there are significant effects on the BL (P = 0.0389) in 722 individuals, significant effects on the HH (P = 0.0173) and HG (P = 0.0147) in Qinchuan improvement steers (QI) population, as well as significant effects on the WH (P = 0.0094) in Xuelong (XL) population. These results clearly suggest that the ZBTB38 gene is among of target genes for body measurement traits in bovine reproduction and breeding, and thus provide data for establishment of an animal model using cattle to study big animal body type."

20234319,20234319,Association of the CHRNA3 locus with lung cancer risk and prognosis in Chinese Han population.,"Recent genome-wide association studies in Caucasians revealed association with lung cancer risk of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the locus containing two nicotine acetylcholine receptor CHRNA genes. However, the reported risk SNPs are extremely rare in Asians. This study sought to identify other variants on CHRNA3 associated with lung cancer susceptibility and to explore whether SNPs of CHRNA3 are of prognostic factors in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Chinese Han population."
20230296,20230296,Absence of association between CD86 +1057G/A polymorphism and coronary artery disease.,"CD86, one of the key costimulatory molecules, is not only involved in the initiation of T-cell immunity but also plays important roles in the development of cardiovascular diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between the CD86 polymorphism and the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in a Chinese population. We analyzed single-nucleotide polymorphism of CD86 +1057G/A (rs1129055) in 164 patients with CAD and 299 healthy controls by performing polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing assay. No significant association was observed in the genotype and allele frequencies of +1057G/A polymorphism between cases and controls, indicating that CD86 +1057G/A polymorphism may not be associated with CAD in the Chinese population."

20201430,20201430,Polyacrylamide gel-based microarray: a novel method applied to the association Study between the polymorphisms of BDNF gene and autism.,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are important markers which can be used in the association study for searching for associated genes of complex diseases. High-throughput methods in a large number of samples are needed for SNP genotyping. In this study, we applied polyacrylamide gel-based microarray combined with universal dual-color hybridization for trios-based associative study of BDNF polymorphisms with autism in Chinese. All four SNPs in both patients and their parents could be analyzed quickly and correctly. In single SNP TDT analysis, C270T showed preferential transmission of the T allele compared to the C allele (TDT p < 0.001) in autism. In haplotype TDT analysis, C270T polymorphism also existed in the haplotype combination which showed significant association (TDT p < 0.05). These results suggest a potential association between BDNF and autism in the Chinese population. The study also show that the polyacrylamide gel-based microarray combined with universal dual-color detectors is a rapid, simple, high-throughput method for SNPs genotyping, and can be very effective and cost effective in association study of susceptible gene with disorders in large samples."
20221248,20221248,Association of the OCA2 polymorphism His615Arg with melanin content in east Asian populations: further evidence of convergent evolution of skin pigmentation.,"The last decade has witnessed important advances in our understanding of the genetics of pigmentation in European populations, but very little is known about the genes involved in skin pigmentation variation in East Asian populations. Here, we present the results of a study evaluating the association of 10 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) located within 5 pigmentation candidate genes (OCA2, DCT, ADAM17, ADAMTS20, and TYRP1) with skin pigmentation measured quantitatively in a sample of individuals of East Asian ancestry living in Canada. We show that the non-synonymous polymorphism rs1800414 (His615Arg) located within the OCA2 gene is significantly associated with skin pigmentation in this sample. We replicated this result in an independent sample of Chinese individuals of Han ancestry. This polymorphism is characterized by a derived allele that is present at a high frequency in East Asian populations, but is absent in other population groups. In both samples, individuals with the derived G allele, which codes for the amino acid arginine, show lower melanin levels than those with the ancestral A allele, which codes for the amino acid histidine. An analysis of this non-synonymous polymorphism using several programs to predict potential functional effects provides additional support for the role of this SNP in skin pigmentation variation in East Asian populations. Our results are consistent with previous research indicating that evolution to lightly-pigmented skin occurred, at least in part, independently in Europe and East Asia."
20229273,20229273,A polymorphism of microRNA196a genome region was associated with decreased risk of glioma in Chinese population.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play important roles in regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. Aberrant expression and structural alternation of miRNAs are considered to participate in tumorigenesis and cancer development. Recently, different genotypes of miR-196a polymorphisms (SNP, rs11614913) were found to be associated with the survival of patients with lung cancer and increased risk of breast cancer. To further investigate whether this polymorphism may influence glioma risk or not, we examined the SNP allele frequency in Chinese population. Our data shows the genotype CC of miR-196a (rs11614913) polymorphism is associated with decreased risk of glioma in the Chinese population (OR = 0.74, 95% CI:0.56-0.98). Furthermore, a significant association was observed between this genotype and glioma risk in the subgroups of adult glioma (OR = 0.73, 95% CI:0.55-0.98), male glioma (OR = 0.69, 95% CI:0.48-0.99) and patients with glioblastoma (OR = 0.58, 95% CI:0.37-0.91). This was the first study investigating the association between the miR-196a rs11614913 and glioma risk. Compared with the results from previous studies in lung cancer and breast cancer, our data suggest a different genotype association in glioma. This may be related to the diversity on the tissue origin, tumor type, tumorigenesis, and developing process."
20209496,20209496,Possible association between polymorphisms of human vascular endothelial growth factor A gene and susceptibility to glioma in a Chinese population.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), one of the most predominant mediators of pathologic angiogenesis, plays a critical role in glioma carcinogenesis and development via promoting tumor growth. We hypothesized that VEGFA polymorphisms may influence glioma risk. We recently genotyped 9 VEGFA single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 766 glioma patients and 824 cancer-free controls selected from a Chinese population. We evaluated the glioma risk conferred by individual SNPs, haplotypes as well as cumulative SNP effect. In the single-locus analysis, we found that rs2010963 (G+405C, G-634C) [odds ratio (OR) = 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.58; GC/CC vs. GG] and rs3025030 (OR = 2.21; 95% CI = 1.18-4.14; CC vs. GG/GC) were associated with increased risk for glioma, and rs3024994 (OR = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.47-0.94; CT/TT vs. CC) was associated with reduced glioma risk, albeit insignificant after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The haplotype-based analysis revealed that AGG in block 1 and ATT, ACT in block 2 were associated with 20-40% reductions in glioma risk. The inverse association of haplotype AGG containing rs2010963G remained significant after correction for multiple testing (p = 0.002, p(corrected) = 0.022). The aforementioned 3 SNPs revealed a significant cumulative risk effect; the increased risk for glioma was 1.38-fold for each additional adverse genotype he or she carries (p(trend) = 8.4 × 10(-5) ). Our findings suggested that VEGFA variants may be involved in glioma risk. Larger studies with ethnically diverse populations are warranted to confirm the results reported in this investigation."

However, only 10% - 20% of chronic heavy smokers develop systematic COPD. We hypothesized that the inheritance of gene polymorphisms could influence the development of COPD, which was investigated by studying two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in exon 1 of the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) gene."
20228709,20228709,The association analysis of TBX6 polymorphism with susceptibility to congenital scoliosis in a Chinese Han population.,A case-control association study was conducted to investigate the genetic etiology for congenital scoliosis (CS) in a Chinese Han population.
20188135,20188135,Association of a variant in MIR 196A2 with susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma in male Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs with regulatory functions as tumor suppressors and oncogenes. Recent studies have implicated that the rs11614913 SNP in MIR196A2 was associated with susceptibility of lung cancer, congenital heart disease, breast cancer and shortened survival time of nonsmall cell lung cancer. To assess whether this polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to and clinicopathologic characteristics of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a total of 560 patients with chronic HBV infection and 391 healthy volunteers were enrolled, and MIR196A2 polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR). In our study group, there was no significant association between MIR196A2 polymorphism and the risk of HBV-related HCC in all subjects, however, the risk of HCC was significantly higher with MIR196A2 rs11614913 CC genotype or C allele compared with those with the TT genotype or T allele in male patients. Furthermore, in a subsequent analysis of the association between this polymorphism and clinicopathologic characteristics, there was still no significant difference in both the distribution of genotype or allelic frequency. However, we observed that the T allele was significantly more frequent in male HCC patients with lymphatic metastasis. Our results suggested that MIR196A2 polymorphism was associated with susceptibility to HBV-related HCC in a male Chinese population."
20182806,20182806,Identification of three novel SNPs and association with carcass traits in porcine TNNI1 and TNNI2.,"In this study, two novel SNPs (EU743939:g.5174T>C in intron 4 and EU743939:g.8350C>A in intron 7) in TNNI1 and one SNP (EU696779:g.1167C>T in intron 3) in TNNI2 were identified by PCR-RFLP (PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism) using XbaI, MspI and SmaI restriction enzyme, respectively. The allele frequencies of three novel SNPs were determined in the genetically diverse pig breeds including ten Chinese indigenous pigs and three Western commercial pig breeds. Association analysis of the SNPs with the carcass traits were conducted in a Large White × Meishan F(2) pig population. The linkage of two SNPs (g.5174T>C and g.8350C>A) in TNNI1 gene had significant effect on fat percentage. Besides these, the g.5174T>C polymorphism was also significantly associated with skin percentage (P < 0.05), shoulder fat thickness (P < 0.05) and backfat thickness between sixth and seventh ribs (P < 0.05). The significant effects of g.1167C>T polymorphism in TNNI2 gene on fat percentage (P < 0.01), lean meat percentage (P < 0.05), lion eye area (P < 0.05), thorax-waist backfat thickness (P < 0.01) and average backfat thickness (P < 0.05) were also found."
20186840,20186840,A genetic variation in the fat mass- and obesity-associated gene is associated with obesity and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in a Chinese population.,"Recently, a genome-wide association study identified a strong association between the fat mass- and obesity-associated rs9939609 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and the risk of obesity in European population. However, the results in Chinese population were reported to be contradictory. Therefore, our aim was to examine whether this SNP is associated with obesity and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Chinese population."
20177132,20177132,COX-2 is associated with periodontitis in Europeans.,"COX-2 plays an important role in periodontitis by mediating inflammatory reactions in periodontal tissues, and the COX-2 polymorphisms rs20417 and rs689466 have been reported to be associated with periodontitis in populations of Taiwanese and Chinese ethnicity. To test whether these variants were associated with periodontitis in populations of European ethnicity, we genotyped the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs689466 and rs6681231, the latter a haplotype tagging SNP (htSNP) for rs20417 (r2>0.95), in our large-analysis population of individuals with aggressive (n = 532) and chronic periodontitis (n = 1052), and 2873 healthy control individuals. The rare G allele of htSNP rs6681231 was associated with aggressive periodontitis prior to and after adjustment for the covariates smoking, diabetes, and gender, with an odds ratio of 1.57 (95% confidence interval 1.18-2.08; p = 0.002). The validation of the association of rs20417 by the htSNP rs6681231 provides evidence for a general genetic risk of COX-2 variants in the pathogenesis of periodontitis."
20176143,20176143,Analysis of the association between BTNL2 polymorphism and tuberculosis in Chinese Han population.,"BTNL2 gene, a MHC class II gene-linked butyrophilin family member, has been recently associated with the inflammatory autoimmune diseases, such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis and leprosy. This diseases show phenotypic features of granulomatous disease. Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms in BTNL2 have been investigated as a candidate gene for tuberculosis in a case-control association study in the South African Coloured population. But, no significant association was detected between any of the polymorphisms investigated and TB, including rs2076530 SNP that was previously found to be associated with sarcoidosis. In this study, we genotyped 6 SNPs using SNaPshot in 286 tuberculosis cases and 608 controls in Chinese. Our genetic study revealed a significant association between the rs3763313, rs9268494, rs9268492 SNPs in the BTNL2 gene and tuberculosis. And haplotypes 1-5, and 8 (C-A-G-T-G-A, C-A-G-T-G-G, C-A-T-G-C-A, C-A-T-G-C-G, and C-G-T-G-C-G, T-A-T-G-C-A) presented a significant association with susceptibility to tuberculosis. We found that BTNL2 gene was linked to tuberculosis in Chinese Han population."
20155449,20155449,Identification of common variants within KCNK17 in Chinese Han population.,"KCNK17 is a member of the acid-sensitive subfamily of tandem pore K(+) channels, which are open at all membrane potentials an red contribute to cellular resting membrane potential. Recent genome-wide study (GWA) has shown that variants within KCNK17 confer genetic susceptibility for increasing ischemic stroke. In an effort to discover additional polymorphism(s), we scrutinized the genetic polymorphisms in the KCNK17. By direct DNA sequencing in 32 individuals, we identified nine sequence variants within the 16 kb of whole KCNK17 gene: one in exon1, one in intron and seven in the promoter region. Haplotypes, their frequencies and linkage disequilibrium coefficients (D'), among polymorphisms were estimated. All the polymorphisms in the 5'-flanking region (SNP2-SNP7) being in complete (or nearly complete) association with each other in the promoter region maybe produce synergistic effect to regulate the expression of KCNK17 gene and then have an influence on the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular diseases. The common haplotypes were observed comprising 88.9% of the total haplotypes in the same block. Bioinformatic analysis predicted several potential transcriptional factors binding sites by SNP -95, -134, -596 and -846. However, these binding sites need to be experimentally verified. The information concerning genetic polymorphisms of KCNK17 gene might provide valuable information for future genetic studies of diseases."

20182758,20182758,Meta-analysis of association between variation in the PDE4D gene and ischemic cerebral infarction risk in Asian populations.,"Phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) was found to be associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke by Iceland researchers in 2003. Replication studies have produced conflicting results. A recent meta-analysis reported that no genetic variant of PDE4D demonstrated a reproducible association with ischemic stroke, especially when analyzed with respect to white subjects exclusively. In this study, we aimed to determine the association between PDE4D and ischemic infarction risk in Asian populations. After collecting all case-control studies in English or Chinese related to the association between PDE4D and ischemic infarction in Asian people, strict selection criteria and exclusion criteria were determined, and a fixed or random effects model was used on the basis of heterogeneity. To measure the strength of the genetic association, a pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each gene variant. Publication bias was evaluated. None of the Asian subjects were heterozygous for SNP 45 or SNP 41. Only seven studies involving SNP 83 and SNP 87 had sufficient data to allow inclusion into meta-analyses. Statistically significant associations with ischemic infarction in the Asian populations were determined for SNP 83 C allele (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.03-1.43) and SNP 83 CC genotype (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.14-1.77), but not for SNP 83 CC + CT genotypes or SNP 87. PDE4D was associated with ischemic infarction risk in Asian people, and SNP 83 was an important biomarker."

20135074,20135074,A genetic variant in the gene encoding fibrinogen beta chain predicted development of hypertension in Chinese men.,"Fibrinogen, a major determinant of blood viscosity, is an acute phase protein associated with cardiovascular disease. We studied the association of hypertension with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding the fibrinogen beta chain (FGB). Three tagging SNPs (rs1025154, rs4220 and rs1044291) were selected from the HapMap database on Han Chinese. Genotypes were determined in 1,294 unrelated subjects from the Hong Kong Cardiovascular Risk Factor Prevalence Study cohort. There were 199 hypertensive subjects at baseline. Among 1,095 subjects normotensive at baseline, 178 developed hypertension during a median follow-up period of 6.4 years. Among the three tagging SNPs, rs4220 showed significant association with hypertension at both baseline (odds ratio [OR]=1.49, p=0.004) and at follow-up (OR=1.32, p=0.013). The minor A allele of this SNP was associated with higher plasma fibrinogen level (beta=0.144, p<0.001 at baseline and beta=0.130, p<0.001 at follow-up). Among subjects normotensive at baseline, this SNP was also associated with the development of hypertension in men (OR=1.52, p=0.022), but not in women. The SNP rs4220 in FGB , which leads to the substitution of arginine by lysine at position 448, is independently associated with plasma fibrinogen level and hypertension in Hong Kong Chinese. This suggests a possible causal role of fibrinogen in hypertension development, especially in men."

20130895,20130895,The association of the BLK gene with SLE was replicated in Chinese Han.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Recently, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the region of B lymphoid tyrosine kinase (BLK) have been shown to be associated with SLE in Caucasian population. In this paper, we genotyped SNP rs2248932 in 1,396 SLE patients of Chinese Han and 4,362 ethnically matched control subjects by using the Sequenom MassArray system. We confirmed that SNP rs2248932 in BLK gene was significantly associated with SLE (P = 1.41 x 10(-8) for the allele frequency, Odds ratio [OR] = 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66-0.82).The association of BLK in Chinese SLE patients was consistent with a dominant model (P = 8.88 x 10(-9), OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.61-0.79). In contrast to the Caucasian, this risk allele was the major allele in the Chinese Han; the risk allele frequency was higher in Chinese Han than in Caucasian. We did not find the association between this SNP and any subphenotype of SLE. The SNP rs2248932 was correlated to the expression of BLK mRNA. We conclude that the association of the BLK region with SLE was replicated in Chinese Han population living in mainland."

20127135,20127135,Association analysis of CD40 gene polymorphism with acute coronary syndrome.,"Current evidence shows that the CD40-CD40 ligand (CD40-CD40L) system plays a crucial role in the development, progression and outcome of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The aim of this study is to investigate whether a CD40 gene (-1C/T) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with ACS and CD40 expression. We included controls (n = 163) and patients with either ACS (n = 210) or stable angina (SA, n = 189) in the study. The gene polymorphism was measured using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and identified by sequencing. CD40 expression on platelets was detected by flow cytometry. The results showed that the frequency of the CC genotype of CD40 gene in the ACS group was significantly higher than in the SA and control groups (P < 0.001), while the TT genotype frequency in the ACS group was significantly lower than that of the SA and control groups (P < 0.001). The C-allele frequency of the ACS group was higher than that of the SA and control groups (P < 0.001). The C allele increased the risk of ACS when compared with the SA group (OR = 1.841, 95% CI: 1.390-2.437) and the control groups (OR = 1.877, 95% CI: 1.402-2.515). No significant differences in genotypes or allele frequencies were found between the SA and control groups. CD40 expression on platelets in patients with C-allele carriers was significant higher than in the T-allele carriers in each group. In conclusion, our results suggested that the CD40 gene (-1C/T) polymorphism was associated with ACS in Chinese people. The -1C-allele gene carriers had a higher expression of CD40 and an increased risk of suffering from ACS."

SREBF-2 1784G > C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs2228314) and SCAP 2386A > G variant (rs12487736) are associated with early onset myocardial infarction (MI) and sudden cardiac death in middle-aged men. We investigated whether these two SNPs are determinants of premature coronary artery disease (CAD) in a Chinese population. We studied 431 consecutive patients, including 197 with coronary stenosis ≥50% or previous MI and 234 controls without documented CAD (males <55 years and females <65 years). All subjects were genotyped for two SNPs by using the ligase detection reaction method. The three genotypes GG, GC, and CC were present in rs2228314 and two genotypes AA and AG in rs12487736. No gender-specific differences were found in genotype distribution and allele frequencies of these two SNPs between patients with and without CAD. The biochemical and clinical risk factors among participants were not influenced by variants at rs2228314. Logistic regression did not detect the association of these two SNPs with premature CAD, nor did there exist any association of these two SNPs among groups of patients with 0, 1, 2, and 3-vessel disease (all P > 0.05).

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of a DNMT3A promoter genetic variant on its transcriptional activity and to evaluate the association between DNMT3A gene polymorphism and the susceptibility to gastric cancer (GC) and oesophagus carcinoma (EC) in the Chinese population.
20109228,20109228,Haplotypes of intron 4 of the estrogen receptor alpha gene and hip fractures: a replication study in Caucasians.,"Despite their great impact, few genetic association studies have used hip fractures as an endpoint. However, the association of two polymorphisms on intron 4 of estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) with hip fractures was recently reported in a Chinese population. The aim of this study was to investigate whether such association is also present in Caucasians."
20094064,20094064,Association of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene polymorphisms with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the Japanese population.,"The oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene, which is located on chromosome 3p25.3, has been implicated as a candidate gene for susceptibility of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Positive associations between OXTR and ASD have been reported in earlier studies. However, the results were inconsistent and demand further studies. In this study, we investigated the associations between OXTR and ASD in a Japanese population by analyzing 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using both family-based association test (FBAT) and population-based case-control test. No significant signal was detected in the FBAT test. However, significant differences were observed in allelic frequencies of four SNPs, including rs2254298 between patients and controls. The risk allele of rs2254298 was 'A', which was consistent with the previous study in Chinese, and not with the observations in Caucasian. The difference in the risk allele of this SNP in previous studies might be attributable to an ethnic difference in the linkage disequilibrium structure between the Asians and Caucasians. In addition, haplotype analysis exhibits a significant association between a five-SNP haplotype and ASD, including rs22542898. In conclusion, our study might support that OXTR has a significant role in conferring the risk of ASD in the Japanese population."
20100009,20100009,Single nucleotide polymorphism in the methyl-CpG binding domain 4 gene and the risk for immune thrombocytopenic purpura in Chinese population.,"Epigenetics might contribute to autoimmune diseases including immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Methyl-CpG binding domain protein 4 (MBD4) plays an important role in DNA methylation and transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The polymorphism of the MBD4 gene may influence MBD4 activity on gene expression profiles, thereby influencing individual susceptibility to ITP. To verify this hypothesis, we investigated the association between the MBD4 polymorphism and the risk for ITP in the Chinese population. The polymorphism of MBD4 rs140693 was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). In this study, there was no significant difference in genotype and alleles distribution between the ITP patients and the controls. Similar results were observed between the two groups when stratified by age and disease course including acute childhood, chronic childhood, acute adult and chronic adult. In the conclusion, MBD4 polymorphism may not be a stratification marker to predict the susceptibility to ITP, at least in Chinese population."
20096396,20096396,Association of JAG1 with bone mineral density and osteoporotic fractures: a genome-wide association study and follow-up replication studies.,"Bone mineral density (BMD), a diagnostic parameter for osteoporosis and a clinical predictor of fracture, is a polygenic trait with high heritability. To identify genetic variants that influence BMD in different ethnic groups, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 800 unrelated Southern Chinese women with extreme BMD and carried out follow-up replication studies in six independent study populations of European descent and Asian populations including 18,098 subjects. In the meta-analysis, rs2273061 of the Jagged1 (JAG1) gene was associated with high BMD (p = 5.27 x 10(-8) for lumbar spine [LS] and p = 4.15 x 10(-5) for femoral neck [FN], n = 18,898). This SNP was further found to be associated with the low risk of osteoporotic fracture (p = 0.009, OR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.57-0.93, n = 1881). Region-wide and haplotype analysis showed that the strongest association evidence was from the linkage disequilibrium block 5, which included rs2273061 of the JAG1 gene (p = 8.52 x 10(-9) for LS and 3.47 x 10(-5) at FN). To assess the function of identified variants, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated the binding of c-Myc to the ""G"" but not ""A"" allele of rs2273061. A mRNA expression study in both human bone-derived cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells confirmed association of the high BMD-related allele G of rs2273061 with higher JAG1 expression. Our results identify the JAG1 gene as a candidate for BMD regulation in different ethnic groups, and it is a potential key factor for fracture pathogenesis."

20087404,20087404,Genetic variants in the BDNF gene and therapeutic response to risperidone in schizophrenia patients: a pharmacogenetic study.,"Risperidone is a widely used atypical antipsychotic agent that produces considerable interindividual differences in patient response. We investigated the pharmacogenetic relationship between the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene and response to risperidone in 127 Han Chinese schizophrenic patients. Three functional polymorphisms, (GT)(n) dinucleotide repeat polymorphism, C-270T, and the rs6265G/A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), were genotyped and analyzed for association, with reduction of Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores following an 8-week period of risperidone monotherapy. For individual polymorphic analysis, we found that the frequency of the 230-bp allele of the (GT)(n) polymorphism was much higher in responders (47.95%) than in nonresponders (32.41%) and the difference was statistically significant even after Bonferroni's adjustment (for the 230-bp allele: adjusted P=0.039). For haplotype-based analyses of the three polymorphisms, no positive finding was observed in the global test, but in specific haplotype tests, two haplotypes were also significantly related to response to risperidone (for haplotype 230-bp/C-270/rs6265G: P=0.0009; for haplotype 234-bp/C-270/rs6265A: P=0.043), indicating that patients with the 230-bp allele of the (GT)(n) polymorphism or the 230-bp/C-270/rs6265G haplotype responded better to risperidone than those with other alleles or haplotypes, and that the positive effect of the individual haplotype 230-bp/C-270/rs6265G was mainly driven by the 230-bp allele. These findings demonstrate that the individual and combinatorial genetic variants in the BDNF gene might have a role in the therapeutic response to risperidone in the Han Chinese population."

20061430,20061430,Obesity susceptibility genetic variants identified from recent genome-wide association studies: implications in a chinese population.,Recent large-scale genome-wide association studies identified novel genetic variants associated with obesity and body mass index (BMI) in addition to the well-described FTO and MC4R genetic variants.
20054692,20054692,Genetic polymorphism of PITX1 in susceptibility to knee osteoarthritis in a Chinese Han population: a case-control study.,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and the precise etiology of this disease remains unclear. Genetic factors play a considerable role in pathogenesis of OA. Several OA-susceptibility genes have been identified. Recently, a new emerging role of pitx1 transcription factor in OA pathogenesis has been reported. Paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 1 (PITX1) has been implicated in hind limb development of mice and is essential to maintain cartilage function. Because of the different expression in the knee joint between OA and normal people, PITX1 may be involved in etiology and pathogenesis of OA. The present study is to evaluate the association of the PITX1 polymorphism (rs479632) with knee OA in a Chinese Han population. A case-control association study was conducted. The polymorphism was genotyped in 581 patients who had primary symptomatic knee OA with radiographic confirmation and in 570 matched controls. Allelic and genotypic frequencies were compared between patients and control subjects. No significant difference was detected in genotype or allele distribution between knee OA and control groups (all P > 0.05). The association was also negative even after stratification by sex. Furthermore, no association between the SNP genotype and the clinical variables age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and Kellgren/Lawrence (K/L) score was observed in OA patients. The present study suggests that the PITX1 polymorphism (rs479632) is not a risk factor for knee OA susceptibility in the Chinese Han population. Further studies are needed to give a global view of this polymorphism in pathogenesis of OA."
20051317,20051317,The chitinase 3-like 1 gene and schizophrenia: evidence from a multi-center case-control study and meta-analysis.,"The chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) gene acts as a cellular survival factor in response to several environmental and psychosocial stresses. The expression level of CHI3L1 was increased in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex regions of patients with schizophrenia. Genetic variants of the CHI3L1 gene have been significantly associated with schizophrenia in two distinct ethnic groups, the Chinese and Irish populations. The aims of this study are to confirm the association between the CHI3L1 gene and schizophrenia in a Japanese population using the largest sample size to date (1463 cases and 1795 controls) and perform a meta-analysis of the combined samples (3005 cases, 3825 controls and 601 trios). We found significant associations between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 4/rs4950928 (p=0.009), which is located in the promoter region of the CHI3L1 gene, and haplotypes including this SNP and schizophrenia (the most significant global p<0.001). As the meta-analysis of the combined samples showed significant heterogeneity among studies of SNP3/rs10399805 (p=0.026) and SNP4 (p<0.001), we performed meta-analyses separately in the Japanese (2033 cases and 2365 controls) and Chinese populations (412 cases, 464 controls and 601 trios), the major groups analyzed in association studies of the CHI3L1 gene. The meta-analysis in Japanese populations showed stronger evidence for the association of schizophrenia with SNP4 (p=0.003), while the meta-analysis in Chinese populations showed an association with a different variant (SNP3) (p=0.003). We conclude that the genetic variants in the CHI3L1 gene have ethnic heterogeneity and confer a susceptibility to schizophrenia in Asian populations."
20043861,20043861,No association of the polymorphisms of the frizzled-related protein gene with peak bone mineral density in Chinese nuclear families.,"The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway plays an important role in skeletal development. Polymorphisms of frizzled-related protein (FRZB), an antagonist of this pathway, may generate variations in bone mineral density (BMD). In this study, we analyzed the association between FRZB genotypes and peak BMD variation in the spines and hips of two relatively large samples of Chinese female-offspring and male-offspring nuclear families."
20050988,20050988,Association of disease-predisposition polymorphisms of the melatonin receptors and sunshine duration in the global human populations.,"Melatonin is predominantly involved in signaling circadian and seasonal rhythms, and its synthesis is regulated by the environmental light/dark cycle. The selection pressure by geographically different environmental light/dark cycles, which is predominantly determined by sunshine duration, on the global distribution of genetic polymorphisms in the melatonin pathway is not well understood. Recent genetic association studies identified various disease-predisposition polymorphisms in this pathway. We investigated the correlations between the prevalence of these clinically important single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and sunshine duration among worldwide human populations from twelve regions in the CEPH-HGDP database rs4753426, a recently reported predisposition SNP for type 2 diabetes in the promoter of the MT(2) melatonin receptor gene (MTNR1B), which was not included in the CEPH-HGDP genotyping array, was additionally genotyped. This SNP showed a marginally significant correlation in 760 CEPH-HGDP DNA samples (r = -0.5346, P = 0.0733), and it showed the most prominent association among the candidate melatonin pathway SNPs examined. To control for population structure, which may lead to a false positive correlation, we genotyped this SNP in a replication set of 1792 subjects from China. The correlation was confirmed among Chinese populations (r = -0.8694, P = 0.0002), and was also statistically significant after correction of other climatic and geographical covariants in multiple regression analysis (beta = -0.907, P = 1.94 x 10(-5)). Taken together, it suggests that the human melatonin signaling pathway, particularly MT(2) melatonin receptor may have undergone a selective pressure in response to global variation in sunshine duration."

20070852,20070852,Linkage disequilibrium pattern in asthma candidate genes from 5q31-q33 in the Singapore Chinese population.,"Studies have shown linkage between microsatellite markers from the chromosome 5q31-q33 region with asthma, atopy and total IgE levels in the Singapore Chinese population. However, subsequent case-control studies failed to show association between the polymorphisms in the candidate genes from this region and asthma or related phenotypes. In this study, we investigated 20 asthma candidate genes from this region for all possible informative polymorphisms within our population, linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure and tagging SNP transferability from HapMap populations. We re-sequenced these genes and identified 267 polymorphisms including 26 insertion-deletions, four microsatellite markers and 237 single nucleotide polymorphisms. The region contained 17 distinct LD blocks with the largest within the serine peptidase inhibitor kazal type 5 (SPINK5) gene spanning 23 kb. Of the 267 polymorphisms identified, 40% are represented in HapMap Han Chinese from Beijing and 29% in Han Chinese from Denver. 72% of the polymorphisms can be represented by tagged SNPs from the HapMap Beijing Han Chinese population and are highly correlated in terms of minor allele frequencies and LD structure. Our data suggest that although the HapMap Han Chinese population from Beijing is very similar to the Singapore Chinese population, this similarity is insufficient to account for up to 28% of the polymorphisms in the local population."
21537394,21537394,Genetic variation and association analyses of NEDD4 gene in Kazak Chinese patients with hypertension.,"To analyze the association between the genetic variations of neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated 4 gene (NEDD4) and hypertension in Kazakh Chinese. The sequences of NEDD4 gene exons were sequenced in 96 Kazakh Chinese with hypertension to identify representative variations. A case-control study was conducted by genotyping the representative variations in 287 Kazakh hypertensives and 411 normotensives. Replication population was 343 Uygur hypertensives and 724 normotensives. All subjects were selected from population-based cross-sectional studies of metabolic disease. Thirteen novel and 15 known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) or mutations, including 6 missense mutations, were identified. Of the four representative SNPs geno-typed, only rs2303580 was association with hypertension in Kazakh (additive P/Pc=0.020/0.160) without Bonferroni's correction. The result was replicated in Uygur (additive/dominant P=0.089/0.028, Pc=0.174/0.056). By adjusting for age and BMI, the observed association would no longer be statistically significant in Kazakh (additive OR (95%CI) 1.035(0.802-1.336), but remained statistically significant in Uygur ( additive/dominant ORs (95%CI) 1.323 (1.069-1.637), 1.521(1.146-2.020)). The rs2303580 genotypes were not association with blood pressure levels in Kazakh. Although by multiple linear regression analysis and by applying Bonferroni's correction, the genotypes were significant association with diastolic blood pressure levels (AA>AG>GG) in Uygur normotensive controls (P/Pc=0.003/0.018), the direction of difference was not in accordance with the association between the qualitative hypertension phenotype and the genotype shown (G risk allele). Our data indicates that the association between the NEDD4 genetic polymorphisms and hypertension phenotype should be replicated in further studies using larger and racially diverse populations."
20033742,20033742,Genetic association of the interaction between the BDNF and GSK3B genes and major depressive disorder in a Chinese population.,"Alterations in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-signaling pathways may play an important role in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). Several lines of evidence have suggested that gene-gene interactions may confer susceptibility to MDD. The aim of this study was to analyze the single and combined effects of genes in the BDNF signal-transduction pathway on MDD in a Chinese population. We recruited 447 patients with MDD and 432 age- and gender-matched control subjects. Five SNPs in three BDNF signal-transduction pathway genes (BDNF, GSK3B and AKT1) were used in association analyses. An allelic association between the GSK3B SNP rs6782799 and MDD was found in our sample (allelic: chi(2) = 5.24, P = 0.022, corrected P = 0.107; genotypic: chi(2) = 5.55, P = 0.062) with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.25 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.52). Further gene-gene interaction analyses showed a significant effect of a two-locus BDNF/GSK3B interaction with MDD (GSK3B rs6782799 and BDNF rs7124442) (corrected P = 0.011), and also for a three-locus interaction (GSK3B rs6782799, BDNF rs6265 and BDNF rs7124442) (corrected P = 0.019). Individuals carrying the combination of two risk alleles showed an OR value of 4.00 (95% CI 2.05-7.79), while those with the combination of three risk alleles gave the largest OR value of 4.46 (95% CI 2.15-9.24). Taken together, these findings support the assertion that the GSK3B gene is an important susceptibility factor for MDD in a Han Chinese population."

20012871,20012871,A single-nucleotide polymorphism of the TNFSF4 gene is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus in Chinese Han population.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease with complex genetic inheritance. Recently, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily gene TNFSF4 have been shown to be associated with SLE in European and Hong Kong Chinese populations. But it is unknown whether it is also associated with the disease in Mainland Chinese Han population. We genotyped the SNPs rs1234315 near the TNFSF4 gene in 1,344 SLE patients and 4,315 controls of Chinese Han population and confirmed the association between the SNP and the SLE [odds ratios (ORs) of 1.45 and P values of 1.5 × 10(-16)]. The stratification analyses showed that rs1234315 was more strongly associated with SLE patients with arthritis. Our study not only suggested that the TNFSF4 gene was associated with SLE in Chinese Han population, but also implied that it might be a common genetic factor predisposing to the development of SLE in multiple populations."
20012629,20012629,Programmed cell death 1 gene polymorphisms is associated with ankylosing spondylitis in Chinese Han population.,"Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) has been reported to have a genetic association in several autoimmune diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of PD-1 polymorphisms and haplotypes with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in Chinese Han population. In a case-control association study, three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), PD-1.3 G/A, PD-1.5 C/T and PD-1.9 T/C, were genotyped in 216 AS patients and 264 healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. All genotype distributions in the patients and in the controls were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The associations of genotypes and alleles with AS were analyzed. The genotype distributions of PD-1.9 were significantly different between the patients with AS and the controls (P = 0.025). The frequencies of TC genotype and T allele of PD-1.9 were higher in the patients than those in the controls (P = 0.026 and 0.004). No association for PD-1.5 in AS was found, and PD-1.3 was non-polymorphic in Chinese Han population. Moreover, the frequency of the CT haplotype (PD-1.5 C/T, PD-1.9 T/C) was significantly higher in AS patients than the controls (21.6 vs. 13.9%, P = 0.002). The CC haplotype was more common in the controls than in the patients (57.1 vs. 44.6%, P = 0.000). The results support a genetic association between the PD-1 polymorphism and susceptibility to AS in Chinese Han population."

19951440,19951440,Analyses of associations between three positionally cloned asthma candidate genes and asthma or asthma-related phenotypes in a Chinese population.,"Six asthma candidate genes, ADAM33, NPSR1, PHF11, DPP10, HLA-G, and CYFIP2, located at different chromosome regions have been positionally cloned following the reported linkage studies. For ADAM33, NPSR1, and CYFIP2, the associations with asthma or asthma-related phenotypes have been studied in East Asian populations such as Chinese and Japanese. However, for PHF11, DPP10, and HLA-G, none of the association studies have been conducted in Asian populations.

19933183,19933183,Association of NR2E3 but not NRL mutations with retinitis pigmentosa in the Chinese population.,"Purpose. Mutations in the NR2E3 and NRL genes have been implicated in both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP). In this study, the mutation profiles of these two genes were investigated in Chinese RP patients. Methods. In 172 RP patients and 360 normal control subjects (180 from Hong Kong and 180 from Beijing), the coding exons and the exon-intron boundaries of NR2E3 and NRL were screened by direct DNA sequencing after PCR. Association analysis was performed for common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), whereas in silico programs were used for analysis of rare missense variants. Results. In NR2E3, 14 novel sequence changes have been identified. Two missense variants, p.G56R and p.V118M, were exclusively found in RP patients with frequencies at 1.2% (2/172) and 1.7% (3/172), respectively. All five patients were found to be heterozygous for these two mutations. Computational analysis suggested functional defects on the NR2E3 protein, indicating disease-causing roles. The p.E121K variant of NR2E3, which reportedly caused enhanced S-cone syndrome (ESCS) in Caucasians, was found concurrently in RP patients (13.4%) and control subjects from Hong Kong (10.5%) and Beijing (12.8%). In NRL, six novel sequence changes were identified, none of them associated with RP. Conclusions. In this study, NR2E3 mutations (p.G56R, p.V118M) were found to be responsible for approximately 2.9% of overall RP in Chinese patients, comparable to the contributions of RHO and RP1 mutations. The p.E121K in NR2E3 is a common SNP in the Chinese, suggesting another genetic or environmental factor is involved in its causative role in ESCS in Caucasians."

Using over 350,000 genome-wide autosomal SNPs in over 6000 Han Chinese samples from ten provinces of China, our study revealed a one-dimensional ""north-south"" population structure and a close correlation between geography and the genetic structure of the Han Chinese. The north-south population structure is consistent with the historical migration pattern of the Han Chinese population. Metropolitan cities in China were, however, more diffused ""outliers,"" probably because of the impact of modern migration of peoples. At a very local scale within the Guangdong province, we observed evidence of population structure among dialect groups, probably on account of endogamy within these dialects. Via simulation, we show that empirical levels of population structure observed across modern China can cause spurious associations in GWAS if not properly handled. In the Han Chinese, geographic matching is a good proxy for genetic matching, particularly in validation and candidate-gene studies in which population stratification cannot be directly accessed and accounted for because of the lack of genome-wide data, with the exception of the metropolitan cities, where geographical location is no longer a good indicator of ancestral origin. Our findings are important for designing GWAS in the Chinese population, an activity that is expected to intensify greatly in the near future."
19930247,19930247,HMGA2 is confirmed to be associated with human adult height.,"Recent genome-wide association studies have identified a novel polymorphism, rs1042725, in the HMGA2 gene for human adult height, a highly heritable complex trait. Replications in independent populations are needed to evaluate a positive finding and determine its generality. Thus, we performed a replication study to examine the associations between polymorphisms in HMGA2 and adult height in two US Caucasian populations (an unrelated sample of 998 subjects and a family-based sample of 8385 subjects) and a Chinese population (1638 unrelated Han subjects). We confirmed the association between rs1042725 in HMGA2 and adult height both in the unrelated and family-based Caucasian populations (overall P= 4.25 x 10(-9)). Another two SNPs (rs7968902 and rs7968682), which were in high linkage disequilibrium with rs1042725, also achieved the significance level in both Caucasian populations (overall P= 6.34 x 10(-7), and 2.72 x 10(-9), respectively). Our results provide strong support to the initial finding. Moreover, SNP rs1042725 was firstly found to be associated with adult height (P= 0.008) in the Chinese population, and the effect is in the same direction as in the Caucasian populations, suggesting that it is a common variant across different populations. Our study further highlights the importance of the HMGA2 gene's involvement in normal growth."
19922123,19922123,Clinical and genetic features of patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in south-west China.,"The objective of this study was to analyse clinical and genetic features of patients with sporadic ALS in south-west China. All patients diagnosed with adult-onset sporadic ALS were consecutively followed up, and their clinical characteristics were collected. The frequencies of alleles of six SNPs in the FLJ10986 gene and the association between these SNPs and the clinical features of ALS were analysed. One hundred and sixty-one patients were included in the study. The mean age of onset was 50.9+/-11.4 years. The mean diagnostic delay was 16.5+/-14.3 months and the mean disease duration was 30.7+/-23.5 months. Forty patients (24.2%) died during the period of follow-up. Positive correlation between mean delay and disease duration was found, as was negative correlation between onset age, mean delay and disease duration. The frequency of the 'G' variant of the SNP (rs10493256) was significantly higher than that in a control population. There was no significant difference in the frequencies of variant alleles regarding clinical features. In conclusion, SNP (rs10493256) in the FLJ10986 gene appears to increase the risk of developing sporadic ALS in our Chinese population. Our Clinical findings are in line with other studies. No association between the polymorphisms and clinical features was found."
19919828,19919828,The association of functional polymorphisms of IL-6 gene promoter with ischemic stroke: analysis in two Chinese populations.,"Polymorphisms of G-572C and G-174C in the interleukin-6 (IL-6) promoter can affect both the transcription and secretion of IL-6 and may be involved in inflammation related to and the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke (IS). However, whether IL-6 polymorphisms are indeed risk factors for IS remains controversial. We recruited 748 Chinese IS patients diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 24h of symptom onset and 748 normal healthy controls from two ethnic populations and performed two case-control studies in order to assess the nature of the polymorphisms of IL-6 and any links with IS. Common polymorphic loci in the IL-6 gene promoter were determined by TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between IL-6 genotypes and a diagnosis of IS. We found that the C allele frequency at the -174 promoter region of IL-6 was extremely low in both IS patients and controls in both ethnic groups. The G allele of the promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) G-572C was more common in IS subjects than controls (P=0.004, corrected for multiple testing) in the Han population but not in the Uyghur population. GC carriage therefore increased the risk of IS in the Han ethnic group (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.13-1.86). In addition, the differences in GG and GC frequency between the two ethnic populations were significant. The C allele frequency at the -174 promoter region of IL-6 was rare in Chinese IS patients and controls from either ethnic group. We conclude that IL-6-572GC may be an independent risk factor for IS in the Chinese Han population."

19902814,19902814,Lack of association between the paraoxonase 1 Q/R192 single nucleotide polymorphism and stroke in a Chinese cohort.,Serum paraoxonase (PON1) is an HDL-associated esterase that hydrolyzes products of lipid peroxidation and prevents the oxidation of LDL. Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) was implicated in susceptibility to stroke in previous studies. We investigated the correlation between the paraoxonase Gln-Arg 192 polymorphism (PON1Q/R192) and stroke including cerebral hemorrhage and cerebral infarction.
19895338,19895338,The association between interleukin-23 receptor gene polymorphisms and systemic lupus erythematosus.,"The aim of this study was to investigate single-nucleotide polymorphism of the IL-23R gene and its possible relationship with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a Chinese population. We examined 139 SLE patients and 168 controls from Sichuan province in China. The genotyping of IL-23R is determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. These results indicate that there is no relationship between IL-23R polymorphisms and SLE in a Chinese population. Further studies are still needed to explore the complicated interaction between environmental factors and IL-23R polymorphisms in the risk of SLE, particularly in ethnically different populations. There were no significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of rs10889677, rs1884444, and rs7517847 polymorphisms between the patients with SLE and the control group in a Chinese population (for rs10889677: odds ratio [OR] = 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.69-1.45; for rs1884444: OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.69-1.33; and for rs7517847: OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.67-1.27)."

19880550,19880550,Polymorphisms in the DNA repair gene XRCC1 and associations with systemic lupus erythematosus risk in the Taiwanese Han Chinese population.,"XRCC1 plays a central role in mammalian DNA repair processes. Two polymorphisms of XRCC1, rs1799782 (Arg > Trp at codon 194) and rs25487 (Arg > Gln at codon 399), are common in the Han Chinese population. Our objective was to analyze the relationship between these two functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the Taiwanese Han Chinese population. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) on 172 SLE patients and 160 normal controls. Our data indicate that the frequency of A/G at codon 399 differed between patients and controls (p = 0.01; odds ratio: 1.80; 95% confidence interval: 1.17-2.75), but the allelic frequency analysis did not reveal significant differences. For the SNP at codon 194, there were no differences in either allelic or genotype frequencies between SLE patients and normal subjects. Clinical association studies of SLE symptoms revealed the involvement of the A/G polymorphism at codon 399 in SLE pathogenesis. Our results indicate that a functional SNP at codon 399 of XRCC1 is associated with the development of SLE."
19931325,19931325,No association between AKT1 polymorphism and schizophrenia: a case-control study in a Korean population and a meta-analysis.,"V-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1) has been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Recent, independent studies in Caucasian, Japanese, Iranian, and Chinese populations have reported that the AKT1 gene may be associated with schizophrenia, but these results have yet to be replicated in other populations. In the present study, we performed a case-control association study between AKT1 and schizophrenia in a Korean population. We genotyped six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP1 (rs3803300), SNP2 (rs1130214), SNP3 (rs3730358), SNP4 (rs1130233), SNP5 (rs2494732), SNP A (rs2498804)) of AKT1, selected from previous reports, in a sample of 283 subjects with schizophrenia and 350 controls. No significant difference in single marker polymorphisms or haplotype frequencies of the six SNPs in the AKT1 gene was observed between controls and subjects with schizophrenia. In addition, we carried out an updated meta-analysis of the six SNPs, and found no evidence for an association between the six SNPs and schizophrenia. Taken together, our results do not support the hypothesis that AKT1 is a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia."

19875984,19875984,Common PCSK1 haplotypes are associated with obesity in the Chinese population.,"Prohormone convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1) genetic polymorphisms have recently been associated with obesity in European populations. This study aimed to examine whether common PCSK1 genetic variation is associated with obesity and related metabolic phenotypes in the Chinese population. We genotyped nine common tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNP) of the PCSK1 gene in 1,094 subjects of Chinese origin from the Stanford Asia-Pacific Program for Hypertension and Insulin Resistance (SAPPHIRe) family study. One SNP in the PCSK1 gene (rs155971) were nominally associated with risk of obesity in the SAPPHIRe cohort (P = 0.01). A common protective haplotype was associated with reduced risk of obesity (23.79% vs. 32.89%, P = 0.01) and smaller waist circumference (81.71 +/- 10.22 vs. 84.75 +/- 10.48 cm, P = 0.02). Another common haplotype was significantly associated with increased risk of obesity (37.07% vs. 23.84%, P = 0.005). The global P value for haplotype association with obesity was 0.02. We also identified a suggestive association of another PCSK1 SNP (rs3811951) with fasting glucose, fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA(IR)), triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.05, 0.003, 0.001, 0.04, and 0.04, respectively). These data indicate common PCSK1 genetic variants are associated with obesity in the Chinese population."

19889566,19889566,Evaluation of PINK1 variants in Indian Parkinson's disease patients.,"Mutations in PINK1 have been identified in familial and sporadic cases of early onset Parkinson's disease (PD). To determine the contribution of PINK1 variants in Indian PD patients, the gene was screened in 250 patients and 205 ethnically matched controls by polymerase chain reaction, single-stranded conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing. Two potentially pathogenic variants (Arg246Gln & Arg276Gln) were detected in the heterozygous state in 5 patients; none of the patients carried homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations. In addition, 13 other variants were identified, including a known polymorphism (Ala340Thr), a few synonymous or intronic changes, none of which are likely to be pathogenic. Unlike the Chinese population, the Ala340Thr variant did not show any association with PD in Indian population. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from dbSNP were genotyped in 531 normal, healthy individuals representing different ethnic groups of India. Most of the SNP markers were observed to be highly heterozygous among Indians, which could be used for segregation analysis of PINK1 alleles in familial PD cases."
19840113,19840113,Analysis of the nicastrin promoter rs10752637 polymorphism and its association with Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common, degenerative form of dementia characterized by the accumulation of plaques containing amyloid beta-peptides (A beta). Nicastrin (NCSTN) is a type I trans-membrane glycoprotein and an essential component of gamma-secretase, a multiprotein complex required for the production of the mature form of A beta. Overexpression of wild-type NCSTN increases A beta production, indicating that the strict regulation of NCSTN expression may play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of AD. In this study we investigated the effect of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs10752637), located in the promoter region of the NCSTN gene, on NCSTN promoter activity. First, the rs10752637 genotypes were determined in a Chinese population consisting of 462 patients with sporadic AD and 470 normal control subjects. The distributions of the rs10752637 genotypes and allele frequencies were significantly different between the AD and control groups, with the -922T allele significantly associated with the occurrence of AD. Reporter assays indicated that the rs10752637 -922T allele had a significantly increased promoter activity relative to the -922G allele. Furthermore, gel shift assays demonstrated that the -922T allele preferentially bound to components of nuclear extracts. Overall, our results indicate that the rs10752637 SNP can likely influence the expression of NCSTN, and that this may be an influencing factor during the pathogenesis of AD."

19816813,19816813,Association studies of interleukin-8 gene in Graves' disease and Graves' ophthalmopathy.,"Graves' disease (GD) is an autoimmune disorder, and the most common extrathyroidal manifestation is Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO), which is believed to be caused by a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Many studies have reported that interleukin-8 (IL-8), a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine, is associated with many autoimmune diseases and could increase the degree of lymphocyte infiltration within the thyroid gland. The aim of the present study is to elucidate whether IL-8 is associated with the development of GD and GO. The serum concentration of IL-8 was tested in 39 primary GD patients, 43 treated active GO patients, and 24 healthy controls. We also performed an association study with the IL-8 gene polymorphism rs2227306 between 642 patients and 648 healthy controls in Chinese population. Our data showed that the expression level of IL-8 was associated with the development of GD, and the C-allele frequency of SNP rs2227306 was significantly higher in GD and GO patients compared with healthy controls. These results suggest that IL-8 is strongly associated with GD and GD."

19793722,19793722,Genetic association of FOXO1A and FOXO3A with longevity trait in Han Chinese populations.,"FOXO1A and FOXO3A are two members of the FoxO family. FOXO3A has recently been linked to human longevity in Japanese, German and Italian populations. Here we tested the genetic contribution of FOXO1A and FOXO3A to the longevity phenotype in Han Chinese population. Six tagging SNPs from FOXO1A and FOXO3A were selected and genotyped in 1817 centenarians and younger individuals. Two SNPs of FOXO1A were found to be associated with longevity in women (P = 0.01-0.005), whereas all three SNPs of FOXO3A were associated with longevity in both genders (P = 0.005-0.001). One SNP from FOXO1A was found not to be associated with longevity. In haplotype association tests, the OR (95% CI) for haplotypes TTG and CCG of FOXO1A in association with female longevity were 0.72 (0.58-0.90) and 1.38 (1.08-1.76), P = 0.0033 and 0.0063, respectively. The haplotypes of FOXO3A were associated with longevity in men [GTC: OR (95% CI) = 0.67 (0.51-0.86), P = 0.0014; CGT: OR (95% CI) = 1.48 (1.12-1.94), P = 0.0035] and in women [GTC: OR (95% CI) = 0.75 (0.60-0.94), P = 0.0094; CGT: OR (95% CI) = 1.47 (1.16-1.86), P = 0.0009]. The haplotype association tests were validated by permutation analysis. The association of FOXO1A with female longevity was replicated in 700 centenarians and younger individuals that were sampled geographically different from the original population. Thus, we demonstrate that, unlike FOXO3A, FOXO1A is more closely associated with human female longevity, suggesting that the genetic contribution to longevity trait may be affected by genders."

However, it remains to be verified if rs2470152 is the sole determinant accounting for the association. We determined whether 2 CYP19A1 SNPs tagging different haploblocks (rs2470152 and rs2899470) are associated with sex steroid levels in Chinese men."
19782713,19782713,Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 -2518 A/G single nucleotide polymorphism in Chinese Han patients with ocular Behçet's disease.,"Recent studies in Caucasian uveitis patients have shown an association with the -2518 A/G polymorphism of the monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 gene. It is unknown whether this polymorphism is also associated with ocular Behçet's disease (BD) in Chinese populations. The aim of the current study was therefore to investigate the possible involvement of MCP-1 in the susceptibility to ocular BD in Chinese Han individuals. A case control association study was performed in 296 ocular BD patients and 319 geographically and age-matched healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Binary logistic regression analysis revealed a decreased frequency of the homozygous AA genotype and an increased frequency of AG genotype of the MCP-1 -2518 polymorphism in ocular BD patients compared with healthy controls, when adjusted for gender (p = 0.048, p = 0.028, respectively). However, when segregated on the basis of several clinical findings, no any association was found between this polymorphism and ocular BD. In conclusion, the present study suggests that the MCP-1 -2518 AA genotype seems to display a protective association with ocular BD, whereas the -2518 AG genotype might be a susceptible factor for ocular BD in the Chinese Han population."
19778566,19778566,+49G > A polymorphism in the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 gene increases susceptibility to hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma in a male Chinese population.,"Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is an important regulator and functions negatively in immune response. Its nonsynonymous polymorphism +49G > A (dbSNP: rs231775) has been linked to an elevated risk of T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and even carcinomas. Here, we examined the genotypes at rs231775 of 1003 subjects in a Han Chinese population to detect the association between this single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) susceptibility, including 375 HBV-related HCC patients, 209 non-HCC patients with HBV infection, and 419 healthy controls. Our results indicated a weak trend for the relationship between rs231775 and HBV-related HCC susceptibility, although the statistical level was not significant. However, a significant difference was identified in males between HBV-related HCC patients and healthy controls. The data revealed that the frequency of the A/A genotype was higher in patients compared with healthy controls (odds ratio [OR] = 1.79, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.05-3.08). The G allele appeared to have a protective effect in developing HBV-related HCC. Subjects with the A allele had higher HCC susceptibility than those with the G allele (OR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.03-1.66). These results suggested that the A/A genotype and A allele of rs231775 increased the risk of developing HBV-related HCC in a male Chinese population."

The exact pathogenesis of SLE is still unknown. Recently, several genome-wide association studies (GWA) in European population have found many novel susceptibility genes for SLE including TNFAIP3. In order to examine whether TNFAIP3 is associated with SLE in Chinese Han population, we genotyped one of its non-synonymous mutation SNP rs2230926, showing significant association evidence with SLE in European population, with 1,420 cases and 4,461 controls of Chinese Han by using Sequenom MassArray system. Highly significant association between SNP rs2230926 and SLE of Chinese Han was detected [OR = 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.392-1.986, P = 2.03 x 10(-8)]. Interestingly, rs2230926 of TNFAIP3 was also associated with arthritis, ANA and some other subphenotypes of the disease. Our findings suggest that SNP rs2230926 in the TNFAIP3 might be a common genetic factor for SLE within different populations in terms of Chinese Han and European population."
19813023,19813023,An intronic polymorphism in the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2 gene increases susceptibility to HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma in Chinese population.,"Corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2 (CRHR2) plays a role in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system. CRHR2 together with its ligands, urocortins (Ucns) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), functions as a mediator of inflammatory response and inhibitor of angiogenesis. Recently, it has been reported to be expressed in many human cancers. An association between rs2267716 polymorphism in the CRHR2 gene and susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was found in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In the present study we analyzed, using a polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR), the rs2267716 polymorphism in 364 hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients, 196 non-HCC patients with HBV infection, and 404 healthy controls. The aim was to detect the possible association of this single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with susceptibility to HBV-related HCC. Significant differences of rs2267716 allele were detected between HBV-related HCC patients and healthy controls (OR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.13-2.15, P = 0.007) or non-HCC patients with HBV infection (OR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.13-2.31, P = 0.009). These results suggest that the rs2267716 polymorphism in the CRHR2 gene might influence the risk of developing HCC in patients with HBV infection in Chinese population."
19762325,19762325,XRCC1 codon 280 and ERCC2 codon 751 polymorphisms and risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in a Chinese population.,"Numerous candidate genes have been proposed as susceptibility factors for the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). XRCC1 (X-ray cross-complementing group 1) codon 280 and ERCC2 (excision repair cross complementing group 2) codon 751 polymorphisms were studied in ESCC in a Chinese population. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of XRCC1 codon 280 His and ERCC2 codon 751 Gln polymorphisms and ESCC. Peripheral blood samples of 200 cases and 200 age-and-gender matching controls were collected from a Chinese population and the two polymorphisms were studied by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques. Our results showed that XRCC1 codon 280 His allele had no significant difference between ESCC patients and normal controls (P > 0.05), while ERCC2 codon 751Gln allele was associated with a borderline decrease of ESCC (odds ratio [OR] = 0.628, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.400-0.986)."

Much evidence suggests that the rs3737787 polymorphism in the USF1 gene may lead to alteration of lipid metabolism. The objective of this study was to test the association between rs3737787 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its related lipid metabolic traits in the Chinese population. A total of 287 eligible T2DM families were chosen in Beijing. A set of questionnaires was administered to obtain information on demographic characteristics. Physical measurements were recorded. DNA was extracted from blood samples and genotyped using PCR-RFLP method. Statistical analyses including linkage analysis and family-based association test were performed to detect the relationship between rs3737787 and T2DM related traits. In the non-parametric linkage analysis, it was observed that rs3737787 is potentially linked with triglyceride and apolipoprotein E levels, where the logarithm of the odds scores were 0.87 (p=0.02) and 1.96 (p=0.001), respectively. Similar results were obtained in the multi-factorial generalized estimating equation analysis. Using different statistical approaches, in this study, we have confirmed that the single nucleotide polymorphism rs3737787 is related to triglyceride and apolipoprotein E levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus families."

19707791,19707791,Assessment of association of rs2200733 on chromosome 4q25 with atrial fibrillation and ischemic stroke in a Chinese Han population.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in the clinical setting and an independent risk factor for stroke. Approximately 10 million Chinese people are affected by AF, but the genetic basis is largely unknown. A recent genome-wide association study in Iceland identified association between SNP rs2200733 on 4q25 and AF; however, many independent replication studies are essential to unequivocally validate this association. To assess the association between rs2200733 and AF as well as that between rs2200733 and ischemic stroke in a mainland Chinese Han population, we carried out case-control association studies with 383 AF patients versus 851 non-AF controls and 811 ischemic stroke patients versus 688 non-stroke controls. Highly significant association was detected between rs2200733 and AF in a Chinese Han population (allelic P = 3.7 × 10(-11) with OR = 1.81; genotypic P = 4.1 × 10(-12) with a dominant model). When the AF cases were divided into lone AF (32.6%) and other types of AF (67.4%), significantly stronger association was found with lone AF (OR = 2.40, P = 1.3 × 10(-9) compared to OR = 1.59, P = 6.2 × 10(-7) for other types of AF; P = 0.02 for two ORs). No significant association was found between rs2200733 and ischemic stroke. Our results suggest that SNP rs2200733 confers a highly significant risk of AF, but not ischemic stroke, in a more representative Chinese Han population in the mainland China."

19696228,19696228,Association between heme oxygenase-1 gene promoter polymorphisms and type 2 diabetes in a Chinese population.,"The authors aimed to determine whether 2 functional polymorphisms in the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene promoter are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A Chinese case-control study involving 1,103 newly diagnosed T2DM patients, 371 patients with impaired glucose regulation (IGR), and 1,615 controls was performed (December 2004-December 2007). A (GT)(n) microsatellite polymorphism and a single nucleotide polymorphism, T(-413)A, were genotyped, and their functional relevance was evaluated by examining the level of HO-1 protein expression. For the (GT)(n) microsatellite polymorphism, genotypes with the L (GT)(n) allele (>or=25 GT repeats) were associated with increased odds of IGR or T2DM compared with the S/S genotype (<25 GT repeats) (S/L genotype: odds ratio (OR) = 1.35, P = 0.048; L/L genotype: OR = 1.65, P = 0.006). Subsequent haplotype analysis showed that haplotype TL contributed to increased odds of IGR or T2DM compared with haplotype TS (OR = 1.56, P = 0.003). In functional analyses, HO-1 expression level was significantly reduced in persons with IGR and T2DM carrying the L/L (GT)(n) genotype compared with persons with the S/S genotype. Further haplotype combination assay confirmed the functional dominance of the (GT)(n) microsatellite polymorphism over the T(-413)A single nucleotide polymorphism. These results support an association between the HO-1 (GT)(n) microsatellite polymorphism, HO-1 expression levels, and the odds of T2DM."

To investigate whether the Lf gene is associated with mastitis in dairy cattle, a DNA sequencing approach was used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene. Three previously reported SNPs in the 5' flanking region and one novel SNP in exon1 of Lf gene were identified. A total of 353 individuals from Holstein cattle populations were genotyped for their SNPs using Created Restriction Site PCR (CRS-PCR) and PCR-RFLP methods. Twenty-two and nineteen combinations of three SNPs (g.3440T>G, g.3879_3880insG, and g.4432T>C) and another three SNPs (g.3429G>A, g.3440T>G, g.3879_3880insG) were observed, respectively. The result of haplotype analysis of four SNPs showed that fourteen different haplotypes were identified. Two major haplotypes (GECB and GECA) occurred with a frequency of 22.5 and 18.5% in the study population, respectively. Statistical analyses revealed no significant association between one single SNP of Lf gene and SCS, whereas significant associations between their combined genotypes of three SNPs, haplotype and SCS. Combined genotype EFCDBB and GGEFDD with the lowest SCS were favorable for the mastitis resistance. They may be used as a possible candidate for marker-assisted selection in dairy cattle breeding program."
19696477,19696477,DNMT3B 579G>T promoter polymorphism and the risk for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in a Chinese population.,"Epigenetics may influence the expression of numerous genes, which might contribute to autoimmune diseases. DNA methylation is mediated by DNA methyltransferases, especially DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B). Polymorphisms of the DNMT3B gene may influence DNMT3B activity on DNA methylation and increase the susceptibility to several diseases. The current study investigated the association between DNMT3B 579G>T and the risk for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The DNMT3B 579G>T polymorphisms were analyzed by PCR-RFLP. There was no significant difference in genotype and allele distribution between the ITP patient and the controls (p = 0.722 and 0.667, respectively). Similar results were observed between the 2 groups when stratified by age and disease course, including acute in childhood, chronic in childhood, acute in adult and chronic in adult. Importantly, this study showed a statistical difference in the distribution of SNP of DNMT3B between Chinese and Koreans or Americans. It is shown that the SNP of DNMT3B 579G>T may not be used on its own as a marker to predict the susceptibility to ITP in a Chinese population and that DNMT3B 579G>T promoter SNP varies from one ethnic population to another."

19634821,19634821,Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and the single-nucleotide polymorphism of the growth hormone receptor and IGF-1 genes.,"The etiology of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is undetermined despite years of research. A number of hypotheses have been postulated to explain its development, including growth abnormalities. The irregular expression of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) may disturb hormone metabolism, result in a gross asymmetry, and promote the progress of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Initial association studies in complex diseases have demonstrated the power of candidate gene association. Prior to our study, 1 study in this field had a negative result. A replicable study is vital for reliability. To determine the relationship of growth hormone receptor and IGF-1 genes with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, a population-based association study was performed. Single nucleotide polymorphisms with potential function were selected from candidate genes and a distribution analysis was performed. A conclusion was made confirming the insufficiency of an association between adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and the single-nucleotide polymorphism of the growth hormone receptor and IGF-1 genes in Han Chinese."

19634110,19634110,No association between EGF +61 A/G polymorphism and increased risk of glioma.,"A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) gene +61 A/G in the 5'-untranslated region has been reported to be associated with susceptibility to glioma. A case-control study (168 glioma patients and 194 normal controls) was conducted to elucidate its possible association with the risk of glioma in the Chinese population. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay was used to analyze the EGF genotypes. The genotyping results were further confirmed by direct sequencing. The EGF +61A and +61G allele frequencies in the glioma group were 32.1% and 67.9%, respectively, while they were 30.4% and 69.6% in the healthy controls. Furthermore, the frequency of the A/A, A/G and G/G genotypes in glioma patients was 8.9%, 46.4%, and 44.7%, respectively, and 8.3%, 44.3%, and 47.4% in controls. There was no significant difference between patients and healthy controls. The EGF +61 A/G and +61 G/G genotypes were not significantly associated with risk of glioma compared with the A/A genotype. In addition, no significant association was observed between EGF polymorphism and different histological grades of glioma. These results indicate that the EGF +61 A/G polymorphism is not associated with susceptibility to glioma in the Chinese population. In addition, a literature review revealed a significantly higher rate of the A/A genotype in Caucasian compared with East Asian subjects. Such differences in genotype distribution between Caucasian and Asian people should be taken into account in future studies."
19629745,19629745,Effects of genetic variability of the caprine homeobox transcription factor HESX1 gene on performance traits.,"HESX1 plays a key role in the development of the forebrain and pituitary gland and produces potential effects on performance traits. The objective of this study was to detect and assess the associations of the possible polymorphisms of six loci within HESX1 gene with performance traits in Chinese 1,119 goats. Only one novel SNP (NM_001494116:g.307049A > G) locating on IVS1 + 348A > G was identified and detected by HaeIII forced-RFLP-PCR. The frequencies of allele ""G"" varied from 0.025 to 0.245 in analyzed populations with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P > 0.05). Genotypic and allelic frequencies were found to be significantly different in four breeds (chi(2) = 147.674, df = 6, P < 0.001; chi(2) = 157.250, df = 3, P < 0.001, respectively), implying that the distribution of genotypic and allelic frequencies of goat HESX1 gene was significantly associated with different goat utilities (cashmere, meat and dairy). Association analysis results revealed no significant effects of caprine HESX1 gene on body sizes in XNSN population (P > 0.05) and cashmere traits in IMWC population (P > 0.05). Significant statistical of HESX1 gene with body weight was found (*P < 0.05). The genotype AA showed significantly higher body weight than those of AG in 2-year-old age (*P < 0.05), while the AA genotype was senior to AG genotype in 4-year-old body weight trait (*P < 0.05). These suggestions indicated that the HESX1 gene has significant effect on goat body weight depending on ages, which is accordance with the function repressor of the HESX1."
19626461,19626461,Association of the DNMT3B polymorphism with colorectal adenomatous polyps and adenocarcinoma.,"DNMT3B is an important enzyme to modulate the methylation status in mammalian cells. The aim of this study is to investigate the correlation of the DNMT3B G39179T polymorphism with the susceptibilities of colorectal adenomatous polyps and adenocarcinoma. This case-control study included 146 colorectal adenomatous polyps, 170 colorectal adenocarcinoma patients, and 157 normal controls. DNMT3B polymorphism was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Family history of colorectal cancer significantly increases the risk of developing colorectal adenomatous polyps and adenocarcinoma. The genotype frequency of DNMT3B polymorphism (T/T and G/T + G/G) in adenocarcinoma patients was significantly different from that in controls (P value = 0.01). Compared with DNMT3B T/T genotype, the G allelotype (G/T + G/G genotype) had lower risk to develop colorectal adenocarcinoma (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.29-0.87); while there was no significant difference between the colorectal adenomatous polyps patients and controls (OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.37-1.09), although descending tendency could be found in this polyps group. In the stratification analysis, a significant association was confined to subgroups of age < 55 (OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.12-0.84) and males (OR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.17-0.71). Meanwhile, combined G/T + G/G genotypes were found to have a lower risk in non-drinkers to develop both colorectal adenomatous polyps and adenocarcinoma (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.31-0.96 and OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.27-0.84, respectively). This study also showed a distinct difference in the distribution of DNMT3B G39179T SNP in different ethnics. DNMT3B G39179T SNP may be a potential genetic susceptibility factor for adenocarcinoma of the colon, especially in younger Chinese Han non-drinker men."

It is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. CD40 signaling has been linked to pathogenic processes of chronic inflammatory diseases. After interaction with its ligand CD154 (CD40L), CD40 induces a broad variety of chronic inflammatory responses, inducing the release of inflammatory mediators. We investigated whether a CD40 gene (-1C/T) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with COPD in a Chinese population."

19543209,19543209,The associations of LPIN1 gene expression in adipose tissue with metabolic phenotypes in the Chinese population.,"The LPIN1 gene, encoding lipin-1 protein, plays critical roles in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism. This study aimed to analyze the association of LPIN1 mRNA levels in human adipose tissue with metabolic phenotypes. We also examined the association of LPIN1 genetic variation with type 2 diabetes and related metabolic phenotypes in the Chinese population. The relative LPIN1 mRNA levels were measured in abdominal visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) obtained from 102 nondiabetic Chinese females. Seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning from the 5'-upstream region to the 3'-end of the LPIN1 gene were genotyped in 1,520 Chinese (760 type 2 diabetic cases and 760 controls). LPIN1 mRNA levels in VAT were negatively correlated with BMI (r = -0.21, P = 0.03), body fat percentage (r = -0.22, P = 0.02), plasma triglycerides levels (r = -0.21, P = 0.03), and plasma leptin levels (r = -0.63, P = 0.0002). LPIN1 mRNA levels were positively correlated with PPARG and ADIPOQ mRNA levels in both VAT and SAT. No single SNP of the LPIN1 gene was associated with type 2 diabetes in our population. One rare haplotype showed a significant association with type 2 diabetes (odds ratio (OR), 4.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.86-11.75; P = 4 x 10(-4)). No SNP or haplotype of the LPIN1 gene was associated with quantitative metabolic traits in the nondiabetic subjects. The results confirmed the association of LPIN1 gene expression in adipose tissue with lower adiposity and favorable metabolic profiles in the Chinese population. However, the LPIN1 gene seemed not to be a major susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes or related metabolic phenotypes in the Chinese population."
19558548,19558548,Genetic variants of C1orf10 and risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in a Chinese population.,"Chromosome 1 open reading frame 10 (C1orf10) is either down-regulated or absent in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues compared to its corresponding normal counterparts, and it is involved in heat shock and ethanol response and is expected to protect esophageal epithelium from damage. In the present study, we sequenced DNA samples from 32 individuals to search for genetic variants in the promoter region, coding region, and the untranslated region of C1orf10. Genotypes were analyzed in 991 patients and 984 controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by logistic regression. Luciferase assays were carried out to find the functional SNPs. Six strongly linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning a region of 7 kb, -1747G/T, -1139G/C, -1079G/A, -900G/T, Gly480Ser, and 4666G/A were identified (D'= 1, r(2 )= 1). Only one SNP -1139G/C was selected to analyze the association between C1orf10 genotypes and risk of ESCC. Subjects with the -1139CC genotype had a greater risk of developing ESCC compared with those with the -1139GG genotype (adjusted OR = 1.34; 95% CI, 1.02-1.76). There appears to be an interaction between the -1139G/C polymorphism and tobacco smoking that contributes to the risk for ESCC. However, we did not detect any obvious difference in reporter gene assay driven by each allele of C1orf10 promoter or 3' UTR. These data showed that C1orf10 haplotypes containing -1747G/T, -1139G/C, -1079G/A, -900G/T, Gly480Ser, and 4666G/A are significantly associated with susceptibility to ESCC."

19594299,19594299,Gene expression profiling in monocytes and SNP association suggest the importance of the STAT1 gene for osteoporosis in both Chinese and Caucasians.,"Osteoporosis is characterized mainly by low bone mineral density (BMD). Many cytokines and chemokines have been related with bone metabolism. Monocytes in the immune system are important sources of cytokines and chemokines for bone metabolism. However, no study has investigated in vivo expression of a large number of various factors simultaneously in human monocytes underlying osteoporosis. This study explored the in vivo expression pattern of general cytokines, chemokines, and their receptor genes in human monocytes and validated the significant genes by qRT-PCR and genetic association analyses. Expression profilings were performed in monocyte samples from 26 Chinese and 20 Caucasian premenopausal women with discordant BMD. Genome-wide association analysis with BMD variation was conducted in 1000 unrelated Caucasians. We selected 168 cytokines, chemokines, osteoclast-related factors, and their receptor genes for analyses. Significantly, the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) gene was upregulated in the low versus the high BMD groups in both Chinese and Caucasians. We also revealed a significant association of the STAT1 gene with BMD variation in the 1000 Caucasians. Thus we conclude that the STAT1 gene is important in human circulating monocytes in the etiology of osteoporosis."
19536152,19536152,"The evolution and diversity of TNF block haplotypes in European, Asian and Australian Aboriginal populations.","The region spanning the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) cluster in the human major histocompatibility complex is implicated in susceptibility to immunopathological disease, but ethnic differences and linkage disequilibrium have hampered identification of critical polymorphisms. Here, we investigate Europeans, Asians (Bidayuh, Chinese, Indian, Jehai, Malay, Temuan) and Australian Aborigines to provide a framework for disease-association studies. DNA from 999 unrelated healthy donors was genotyped at 38 loci, primarily in coding and promoter regions over a 60-kb region spanning seven genes near TNF. The PHASE algorithm was used to statistically infer TNF block haplotypes and estimate their frequencies in each population. The TNF block is carried as 31 haplotypes in all populations combined, with <19 in any single population. Only six haplotypes have a unique tag single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) valid for all populations, but seven haplotypes could be tagged with individual SNPs in selected populations. Four to eight TNF block haplotypes exist across all ethnicities, and hence must pre-date the divergence of these populations from a common ancestor >160,000 years ago. Some haplotypes are unique to isolated populations, but they do not contain unique SNP. Hence, they reflect restricted migration and/or extinction of some families rather than de novo mutation."

We examined associations between germline polymorphisms in 6 genes involved in the steroid hormone metabolism and signaling pathway (COMT, CYP19A1, ESR1, PGR, SULT1E1, STS) and survival among women with breast cancer participating in SEARCH, a population-based case-control study. Blood samples from up to 4,470 women were genotyped for 4 possible functional SNPs in CYP19A1 and 106 SNPs tagging the common variation in the remainder of the genes. The genotypes of each polymorphism were tested for association with survival after breast cancer diagnosis using Cox regression analysis. Significant evidence of an association was observed for a COMT polymorphism (rs4818 p = 0.016) under the codominant model. This SNP appeared to fit a dominant model better (HR = 0.80 95% CI: 0.69-0.95, p = 0.009); however, the result was only marginally significant after permutation analysis adjustment for multiple hypothesis tests (p = 0.047). To further evaluate this finding, somatic expression microarray data from 8 publicly available datasets were used to test the association between survival and tumor COMT gene expression; no statistically significant associations were observed. A correlated SNP in COMT, rs4860, has recently been associated with breast cancer prognosis in Chinese women in a dominant model. These results suggest that COMT rs4818, or a variant it tags, is associated with breast cancer prognosis. Further study of COMT and its putative association with breast cancer prognosis is warranted."
19517237,19517237,DNMT3B promoter polymorphism and risk of gastric cancer.,"To investigate the association of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) gene and the risk of gastric cancer (GC), we detected -149C>T and -579G>T in the promoter region of the DNMT3B gene by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and DNA sequencing analysis. The DNMT3B genotype was determined in 259 gastric cancer patients and 262 healthy controls that were frequency matched for age and gender. Results showed that individuals with at least one -579G allele were also at significantly decreased risk of gastric cancer [odds ratio (OR), 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26-0.72] compared with those having a -579TT genotype. The -149C>T genotype distribution was irrelevant to the risk of gastric cancer (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.17-17.94) in the studied Chinese population. In addition, data suggested that DNMT3B genetic polymorphism varied among different races, ethnic groups, and geographic areas."
19480848,19480848,TAP1 and TAP2 polymorphisms associated with ankylosing spondylitis in genetically homogenous Chinese Han population.,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 is strongly associated with the autoimmune disease ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Other autoimmune disease-associated genes, such as transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) genes, could also influence AS susceptibility. In this study, we investigated the association of TAP1 and TAP2 polymorphisms in genetically homogenous Chinese AS patients. Six TAP1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and three TAP2 SNPs sites were analyzed in B27-positive AS cases, healthy B27-negative controls, and healthy B27-positive controls. In the allele and genotype analysis, the results indicated that TAP1 site 1910 allele G, genotype AG and TAP2 site 1693 genotype AA were associated with increased AS risk in a case-B27 negative control (p < 0.05). In the haplotype analysis, TAP1 SNP haplotype (GGGGGG, TAP1*020101) and TAP1-TAP2 SNP haplotypes (GGGGGG-GGG, TAP1*020101-TAP2*0101, and GGAAGG-GAG, TAP1*0101-TAP2*0102) increased AS risk in case-B27 negative control (p < 0.05). In contrast, TAP1-TAP2 SNP haplotype GGGGGG-GAG (TAP1*020101-TAP2*0102) was less common in cases than in B27-negative controls (p < 0.05). Moreover, TAP1-TAP2 SNP haplotype GGGAGG-GGG (TAP1*0301-TAP2*0101) was less common in cases than in B27-positive controls. The two haplotypes appeared to confer protection in AS (p < 0.05). These results suggest a potential mechanism of altered antigen-peptide selection and transport in AS pathogenesis."

19478819,19478819,A genome-wide association study identifies ITGA9 conferring risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,"To identify a gene(s) susceptible to nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) through genotyping of more than 500,000 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), using an initial sample set of 111 unrelated NPC patients and 260 controls of a Malaysian Chinese population. We further evaluated the top 200 SNPs showing the smallest P-values, using a replication sample set that consisted of 168 cases and 252 controls. The combined analysis of the two sets of samples found an SNP in intron 3 of the ITGA9 (integrin-alpha 9) gene, rs2212020, to be strongly associated with NPC (P=8.27 x 10(-7), odds ratio (OR)=2.24, 95% confidence intervals (CI)=1.59-3.15). The gene is located at 3p21 which is commonly deleted in NPC cells. We subsequently genotyped additional 19 tag SNPs within a 40-kb linkage disequilibrium (LD) block surrounding this landmark SNP. Among them, SNP rs189897 showed the strongest association with a P-value of 6.85 x 10(-8) (OR=3.18, 95% CI=1.94-5.21), suggesting that a genetic variation(s) in ITGA9 may influence susceptibility to NPC in the Malaysian Chinese population."
19494522,19494522,Family-based association study of Tim-1 and Tim-3 gene polymorphisms with childhood asthma in Chinese trios.,"Asthma is a complex genetic disease, caused by the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain (Tim) genes are located in chromosome 5q31-33, a region repeatedly linked to asthma or asthma-related phenotypes in several populations. Two members of Tim families, Tim-1 and Tim-3, which are expressed on T cell surface and potentially involved in T cell proliferation and differentiation, are good candidate genes for asthma. We investigated whether genetic variants or haplotypes in Tim-1 and Tim-3 genes confer susceptibility to asthma in a Chinese population."
19448850,19448850,Positive association between the PDLIM5 gene and bipolar disorder in the Chinese Han population.,"Bipolar disorder is a widespread and severe brain disorder that is strongly affected by genetic factors. The PDZ and LIM domain 5 (PDLIM5) gene encodes a protein as an Enigma homologue LIM domain protein, which has been widely reported as being expressed in various brain regions. The analysis of DNA microarrays in the frontal lobes of patients with bipolar disorder has indicated changes in the expression level of PDLIM5, and subsequent studies have suggested that PDLIM5 might play a role in susceptibility to bipolar disorder. We sought to examine the association between PDLIM5 and bipolar disorder."

19408343,19408343,Lung cancer susceptibility and prognosis associated with polymorphisms in the nonhomologous end-joining pathway genes: a multiple genotype-phenotype study.,"Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) frequently exhibits genomic instability, such as high fractional allelic loss (FAL). Genomic instability may result from unrepaired or misrepaired double-strand breaks (DSBs). The authors of this report postulated that polymorphisms in genes of the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, which is the major DSB repair pathway in mammalian cells, may modulate lung cancer susceptibility and prognosis."

19421330,19421330,Genome-wide association study of young-onset hypertension in the Han Chinese population of Taiwan.,"Young-onset hypertension has a stronger genetic component than late-onset counterpart; thus, the identification of genes related to its susceptibility is a critical issue for the prevention and management of this disease. We carried out a two-stage association scan to map young-onset hypertension susceptibility genes. The first-stage analysis, a genome-wide association study, analyzed 175 matched case-control pairs; the second-stage analysis, a confirmatory association study, verified the results at the first stage based on a total of 1,008 patients and 1,008 controls. Single-locus association tests, multilocus association tests and pair-wise gene-gene interaction tests were performed to identify young-onset hypertension susceptibility genes. After considering stringent adjustments of multiple testing, gene annotation and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) quality, four SNPs from two SNP triplets with strong association signals (-log(10)(p)>7) and 13 SNPs from 8 interactive SNP pairs with strong interactive signals (-log(10)(p)>8) were carefully re-examined. The confirmatory study verified the association for a SNP quartet 219 kb and 495 kb downstream of LOC344371 (a hypothetical gene) and RASGRP3 on chromosome 2p22.3, respectively. The latter has been implicated in the abnormal vascular responsiveness to endothelin-1 and angiotensin II in diabetic-hypertensive rats. Intrinsic synergy involving IMPG1 on chromosome 6q14.2-q15 was also verified. IMPG1 encodes interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan 1 which has cation binding capacity. The genes are novel hypertension targets identified in this first genome-wide hypertension association study of the Han Chinese population."

19371798,19371798,The -9247 T/C polymorphism in the SOST upstream regulatory region that potentially affects C/EBPalpha and FOXA1 binding is associated with osteoporosis.,"Accumulating evidence shows that genes that cause monogenic diseases also contribute to similar complex disease in the general population. We sought to determine whether the allelic variation in seven monogenic bone disease genes (CLCN7, TCIRGI, SOST, CA2, CSTK, TGFB1 and SLC26A2) contributes to osteoporosis/bone mineral density (BMD) variation in the normal Chinese population. We conducted a gene-wide tag SNP-based association study in 1243 Chinese subjects with low BMD (Z-scores < or = -1.28, equivalent to the lowest 10% of the population) and high BMD (Z-score > or = +1.0). Twenty-two tag SNPs were selected and genotyped by using the high-throughput Sequenom genotyping platform. Allelic and haplotype association tests were conducted by Haploview and binary logistic regression analyses. The -9247 polymorphism rs1230399 in the upstream regulatory region of the sclerostin gene showed significant genotypic/allelic associations with spine, femoral neck, trochanter and total hip BMD (P=0.03-0.004). The T-allele of rs1230399 increased the risk of osteoporosis (OR=1.52, P=0.005). Computational analysis showed that rs1230399 is located at the core consensus recognition site of two cooperating transcription factors C/EBPalpha and FOXA1 that modulate estrogen receptor function. T-->C polymorphism abolishes the binding of both C/EBPalpha and FOXA1 to the sclerostin gene. Our data suggest a mechanistic link between rs1230399 and BMD through estrogen ERalpha/FOXA1 signaling pathways driven by long-distance enhancers."
19367581,19367581,Identification of neuroglycan C and interacting partners as potential susceptibility genes for schizophrenia in a Southern Chinese population.,"Chromosome 3p was reported by previous studies as one of the regions showing strong evidence of linkage with schizophrenia. We performed a fine-mapping association study of a 6-Mb high-LD and gene-rich region on 3p in a Southern Chinese sample of 489 schizophrenia patients and 519 controls to search for susceptibility genes. In the initial screen, 4 SNPs out of the 144 tag SNPs genotyped were nominally significant (P < 0.05). One of the most significant SNPs (rs3732530, P = 0.0048) was a non-synonymous SNP in the neuroglycan C (NGC, also known as CSPG5) gene, which belongs to the neuregulin family. The gene prioritization program Endeavor ranked NGC 8th out of the 129 genes in the 6-Mb region and the highest among the genes within the same LD block. Further genotyping of NGC revealed 3 more SNPs to be nominally associated with schizophrenia. Three other genes (NRG1, ErbB3, ErbB4) involved in the neuregulin pathways were subsequently genotyped. Interaction analysis by multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) revealed a significant two-SNP interaction between NGC and NRG1 (P = 0.015) and three-SNP interactions between NRG1 and ErbB4 (P = 0.009). The gene NGC is exclusively expressed in the brain. It is implicated in neurodevelopment in rats and was previously shown to promote neurite outgrowth. Methamphetamine, a drug that may induce psychotic symptoms, was reported to alter the expression of NGC. Taken together, these results suggest that NGC may be a novel candidate gene, and neuregulin signaling pathways may play an important role in schizophrenia."
19387458,19387458,Complement receptor 2 polymorphisms associated with systemic lupus erythematosus modulate alternative splicing.,"Genetic factors influence susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A recent family-based analysis in Caucasian and Chinese populations provided evidence for association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the complement receptor 2 (CR2/CD21) gene with SLE. Here we confirmed this result in a case-control analysis of an independent European-derived population including 2084 patients with SLE and 2853 healthy controls. A haplotype formed by the minor alleles of three CR2 SNPs (rs1048971, rs17615, rs4308977) showed significant association with decreased risk of SLE (30.4% in cases vs 32.6% in controls, P=0.016, OR=0.90 (0.82-0.98)). Two of these SNPs are in exon 10, directly 5' of an alternatively spliced exon preferentially expressed in follicular dendritic cells (FDC), and the third is in the alternatively spliced exon. Effects of these SNPs and a fourth SNP in exon 11 (rs17616) on alternative splicing were evaluated. We found that the minor alleles of these SNPs decreased splicing efficiency of exon 11 both in vitro and ex vivo. These findings further implicate CR2 in the pathogenesis of SLE and suggest that CR2 variants alter the maintenance of tolerance and autoantibody production in the secondary lymphoid tissues where B cells and FDCs interact."
19381781,19381781,Association of -394C>G and -420C>G polymorphisms in the RETN gene with T2DM and CHD and a new potential SNP might be exist in exon 3 of RETN gene in Chinese.,"Genetic variations of the human RETN gene are associated with metabolic phenotypes, including obesity, insulin sensitivity, diabetes, and coronary heart disease (CHD). There are few studies of two gene variants, -394C>G and -420C>G, in Chinese population. This study investigated the distribution of RETN gene, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in Chinese Han population and the association of the polymorphisms with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and CHD. In a population-based, case-control genetic association study, a total of 961 subjects were recruited from the community, including 318 T2DM patients, 273 CHD patients, and 370 unrelated healthy control individuals. Serum lipid levels were detected. Two SNPs of RETN gene, -394C>G and -420C>G, were genotyped by PCR-RFLP. Unknown Polymorphisms were screened with the technique of denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). The frequencies of RETN -394G allele in T2DM group, CHD group, and control group were 0.3066, 0.3555, and 0.3481, respectively, which are met with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There is a significant difference of the comparison of sex in T2DM group of RETN gene SNP-394C>G (P < 0.05). Compared with controls, there was no significant difference in the distribution of genotypes and allele frequencies of -394C>G polymorphic site in T2DM patients and CHD patients, respectively. No direct association was found between the -394C>G polymorphism and T2DM or CHD. The frequencies of RETN -420G allele in T2DM group, CHD group, and control group were 0.4009, 0.3725, and 0.3859, respectively, which are met with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The frequencies of RETN -420G allele in T2DM groups and control groups of Chinese population are significantly different from those in European population (0.40 vs. 0.27, 0.39 vs. 0.26) (P < 0.01). Compared with controls, there was no significant difference in distribution of genotypes and allele frequencies of -420C>G polymorphic site in T2DM patients and CHD patients, respectively. No direct association was found between the -420C>G polymorphism and T2DM or CHD. In addition, we found new potential SNP +593G>C in exon 3 of RETN gene using DHPLC. The RETN gene exhibits sex and ethnic differences. +593G>C of RETN gene might be a new potential SNP in exon 3 of RETN gene. Association between SNP -394C>G and -420C>G of RETN gene with T2DM and CHD in Chinese needs more exploration."

19337058,19337058,CD14-159C/T and TLR9-1237T/C polymorphisms are not associated with gastric cancer risk in Caucasian populations.,"Host genetic factors play an important role in modifying the risk of human disease, including cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract, with increasing interest in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and the impact of genetic polymorphisms in these systems. The CD14-159C/T and the TLR9-1237T/C promoter polymorphisms have previously been shown to be associated with various inflammatory conditions including Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis in Caucasian populations. In this study, we assessed the association of these two functional single nucleotide polymorphisms with gastric cancer in two independent Caucasian population-based case-control studies of upper gastrointestinal tract cancer, initially in 312 noncardia gastric carcinoma cases and 419 controls and then in 184 noncardia gastric carcinomas, 123 cardia carcinomas, 159 esophageal cancers, and 211 frequency-matched controls. Odds ratios were computed from logistic models and adjusted for potential confounding factors. No significant association was found between the CD14-159C/T and the TLR9-1237T/C promoter polymorphisms and increased risk of gastric cancer. Neither single nucleotide polymorphism has been assessed in a Caucasian gastric cancer case-control study before; although the CD14-159C/T polymorphism has been reported to show no apparent association with H. pylori-related gastric malignancy in a Taiwanese Chinese population. In conclusion, although our earlier preliminary studies suggested that the CD14-159C/T and the TLR9-1237T/C promoter polymorphisms increase the risk of precancerous outcomes, they do not seem to increase the risk of gastric cancer itself. This discrepancy merits further examination."
19335080,19335080,Association between vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms and severe chronic periodontitis in a Chinese population.,"Chronic periodontitis (CP) exhibits inflammation and alveolar bone loss, and severe forms of periodontitis are suggested to have a genetic basis. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) regulates bone metabolism and inflammation-related genes, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the VDR gene may affect the functional activity of the VDR protein in CP. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between VDR SNPs and severe CP in a Chinese population."

19339914,19339914,First evidence of association between G72 and bipolar disorder in the Chinese Han population.,"The G72/G30 (D-amino-acid oxidase activator) complex was the first gene to be associated with bipolar disorder (BPD) in European populations, but until now no such association has been identified in Asian populations. To investigate possible association in the Chinese Han population, we carried out a study involving 475 BPD patients and 588 healthy controls. The results provide first evidence for the single nucleotide polymorphism rs778293 in G72 as a potential candidate in altering risk for BPD in the Chinese Han population."
19317742,19317742,Interleukin-23 receptor gene polymorphisms is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy in Chinese Han population.,"Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by ventricular chamber enlargement and systolic dysfunction with normal left ventricular wall thickness. The pathogenesis of DCM has been extensively investigated for many years, but it remains uncertain. Recently, many studies indicated that autoimmune mechanisms are likely to participate in the pathogenesis of DCM. Interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R) gene polymorphisms have been previously found to be associated with autoimmune diseases. To assess the role of IL-23R in DCM, we examined three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL-23R gene, namely, rs1884444, rs11465817 and rs10889677. A total of 176 DCM patients and 216 controls were included in the study, and all SNPs were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Our results showed that SNP rs10889677, but not rs1884444 and rs11465817, had association with DCM in Chinese Han population. The results suggest that IL-23R polymorphisms appear to play an important role in the susceptibility of DCM in Chinese Han population."

19299407,19299407,Replication of genetic associations with plasma lipoprotein traits in a multiethnic sample.,"Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reproducibly identified loci associated with plasma triglycerides (TG), HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol. We sought to replicate these findings in a multiethnic population-based cohort using the curated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) set found on the new Illumina cardiovascular disease (CVD) beadchip, which contains approximately 50,000 SNPs densely mapping approximately 2,100 genes, selected based on their potential role in CVD. The sample consisted of individuals with European (n = 272), South Asian (n = 330), and Chinese (n = 304) ancestry. Identity by state clustering successfully classified individuals according to self-reported ethnicities. Associations between TG and APOA5, TG and LPL, HDL and CETP, and LDL and APOE were all identified (P < 2 x 10(-6)). In 13 loci, associations with the same SNP or a proxy SNP were identified in the same direction as previously reported (P < 0.05). Assessing the cumulative number of risk-associated alleles at multiple replicated SNPs increased the proportion of explained lipoprotein variance over and above traditional variables such as age, sex, body mass index, and ethnicity. The findings indicate the potential utility of the Illumina CVD beadchip, but they underscore the need to consider meta-analysis of results from commonly studied clinical or epidemiological samples."
19287041,19287041,RBP4 variants are significantly associated with plasma RBP4 levels and hypertriglyceridemia risk in Chinese Hans.,"We previously found that plasma RBP4 levels were strongly associated with metabolic syndrome components. This study aimed to determine whether RBP4 variants are associated with the metabolic syndrome components and plasma RBP4 levels, and to investigate whether the associations between plasma RBP4 and the metabolic syndrome components are causal. Five tagSNPs were tested for their associations with plasma RBP4 levels and metabolic syndrome components in a population-based sample of 3,210 Chinese Hans. A possible causal relationship between plasma RBP4 levels and hypertriglyceridemia was explored by Mendelian randomization. Plasma RBP4 levels were significantly associated with rs10882273 (betaz -0.10SD[-0.17, -0.03], P = 0.0050), rs3758538 (betaz -0.13SD[-0.24, -0.02], P = 0.0249) in all participants, and with rs17108993 in Shanghai participants (betaz -0.19SD[-0.32, -0.05], P = 0.0061). The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3758538 was significantly associated with hypertriglyceridemia (OR 0.62[0.45-0.85], P = 0.0026) and triglycerides (betaz -0.19SD[-0.30, -0.07], P = 0.001) in all participants. In Mendelian randomization analysis, the observed effect size of association between rs3758538 and hypertriglyceridemia was different from the expected effect size (P = 0.0213). This is the first study to show that the RBP4 variants are significantly associated with plasma RBP4 levels and hypertriglyceridemia risk in Chinese Hans. However, results of Mendelian randomization do not support the hypothesis that RBP4 levels are causally related to hypertriglyceridemia risk."
19272601,19272601,The functional variant rs1048990 in PSMA6 is associated with susceptibility to myocardial infarction in a Chinese population.,"A recent case-control study reported that a functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the proteasome subunit alpha type 6 gene (PSMA6) (rs1048990, C/G) was associated with susceptibility to myocardial infarction (MI) in the Japanese population. Replication studies have been performed in European and other Japanese study samples, but the results were not conclusive. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether this locus confers significant susceptibility to MI in a Chinese population. We conducted a case-control association study on a cohort of 1884 MI patients and 2643 unrelated controls from the Chinese population. Genotyping of the rs1048990 SNP was performed by the Allele-specific Real Time PCR method. We found that rs1048990 was significantly associated with MI (adjusted for age and sex, odds ratio 1.22, p=0.000005, allele frequency model; odds ratio 1.44, p=0.0000025; recessive model; odds ratio 1.56, p=0.00000048, additive model). A meta-analysis yielded a combined OR for MI of 1.15 (95% CI: 1.11-1.21) with an allele frequency model, 1.37 (95% CI: 1.23-1.51) with a recessive model and 1.44 (95% CI: 1.29-1.60) with an additive model. There was no relationship between rs1048990 and age, sex or other conventional cardiovascular risk factors. Our results indicate that the PSMA6 variant rs1048990 is a risk factor of myocardial infarction in the Chinese population."

Recently, we conducted a survey of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in miRNA sequences and reported that, among four SNPs (rs2910164, rs2292832, rs11614913, and rs3746444) in pre-miRNAs, rs11614913 in miR-196a2 might affect mature miR-196a expression and target mRNA-binding activity and was significantly associated with non-small cell lung cancer survival. However, it remains largely unknown whether miRNA SNPs may alter lung cancer susceptibility. In the current study, we evaluated associations between the above four SNPs in pre-miRNAs and lung cancer susceptibility in a case-control study of 1,058 incident lung cancer patients and 1,035 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population. We found that miR-196a2 rs11614913 variant homozygote CC was associated with approximately 25% significantly increased risk of lung cancer compared with their wild-type homozygote TT and heterozygote TC (odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.54). However, no significant effects were observed on the association between the other three SNPs and lung cancer risk. These findings suggest that functional SNP rs11614913 in miR-196a2 could also contribute to lung cancer susceptibility."
19282817,19282817,A study on polymorphisms of elastin gene in Chinese Han patients with isolated systolic hypertension.,"Elastin (ELN) is mainly located in the internal elastic lamina of large arteries. Degradation of ELN is expected to induce large vessel stiffness, which could lead to elderly systolic hypertension. Recent studies have shown that polymorphism of ELN is associated with stiffness of elastic arteries and elevated blood pressure; however, there are no further studies on isolated systolic hypertension (ISH)."
19262575,19262575,Polymorphisms in the interleukin 3 gene show strong association with susceptibility to Graves' disease in Chinese population.,"Graves' disease (GD) is a common organ-specific autoimmune disorder, which is multifactorial and develops in genetically susceptible individuals. We had earlier mapped a susceptibility locus for GD to chromosome 5q31-33 in a linkage study. Here we used tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to search for genetic variants associated with GD, and examined 19 functional candidate genes in this chromosomal region. We identified 192 polymorphisms by re-sequencing the candidate genes, and selected 51 tagSNPs to genotype in a case-control collection of 1118 south Han Chinese subjects (428 cases and 690 controls). Initial analysis suggested that a non-synonymous SNP rs40401 (P27S) of interleukin 3 (IL3) was associated with GD, and further fine-mapping showed that rs40401, or its perfect proxy SNP rs31480 in the 5' flanking region of IL3, fully accounted for the association signal at this locus. We replicated significant association of rs40401 with GD in an independent sample collection of 839 north Han Chinese subjects. A combined analysis revealed strong validation of this association (odds ratio (OR(common))=1.63, combined P (P(comb))=4 x 10(-6) in the Recessive disease model). This study provides convincing evidence that the IL3 gene is a susceptibility locus for GD in the Chinese population."

19250061,19250061,Common genetic variation in DDAH2 is associated with intracerebral haemorrhage in a Chinese population: a multi-centre case-control study in China.,"ADMA (asymmetric omega-NG,NG-dimethylarginine), an endogenous inhibitor of NOS (NO synthase), has been shown to be an independent predictor of cerebrovascular disorders. DDAH2 (dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 2) promotes the metabolism of ADMA and plays a key role in the regulation of the acute inflammatory response. We hypothesized that genetic variation in DDAH2 might alter the susceptibility to ICH (intracerebral haemorrhage). The hypothesis was tested in two independent case-control studies. We used a haplotype-tagging SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) approach to identify tag SNPs in DDAH2. The SNPs were genotyped in 1603 stroke patients and 1525 control subjects. The study was replicated in another independent case-control study including 322 stroke patients and 891 control subjects. A promoter variant -449C/G (rs805305) in DDAH2 was identified and found to be in complete linkage disequilibrium with the only tag SNP (rs707916) in the region containing DDAH2. Genotype analyses were conducted for both dominant and additive models. The C allele of the -449 locus resulted in a significantly reduced risk of ICH {dominant model: OR (odds ratio), 0.51 [95% CI (confidence interval), 0.38-0.68], P=6.60x10-6; additive model: OR, 0.64 (95% CI, 0.52-0.80), P=5.21x10-5} than the wild-type genotype. No association was observed between the DDAH2 variant and atherothrombotic stroke. The findings were replicated in the second independent population. In conclusion, our results suggest that the DDAH2 common variant may play a protective role in the development of ICH, implicating that the DDAH2/ADMA pathway may act as a critical regulator of cerebral small-vessel disorders."

This study investigated the genetic variants of four bilirubin metabolism genes--heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), biliverdin reductase A (BLVRA), solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1), and uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1)--in relation to TBIL levels and CAD."
19225211,19225211,Polymorphism of DsbA-L gene associates with insulin secretion and body fat distribution in Chinese population.,"Disulfide-bond-A oxidoreductase-like protein (DsbA-L) has been suggested to take part in the disulfide bond formation progress of proteins, including insulin and adiponectin. Recent study has demonstrated that expression of DsbA-L was decreased in obese mice and human subject, indicating that DsbA-L might be a potential target for treatment of metabolic diseases. We investigated the association of SNP-1308G/T (rs1917760) of DsbA-L gene with metabolic diseases. 589 normal glucose tolerance (NGT) subjects and 556 type 2 diabetes (T2DM) subjects were recruited. Each group was divided into normal weight (NW) (BMI<24 kg/m(2)) subgroup and overweight/obesity (OW/OB) (BMI>/=24 kg/ m(2)) subgroup. Genotype distributions and allele frequencies of SNP (-1308G/T) in DsbA-L gene were not associated with T2DM and obesity. However, it was observed that T allele carriers had better insulin secretion function compared with non-T allele carriers in NGT-NW group, not only the first phase insulin secretion (P=0.007) but also the second phase insulin secretion (P=0.031). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that SNP-1308G/T polymorphism (rs1917760) was independently correlated with both first and second phase insulin secretion in NGT-NW group (R(2)=0.055, P=0.007; R(2)=0.029, P=0.041). Otherwise, T carriers had more visceral fat than non-T carriers (P=0.020) in NGT-OW/OB group. In conclusion, the SNP-1308G/T (rs1917760) genotypes of DsbA-L gene might participate in insulin secretion and body fat distribution. It is possible that polymorphisms of DsbA-L gene associated with metabolic diseases."

19189208,19189208,Genetic variation and association of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 with performance in Swine.,"Genetic variation of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 was analyzed in 17 pig breeds (14 native Chinese and 3 European). Using PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism, we found a polymorphism in intron 2, and this SNP was the combined mutation of G897T-G903A-C911T. The Chinese breeds carried a higher TAT/TAT genotype frequency (over 50%), except for Bamei (22%), Yujiang Black (0.0%), and Erhualian (10.0%); the European breeds had a higher GGC/GGC genotype frequency (Large White 1.67%, Landrace 13.89%, Duroc 0.0%). The allelic frequency of TAT in Chinese breeds was over 50%, except for Yujiang Black (12.5%); the allelic frequency of GGC was over 50% in all European breeds. The effect of genotype on 43 performance traits was investigated in one population (Lantang x Landrace). Pigs with the TAT/TAT genotype had higher B-point and C-point back-fat thickness than pigs with the GGC/GGC genotype. The TAT/TAT pigs also scored higher in meat color than the GGC/GGC pigs. These results implied that IGFBP-3 may affect meat quality and carcass traits."
19190136,19190136,Association of thymidylate synthase gene with endometrial cancer risk in a Chinese population.,"We comprehensively evaluated genetic variants in the thymidylate synthase (TYMS) gene in association with endometrial cancer risk in a population-based case-control study of 1,199 incident endometrial cancer cases and 1,212 age frequency-matched population controls. Exposure information was obtained via in-person interview, and DNA samples (blood or buccal cell) were collected. Genotyping of 11 haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) for the TYMS gene plus the 5-kb flanking regions was done for 1,028 cases and 1,003 controls by using the Affymetrix MegAllele Targeted Genotyping System. Of 11 haplotype-tagging SNPs identified, 7 that are located in flanking regions of the TYMS gene are also in the ENOSF1 (rTS) gene. The SNP rs3819102, located in the 3'-flanking region of the TYMS gene and in an intron of the ENOSF1 gene, was associated with risk of endometrial cancer. The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the CC genotype was 1.5 (1.0-2.2) compared with the TT genotype. Haplotype TTG in block 2 of the TYMS gene, which includes SNPs rs10502289, rs2298583, and rs2298581 (located in introns of the ENOSF1 gene), was associated with a marginally significant decrease in risk of endometrial cancer under the dominant model (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.6-1.0). This study suggests that genetic polymorphisms in the TYMS or ENOSF1 genes may play a role in the development of endometrial cancer among Chinese women."

19130296,19130296,Association study of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the exon 2 region of toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) gene with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus among Chinese.,"Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) plays an important role in the induction and regulation of the innate immune system or adaptive immune responses. Genetic variations within human TLR9 have been reported to be associated with a range of immune-related diseases, such as asthma, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and so on. Family-based association analysis was performed to further investigate whether a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs352140) in the exon 2 region of TLR9 gene is associated with susceptibility to SLE in a Chinese population. A total of 77 patients with SLE from 74 nuclear families, aged from 12 to 63 years, were enrolled according to 1997 criteria of American College of Rheumatology (ACR), 211 family members of these patients were also included. Genotyping was performed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. Among 77 patients with SLE, the CC, CT and TT genetype frequencies of the SNP (rs352140) were 20.8, 61.0 and 18.2%, respectively. Single loci analysis suggested that the T allele at position of rs352140 was significantly associated with the susceptibility to SLE (Z = 2.357, P = 0.018402) in dominant model, but not in additive or recessive model. Genetype analysis showed that individuals with CT genetype had greater susceptibility to SLE than those without (Z = 2.004, P = 0.045067). Our study suggests that a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs352140) in the exon 2 region of TLR9 gene may be a susceptibility factor for SLE in Chinese population."
20428408,20428408,A genetic study of the NOS3 gene for ischemic stroke in a Chinese population.,"We recruited 560 unrelated patients with ischemic stroke and 153 unrelated controls to undertake a genetic analysis for association between the NOS3 gene and ischemic stroke. All the subjects were Chinese of Han descent. Because the NOS3 gene spans about 21 kb of DNA and contains 26 exons, we selected a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3918181, an A to G base change located in intron 14 of the gene, as a DNA marker. PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was applied to genotype rs3918181 (RsaI site). The chi-square (chi(2)) goodness-of-fit test showed that the genotypic distributions of the marker were not deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both the patient group (chi(2) = 0.166, p = 0.684) and the control group (chi(2) = 0.421, p = 0.517). The cocaphase analysis showed allelic association of rs3918181 with ischemic stroke in males (chi(2) = 4.04, p = 0.044, OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.01 approximately 2.02) and frequency of allele A was significantly higher in male patients than male control subjects. The chi(2) test revealed genotypic association between rs3918181 and ischemic stroke in males (chi(2) = 4.26, df = 1, p = 0.039, OR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.02 approximately 2.53) but not in females. The present work suggests that rs3918181 is associated with ischemic stroke in male patients. This finding gives further evidence in support of the eNOS association with ischemic stroke in the Chinese population."
19113921,19113921,Genome-wide haplotype association mapping in mice identifies a genetic variant in CER1 associated with BMD and fracture in southern Chinese women.,"BMD is a heritable trait and risk indicator for osteoporosis. In this study, we used a genome-wide haplotype association mapping (HAM) approach to identify a haplotype block within Cer1 that partitions inbred mice strains into high and low BMD groups. A cohort of 1083 high and low BMD human subjects were studied, and a nonsynonymous SNP (rs3747532) in human CER1 was identified to be associated with increased risk of both low BMD in premenopausal women (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.0-4.6; p < 0.05) and increased risk of vertebral fractures (OR: 1.82, p = 0.025) in the postmenopausal cohort. We also showed that Cer1 is expressed in mouse bone and growth plate by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization, consistent with polymorphisms potentially influencing BMD. Our successful identification of an association with CER1 in humans together with our mouse study suggests that CER1 may play a role in the development of bone or its metabolism. Our study highlights the use of publicly available databases for rapidly surveying the genome for quantitative trait loci."
19219042,19219042,Genome-wide association study identifies a new breast cancer susceptibility locus at 6q25.1.,"We carried out a genome-wide association study among Chinese women to identify risk variants for breast cancer. After analyzing 607,728 SNPs in 1,505 cases and 1,522 controls, we selected 29 SNPs for a fast-track replication in an independent set of 1,554 cases and 1,576 controls. We further investigated four replicated loci in a third set of samples comprising 3,472 cases and 900 controls. SNP rs2046210 at 6q25.1, located upstream of the gene encoding estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1), showed strong and consistent association with breast cancer across all three stages. Adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) were 1.36 (1.24-1.49) and 1.59 (1.40-1.82), respectively, for genotypes A/G and A/A versus G/G (P for trend 2.0 x 10(-15)) in the pooled analysis of samples from all three stages. We also found a similar, albeit weaker, association in an independent study comprising 1,591 cases and 1,466 controls of European ancestry (P(trend) = 0.01). These results strongly implicate 6q25.1 as a susceptibility locus for breast cancer."
19112571,19112571,A functional single-nucleotide polymorphism in the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene alter vitiligo risk in a Chinese population.,"Vitiligo is an acquired hypomelanotic skin disorder resulting from the loss of functional melanocytes. The COMT-158 polymorphism can reduce COMT enzyme activity and may thus lead to the overproduction of toxic radicals in the melanocyte microenvironment. To determine whether this polymorphism in the COMT gene is associated with an increased risk of vitiligo in Chinese populations, we used a polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primer (PCR-SSP) technique to determine the frequency of the polymorphism COMT-158 G > A in 749 vitiligo patients and 763 healthy controls. We found that compared to the COMT-158 GG genotype, the COMT-158 GA genotype (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.72) and the combined GA + AA genotype (adjusted OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.15-1.74) were associated with an increased risk of generalized vitiligo. The association was more pronounced in patients with early-onset vitiligo (adjusted OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.45-2.60), those with a family history of vitiligo (adjusted OR, 3.84; 95% CI, 2.47-5.96), and female patients (adjusted OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.29-2.36). When we further clinically stratified the vitiligo patients according to their disease types, we found that the combined GA + AA genotype was associated with vitiligo vulgaris (adjusted OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02-1.68), focal vitiligo (adjusted OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.17-2.25), and universal vitiligo (adjusted OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.98-2.30), but not with acrofacial vitiligo (adjusted OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 0.86-2.73) or segmental vitiligo (adjusted OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.72-2.51). In conclusion, this COMT gene polymorphism may have contributed to the etiology of vitiligo in our Chinese population. Larger population-based studies are required to verify our findings."
19107762,19107762,Genetic susceptibility of lung cancer associated with common variants in the 3' untranslated regions of the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette B1 (ABCB1) and ABCC1 candidate transporter genes for carcinogen export.,Tobacco-specific nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NKK) is a well defined carcinogen that can induce lung cancer. Genetic polymorphisms in its disposition pathways could modify the risk of developing lung cancer. The authors of this report previously catalogued the sequence variations of the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette B1 (ABCB1) and ABCC1 candidate transporter genes for carcinogen export in the Chinese population and screened out common variants with potential function in their 5' flanking and 3' untranslated regions. The objective of the current study was to test the hypothesis that these common variants are associated with lung cancer risk.

19172394,19172394,Association between epidermal growth factor polymorphism and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma susceptibility.,"Genetic factors are known to be important in the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Epidermal growth factor (EGF) can activate several signaling pathways leading to proliferation, differentiation, and tumorigenesis of epithelial tissues by binding with its receptor. Interindividual variations in EGF production were genetically contributed to EGF +61 G/A polymorphism. The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential association between EGF gene polymorphism and ESCC in a Chinese population. In this study, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphism of EGF +61 G/A in 158 patients with ESCC and 212 age- and sex-matched controls in a Chinese population using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) strategy and DNA sequencing. The variant genotypes of GA/AA were associated with a significantly decreased risk of ESCC compared with the wild-type homozygote GG (OR = 0.657, 95% CI: 0.434-0.996). However, no significant difference was observed between the EGF +61 G/A polymorphism and the risk of ESCC when the analyses were stratified in terms of age, gender, smoking status, different clinical stage, and lymph node status. The EGF +61 G/A polymorphism is associated with ESCC in a Chinese population. Our data suggests that the EGF gene may play a role in the development of ESCC."

19064610,19064610,Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1 (PBX1) shows functional and possible genetic association with bone mineral density variation.,"Bone mineral density (BMD) is one of the major determinants of risk for osteoporotic fracture. Multiple studies reveal that peak bone mass is under strong genetic influence. One of the major susceptibility loci for peak spine BMD has been mapped to chromosome 1q21-q23 in the Caucasian population. We have previously replicated this finding in Southern Chinese pedigrees and detected a maximum multipoint log of odds (LOD) score of 2.36 in this region. To further fine-map this region, 380 single-nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers were genotyped in 610 sibpairs from 231 families. Several markers were identified in the association analysis as important candidates underlying BMD variation. Among them, successful replication was demonstrated for SNPs in pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1 (PBX1) gene in two other unrelated case-control cohorts. The functional role of PBX1 in bone metabolism was examined in vitro using human bone-derived cells (HBDC) and murine MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. PBX1 mRNA was constitutively expressed in both HBDC and MC3T3-E1 cells. Immunostaining revealed that PBX1 is localized in the nucleus compartment. Silencing of PBX1 by RNAi in MC3T3-E1 cells decreased the expression of Runx2 and Osterix, the critical transcription factors for osteogenesis, but accelerated cell proliferation and bone nodule formation. Overall, our data suggest a genetic and functional association of PBX1 with BMD."

19057645,19057645,Analysis of East Asia genetic substructure using genome-wide SNP arrays.,"Accounting for population genetic substructure is important in reducing type 1 errors in genetic studies of complex disease. As efforts to understand complex genetic disease are expanded to different continental populations the understanding of genetic substructure within these continents will be useful in design and execution of association tests. In this study, population differentiation (Fst) and Principal Components Analyses (PCA) are examined using >200 K genotypes from multiple populations of East Asian ancestry. The population groups included those from the Human Genome Diversity Panel [Cambodian, Yi, Daur, Mongolian, Lahu, Dai, Hezhen, Miaozu, Naxi, Oroqen, She, Tu, Tujia, Naxi, Xibo, and Yakut], HapMap [ Han Chinese (CHB) and Japanese (JPT)], and East Asian or East Asian American subjects of Vietnamese, Korean, Filipino and Chinese ancestry. Paired Fst (Wei and Cockerham) showed close relationships between CHB and several large East Asian population groups (CHB/Korean, 0.0019; CHB/JPT, 00651; CHB/Vietnamese, 0.0065) with larger separation with Filipino (CHB/Filipino, 0.014). Low levels of differentiation were also observed between Dai and Vietnamese (0.0045) and between Vietnamese and Cambodian (0.0062). Similarly, small Fst's were observed among different presumed Han Chinese populations originating in different regions of mainland of China and Taiwan (Fst's <0.0025 with CHB). For PCA, the first two PC's showed a pattern of relationships that closely followed the geographic distribution of the different East Asian populations. PCA showed substructure both between different East Asian groups and within the Han Chinese population. These studies have also identified a subset of East Asian substructure ancestry informative markers (EASTASAIMS) that may be useful for future complex genetic disease association studies in reducing type 1 errors and in identifying homogeneous groups that may increase the power of such studies."
18947434,18947434,Association of a single nucleotide polymorphism in growth differentiate factor 5 with congenital dysplasia of the hip: a case-control study.,"Congenital dysplasia of the hip is an abnormal seating of the femoral head in the acetabulum, mainly caused by shallow acetabulum and lax joint capsule. Genetic factors play a considerable role in the pathogenesis of congenital dysplasia of the hip. The gene growth differentiate factor 5 (GDF5) has been implicated in skeletal development and joint morphogenesis in humans and mice. A functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5'-untranslated region of GDF5 (rs143383) was reported to be associated with osteoarthritis susceptibility. As a key regulator in morphogenesis of skeletal components and soft tissues in and around the joints, GDF5 may be involved in the aetiology and pathogenesis of congenital dysplasia of the hip. Our objective is to evaluate if the GDF5 SNP is associated with congenital dysplasia of the hip in people of Han Chinese origin."

19039035,19039035,Genome-wide association study identifies two novel loci containing FLNB and SBF2 genes underlying stature variation.,"Human stature, as an important physical index in clinical practice and a usual covariate in gene mapping of complex disorders, is a highly heritable complex trait. To identify specific genes underlying stature, a genome-wide association study was performed in 1000 unrelated homogeneous Caucasian subjects using Affymetrix 500K arrays. A group of seven contiguous markers in the region of SBF2 gene (Set-binding factor 2) are associated with stature, significantly so at the genome-wide level after false discovery rate (FDR) correction (FDR q = 0.034-0.042). Three SNPs in another SNP group in the Filamin B (FLNB) gene were also associated with stature, significantly so with FDR q = 0.042-0.048. In follow-up independent replication studies, rs10734652 in the SBF2 gene was significantly (P = 0.036) and suggestively (P = 0.07) associated with stature in Caucasian families and 1306 unrelated Caucasian subjects, respectively, and rs9834312 in the FLNB gene was also associated with stature in such two independent Caucasian populations (P = 0.008 in unrelated sample and P = 0.049 in family sample). Particularly, additional significant replication association signals were detected in Chinese, an ethnic population different from Caucasian, between rs9834312 and stature in 619 unrelated northern Chinese subjects (P = 0.017), as well as between rs10734652 and stature in 2953 unrelated southern Chinese subjects (P = 0.048). This study also provides additional replication evidence for some of the already published stature loci. These results, together with the known functional relevance of the SBF2 and FLNB genes to skeletal linear growth and bone formation, support that two regions containing FLNB and SBF2 genes are two novel loci underlying stature variation."
19034521,19034521,Associations of PLA2G7 gene polymorphisms with plasma lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 activity and coronary heart disease in a Chinese Han population: the Beijing atherosclerosis study.,"The human PLA2G7 gene encodes lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-PLA(2)), an emerging risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PLA2G7 gene were genotyped in 827 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), of which 512 were patients with myocardial infarction (MI), and 947 age- and gender-matched controls in a Chinese Han population. Plasma Lp-PLA(2) activity was measured in 416 randomly selected controls and 689 randomly selected CHD patients, including 423 MI patients. Lp-PLA(2) activity in CHD and MI cases was significantly higher (233.42+/-57.66 and 234.27+/-59.51 nmol ml(-1) min(-1), respectively) than in controls (211.47+/-58.61 nmol ml(-1) min(-1)). After adjusting for traditional risk factors by logistic regression, the odds ratios for CHD and MI per 1 standard deviation increment of Lp-PLA(2) activity were 1.27 (95% CI, 1.07-1.50) and 1.27 (95% CI, 1.05-1.54), respectively. Both single SNP analysis and haplotype analysis showed that the V279F and I198T polymorphisms were significantly associated with the reduced Lp-PLA(2) activity, but neither was associated with increased CHD risk. Both univariate and multivariate analyses, adjusting effects of conventional factors, indicated that the rs13210554 T allele increased the risk of MI in this Chinese Han population. In summary, an independent association of increased plasma Lp-PLA(2) activity with CHD and MI existed in this Chinese Han Population. Although V279F and I198T mutations significantly decreased the activity of Lp-PLA(2), only the promoter rs13210554 polymorphism was associated with MI. Lp-PLA(2) activity appears to influence the CHD and MI risk in Chinese Han population."

Several studies have indicated that a deficient CaM function is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA). Using a convincing genome-wide association study, a Japanese group has recently demonstrated a genetic association between the CALM1 core promoter polymorphism (-16C/T transition SNP, rs12885713) and OA susceptibility. However, the subsequent association studies failed to provide consistent results in OA patients of differently selected populations. The present study is to evaluate the association of the -16C/T polymorphism with knee OA in a Chinese Han population."
18813331,18813331,Variations in HSP70 genes associated with noise-induced hearing loss in two independent populations.,"Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is one of the most important occupational health hazards. Millions of people worldwide are exposed daily to harmful levels of noise. NIHL is a complex disease resulting from an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Although the environmental risk factors have been studied extensively, little is known about the genetic factors. Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) are induced after exposure to severe noise. When first induced by exposure to moderate sound levels, they can protect the ear from damage from excessive noise exposure. This protection is highly variable between individuals. An association of HSP70 genes with NIHL has been described by Yang et al (2006) in a Chinese sample set of noise-exposed workers. In this study, three polymorphisms (rs1043618, rs1061581 and rs2227956) in HSP70-1, HSP70-2 and HSP70-hom, respectively, were genotyped in 206 Swedish and 238 Polish DNA samples of noise-exposed subjects and analyzed. One SNP, rs2227956 in HSP70-hom, resulted in a significant association with NIHL in both sample sets. In addition, rs1043618 and rs1061581 were significant in the Swedish sample set. Analysis of the haplotypes composed of the three SNPs revealed significant associations between NIHL and haplotype GAC in both sample sets and with haplotype CGT in the Swedish sample set. In conclusion, this study replicated the association of HSP70 genes with NIHL in a second and third independent noise-exposed sample set, hereby adding to the evidence that HSP70 genes may be NIHL susceptibility genes."

18787534,18787534,Association of skin barrier genes within the PSORS4 locus is enriched in Singaporean Chinese with early-onset psoriasis.,"Psoriasis (OMIM#177900) is a common polygenic skin disorder affecting approximately 2% of the northern European population and 0.1% of the Han Chinese. Psoriasis patients suffer from chronic skin inflammation, manifested by erythematous scaly lesions. PSORS1-PSORS9 have been confirmed as psoriasis susceptibility loci in independent genetic studies on predominantly Caucasian populations, with psoriasis susceptibility loci (PSORS1, PSORS9) and additional loci at 9q33-34 and 2p22.3-11.2 reported in Han Chinese patients. In this study, we show the association of PSORS4 with psoriasis in Singaporean Chinese. Dense genotyping of single-nucleotide polymorphism-tagging candidate genes within the epidermal differentiation complex revealed significant association in the proximity of the involucrin gene (IVL); the strongest association was seen in early-onset psoriasis patients (P=0.0014). A follow-up genome-wide association screen localized the psoriasis susceptibility region to approximately 360 kb along chromosome 1 in the vicinity of IVL, small proline-rich region (SPRR) and proline-rich region 9 (PRR9) genes. The study of interactions between the causative variant(s) in this locus will provide insights into a possible role for epidermal barrier formation in the pathogenesis of psoriasis."

However, the exact mechanism of gastrointestinal cancer development still remains unclear. RAS genes have been elucidated as major participants in the development and progression of a series of human tumours and the single nucleotide polymorphism at H-RAS cDNA position 81 was demonstrated to contribute to the risks of bladder, oral and thyroid carcinoma. Therefore, we hypothesized that this polymorphisms in H-RAS could influence susceptibility to gastrointestinal cancer as well, and we conducted this study to test the hypothesis in Chinese population."
19032295,19032295,Association between human opioid receptor genes polymorphisms and pressure pain sensitivity in females*.,"This study examined the association between pressure pain sensitivity and various single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of human micro-, kappa-, and delta-opioid receptor (i.e. OPRM1, OPRK1, and OPRD1) genes in 72 healthy adult Taiwanese women of Han Chinese race. Pressure pain threshold and tolerance were measured by an algometer and polymorphisms of the opioid receptor genes determined from blood samples. Our data revealed that pressure pain threshold, but not tolerance, in subjects with the minor allele (termed 'GA') genotype of the IVS2+31G>A polymorphism of the OPRM1 gene was significantly higher than those with major allele (termed 'GG') genotype. Neither pressure pain threshold nor tolerance between major and minor alleles of other SNPs of the OPRM1, OPRK1, and OPRD1 genes were significantly different. These data suggest an association between the IVS2+31G>A SNP of the OPRM1 gene and pressure pain sensitivity in healthy adult females."

18776929,18776929,Identification of PLCL1 gene for hip bone size variation in females in a genome-wide association study.,"Osteoporosis, the most prevalent metabolic bone disease among older people, increases risk for low trauma hip fractures (HF) that are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Hip bone size (BS) has been identified as one of the key measurable risk factors for HF. Although hip BS is highly genetically determined, genetic factors underlying the trait are still poorly defined. Here, we performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of hip BS interrogating approximately 380,000 SNPs on the Affymetrix platform in 1,000 homogeneous unrelated Caucasian subjects, including 501 females and 499 males. We identified a gene, PLCL1 (phospholipase c-like 1), that had four SNPs associated with hip BS at, or approaching, a genome-wide significance level in our female subjects; the most significant SNP, rs7595412, achieved a p value of 3.72x10(-7). The gene's importance to hip BS was replicated using the Illumina genotyping platform in an independent UK cohort containing 1,216 Caucasian females. Two SNPs of the PLCL1 gene, rs892515 and rs9789480, surrounded by the four SNPs identified in our GWAS, achieved p values of 8.62x10(-3) and 2.44x10(-3), respectively, for association with hip BS. Imputation analyses on our GWAS and the UK samples further confirmed the replication signals; eight SNPs of the gene achieved combined imputed p values<10(-5) in the two samples. The PLCL1 gene's relevance to HF was also observed in a Chinese sample containing 403 females, including 266 with HF and 177 control subjects. A SNP of the PLCL1 gene, rs3771362 that is only approximately 0.6 kb apart from the most significant SNP detected in our GWAS (rs7595412), achieved a p value of 7.66x10(-3) (odds ratio = 0.26) for association with HF. Additional biological support for the role of PLCL1 in BS comes from previous demonstrations that the PLCL1 protein inhibits IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate)-mediated calcium signaling, an important pathway regulating mechanical sensing of bone cells. Our findings suggest that PLCL1 is a novel gene associated with variation in hip BS, and provide new insights into the pathogenesis of HF."

18727211,18727211,Study on association of single nucleotide polymorphism of CAPN1 gene with muscle fibre and carcass traits in quality chicken populations.,"This study was aimed at investigating the effect of the calpain 1 (CAPN1) gene on carcass and meat quality traits in eight meat-type chicken populations, including five pure lines (developed from Chinese local breeds) and three cross-breeds. Primer pairs for the Coding Sequence (CDS) region in CAPN1 were designed from the chicken genomic sequence database. Polymorphisms were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP; C2546T, G3535A and C7198A) were detected among individuals in each population. The associations of their haplotypes (H1 = CGA, H2 = CGC, H3 = CAA, H4 = CAC, H5 = TGA and H7 = TAA) with chicken breast muscle fibre and carcass traits were analysed. Results showed that the haplotypes were associated with live weight (LW), carcass weight (CW), breast muscle weight (BMW) and leg muscle weight (LMW) (p < 0.05), and were also related to eviscerated percentage (%EP) and breast muscle fibre density (p < 0.01). H1H3 haplotype was dominant for LW, CW and BMW; H1H5 haplotype was dominant for EP; H3H4 haplotype was dominant for LMW and H1H1 haplotype was dominant for BFD. It was concluded that the CAPN1 gene may be a major gene affecting meat quality traits of chicken or it is linked with the major gene. H1H3, H1H5 and H3H4 were the most advantageous haplotypes for carcass traits whereas H1H1 was the positive haplotype for breast muscle fibre trait."

18619437,18619437,MUC1 and estrogen receptor alpha gene polymorphisms in dry eye patients.,"Dry eye syndrome is a collection of common disorders of multifactorial etiology. Although the epidemiology of dry eye has been well studied, reports of genetic patterns that might influence susceptibility to dry eye are few. We reported that the frequency of non-Sjögren's aqueous-deficient dry eye patients expressing only the MUC1/A splice variant of the mucin MUC1 may be lower than that of a normal control group [Imbert, Y., Darling, D.S., Jumblatt, M.M., Foulks, G.N., Couzin, E.G., Steele, P.S., Young, W.W., Jr., 2006. MUC1 splice variants in human ocular surface tissues: possible differences between dry eye patients and normal controls. Exp. Eye Res. 83, 493-501]. Also, He et al. [He, Y., Li, X., Bao, Y., Sun, J., Liu, J., 2006. The correlation of polymorphism of estrogen receptor gene to dry eye syndrome in postmenopausal women. Yan. Ke. Xue. Bao. 22, 233-236] reported a difference between Chinese dry eye and control groups in the frequency of a polymorphism in estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha). In the present study we determined the statistical significance and generality of these observations and tested if the MUC1 splice variant difference between subject groups reflected a difference in the MUC1 variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) size class. There was a perfect correlation between the MUC1/A or MUC1/B splice variant pattern and the SNP genotype frequency of the SNP (rs4072037) controlling that splicing event. In contrast, western and Southern blotting indicated that MUC1 VNTR size class corresponded to the MUC1 SNP genotype in only 80% of cases. We determined the status of the MUC1 SNP in normal and dry eye populations all of whom were female Caucasians. The MUC1 SNP genotype frequency of the normal control group was statistically different from both the non-Sjögren's aqueous-deficient dry eye group with ocular surface staining (P=0.017) and the evaporative dry eye group (P=0.015). We also tested SNP rs2234693 to analyze the polymorphism in the ERalpha gene and found no significant difference in the SNP genotype frequency between the control group and either of the dry eye subtypes. Thus, among Caucasians there is no evidence for an association of the ERalpha gene polymorphism with dry eye syndrome as previously described in a Chinese population. In conclusion, the etiologies of evaporative dry eye and non-Sjögren's aqueous-deficient dry eye are known to be different. However, our results suggest that both of these subtypes of dry eye disease may share a common mechanism or factor related to MUC1 genotypic differences that affects susceptibility to ocular surface damage. This altered susceptibility may not be related to the MUC1 VNTR size class. Therefore, mechanisms influencing protection of the ocular surface against inflammation and damage in different types of dry eye disease warrant further investigation particularly in relation to MUC1 genotype."
18680468,18680468,Interethnic and intraethnic variability of NAT2 single nucleotide polymorphisms.,"Genetic polymorphisms of human arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) are responsible for interindividual variation in the acetylation of numerous drugs and in the transformation of aromatic and heterocyclic amines into carcinogenic intermediates. Although large interethnic variability in the frequency for NAT2 variant alleles has been reported, comparison of allele frequencies is hampered by differences in the criteria for the assignment of allelic variants. To avoid such sources of bias, in this review we analyze the occurrence of both interethnic and intraethnic variability for the seven commonest single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the NAT2 gene by using raw SNP data instead of inferred haplotypes. Besides the large interethnic variability observed for all SNPs except C282T, intraethnic variability for NAT2 SNPs was identified for the SNPs G191A among Caucasians (p<0.0001), T341C among Oriental (p<0.001) or African individuals (p<0.012), C481T among Oriental (p<0.001) or African individuals (p<0.001), and G590A among Oriental individuals (p<0.001). In contrast, no major intraethnic differences were identified for the SNPs C282T, A806G or G857A. Intraethnic variability may have relevant clinical implications. For instance, case-control NAT2 studies should not be extrapolated from one Oriental population to another. Nonsynonymous SNPs occur in 32% of alleles in Japanese individuals and in 47% of alleles in Chinese individuals, therefore the frequency of adverse effects and cancer related to slow acetylation is expected to be higher in individuals with Chinese descent than in those with Japanese descent. Intraethnic variability reinforces the need for proper selection of control subjects and points against the use of surrogate control groups for studies involving association of NAT2 alleles with adverse drug effects or spontaneous diseases."

18600092,18600092,Association of platelet-derived growth factor-D gene polymorphism with ischemic stroke in a Chinese case-control study.,"Stroke is a multiple genetic disease. Platelet-derived growth factor-D has been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, suggesting possible association between platelet-derived growth factor-D and the development of ischemic stroke. However, little information on the relationship between platelet-derived growth factor-D and stroke is currently available. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between platelet-derived growth factor-D genetic variation and the risk of ischemic stroke in a Chinese population. We conducted a case-control study with 309 ischemic stroke patients and 309 sex and age (<5 years)-matched controls. DNA was extracted from the whole blood of each participant. Platelet-derived growth factor-D C/G polymorphism at position +3166 (rs7950273) was detected by TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. Overall, the combined rates of platelet-derived growth factor- D CG and GG are 51% in patients in contrast with 46% in controls. There were no significant differences in the genotype frequencies of platelet-derived growth factor-D +3166 polymorphisms between the patients and controls with history or family history of hypertension or diabetes (P = 0.770). However, among people without history or family history of hypertension or diabetes, platelet-derived growth factor-D CG/GG is significantly more frequently expressed in patients (60%) than in controls (43%) (odds ratio 1.97; 95% confidence interval 1.19-3.26). This significant association holds after adjustment for age, sex, smoking and alcohol intaking (odds ratio 1.86; 95% confidence interval 1.11-3.10) (P = 0.018). Our study found that the G allele of rs7950273 of the platelet-derived growth factor-D gene is associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke in a Chinese population without history or family history of hypertension or diabetes. Future studies with larger and ethnically diverse populations are needed to further evaluate the platelet-derived growth factor-D polymorphism and stroke association, as well as its pathophysiological mechanisms."
18544180,18544180,Evidence for association between the 5' flank of the NOS1 gene and schizophrenia in the Chinese population.,"Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in the dopaminergic and serotonergic system as the second messenger of the NMDA receptor and has possible roles in neurotransmission, neurosecretion, synaptic plasticity, and tissue injury in many neurological disorders, including schizophrenia. There is also genetic evidence to support the human NOS1 (neuronal nitric oxide synthase 1) gene as a promising candidate gene associated with schizophrenia. In this paper we conducted a case-control association study involving 1705 Chinese subjects and 12 genetic markers [11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1 microsatellite] mainly in the 5' flank region of the gene by direct sequencing and capillary electrophoresis. We identified SNP rs3782206 and several haplotypes derived from it as being significantly associated with schizophrenia and, specifically, in a paranoid subgroup. Our results strongly support a previous hypothesis that NOS1 contributes to the genetic risk of schizophrenia and suggest that further research on more NOS1 variants and its regular elements are warranted."

Hence it is a good candidate for genetic studies in DDD."
18398712,18398712,No association found between the promoter variants of TNF-alpha and diabetic retinopathy in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes.,Necrosis tumor factor (TNF) is known to be associated with diabetic retinopathy (DR). The objective of this study was to examine the genetic variations of TNF-alpha and assess their possible relationship to DR in type 2 diabetic patients in the Chinese population.
18584117,18584117,Two-stage designs to identify the effects of SNP combinations on complex diseases.,"The genetic basis of complex diseases is expected to be highly heterogeneous, with many disease genes, where each gene by itself has only a small effect. Based on the nonlinear contributions of disease genes across the genome to complex diseases, we introduce the concept of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) synergistic blocks. A two-stage approach is applied to detect the genetic association of synergistic blocks with a disease. In the first stage, synergistic blocks associated with a complex disease are identified by clustering SNP patterns and choosing blocks within a cluster that minimize a diversity criterion. In the second stage, a logistic regression model is given for a synergistic block. Using simulated case-control data, we demonstrate that our method has reasonable power to identify gene-gene interactions. To further evaluate the performance of our method, we apply our method to 17 loci of four candidate genes for paranoid schizophrenia in a Chinese population. Five synergistic blocks are found to be associated with schizophrenia, three of which are negatively associated (odds ratio, OR < 0.3, P < 0.05), while the others are positively associated (OR > 2.0, P < 0.05). The mathematical models of these five synergistic blocks are presented. The results suggest that there may be interactive effects for schizophrenia among variants of the genes neuregulin 1 (NRG1, 8p22-p11), G72 (13q34), the regulator of G-protein signaling-4 (RGS4, 1q21-q22) and frizzled 3 (FZD3, 8p21). Using synergistic blocks, we can reduce the dimensionality in a multi-locus association analysis, and evaluate the sizes of interactive effects among multiple disease genes on complex phenotypes."

DNA methylation is mediated by a family of DNA methyltransferases. Polymorphisms of the DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) gene may influence DNMT3B activity on DNA methylation, thereby modulating the susceptibility to some diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in promoter of the DNMT3B gene and the risk for development of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)."
18387843,18387843,Lack of evidence for association of a parkin promoter polymorphism with early-onset Parkinson's disease in a Chinese population.,"Mutations in parkin are a common cause of early-onset autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PD). A single nucleotide polymorphism in the parkin promoter (rs9347683, -258T/G) has been reported to be associated with PD and shown to functionally affect gene transcription in luciferase reporter assays. In addition, homozygosity for the minor allele of rs9347683 may significantly reduce the age of onset of PD. We investigated the polymorphism in a cohort of cases with early-onset PD previously excluded for mutations in PD associated loci. We did not observe any differences in allele or genotype frequencies between the cases and the controls and there was no evidence for an effect on age of disease onset. Our results do not support a role for this variant in early-onset PD."

18434216,18434216,Absence of association of asporin polymorphisms and osteoarthritis susceptibility in US Caucasians.,An association between osteoarthritis (OA) and functional polymorphisms in the aspartic acid (d) repeat of the asporin (ASPN) gene was reported in Japanese and Han Chinese populations. The aim of this study was to assess the association of variants in the ASPN gene with the presence of radiographic hand and/or knee OA in a US Caucasian population.
18389292,18389292,Association of bone morphogenetic protein-2 gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine and its severity in Chinese patients.,"A case-control study was conducted to examine the association between two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exon 2 of the bone morphogenetic protein-2 gene (BMP-2) and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), and to investigate whether SNPs of the Ser37Ala (T/G) and the Ser87Ser (A/G) in the BMP-2 gene are associated with genetic susceptibility to OPLL and its severity in Chinese subjects. The Ser87Ser (A/G) SNP has been implicated in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases the risk of OA in women. The Ser37Ala (T/G) SNP is associated with BMD and the rate of bone loss in osteoporosis and osteoporosis fractures. A total of 57 OPLL patients and 135 non-OPLL controls were studied. Radiographs of the cervical spine were analyzed to determine the presence and the severity of OPLL. The association of two SNPs with the occurrence and the extent of OPLL were statistically evaluated. There was a significant association between the Ser37Ala (T/G) polymorphism and the occurrence of OPLL in the cervical spine. However, no significant association was found between the Ser37Ala (T/G) polymorphism and the more number of ossified cervical vertebrae in OPLL patients. There was a significant association between the Ser87Ser (A/G) polymorphism and the more number of ossified cervical vertebrae in OPLL patients. However, there was no statistical difference between the Ser87Ser (A/G) SNP and the occurrence of OPLL in the cervical spine. In addition, the Ser87Ser (A/G) polymorphism in male patients and in female patients showed no statistical difference between cases and controls. The present results demonstrate that BMP-2 Gene is not only a factor associated with the occurrence of OPLL, but also a factor related to more extensive OPLL. The ""G"" allele in the Ser37Ala (T/G) polymorphism is associated with the occurrence of OPLL, but not more extensive OPLL in the cervical spine. The ""G"" allele in the Ser87Ser (A/G) polymorphism promotes the extent of OPLL, whereas the ""A"" allele in the Ser87Ser (A/G) polymorphism restricts ectopic ossification in the cervical spine at least in Chinese subjects."
20157399,20157399,Assessment of Relationship between Fyn-related Kinase Gene Polymorphisms and Overweight/Obesity in Korean Population.,"The fyn-related kinase (FRK) belongs to the tyrosine kinase family of protein kinases. Recent studies have shown that Frk affects pancreatic beta cell number during embryogenesis and promotes beta cell cytotoxic signals in response to streptozotocin. To investigate the genetic association between FRK polymorphisms and the risk of obesity in Korean population, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FRK gene region were selected and analyzed. The body mass index (BMI) was calculated, and biochemical data (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1C, triglyceride, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, and low density lipoprotein) of blood sample from each subject were also measured. One hundred fifty five healthy control and 204 overweight/obesity subjects were recruited. Genotype frequencies of six SNPs [rs6568920 (+8391G>A), rs3756772 (+56780A>G), rs3798234 (+75687C>T), rs9384970 (+68506G>A), rs1933739 (+72978G>A), and rs9400883 (+75809A>G)] in the FRK gene were determined by Affymetrix Targeted Genotyping Chip data. According to the classification of Korean Society for the Study of Obesity, control (BMI 18 to <23) and overweight/obesity (BMI>/=23) subjects were recruited. For the analysis of genetic data, EM algorithm, SNPStats, Haploview, HapAnalyzer, SNPAnalyzer, and Helixtree programs were used. Multiple logistic regression analysis (codominant, dominant, and recessive models) was performed. Age and gender as covariates were adjusted. For biochemical data, Student's t test was used. The mean value of BMI in the control and overweigh/obesity groups was 21.1+/-1.2 (mean+/-SD) and 25.6+/-2.0, respectively. All biochemical data of the overweight/obesity group were statistically significance, compared with the control group. Among six SNPs, two linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks were discovered. One block consisted of rs1933739 and rs9400883, and the other comprised rs3756772 and rs3798234. One SNP (rs9384970, +68506G>A) showed an association with overweight/obesity in the codominant model (p=0.03). Interestingly, the AA genotype distribution in the overweight/obesity group (n=7, 3.5%) was higher than those in the control group (n=1, 0.6%), which is not found in either Japanese or Chinese subjects. Therefore, the AA genotype of rs9384970 may be a risk factor for development of obesity in Korean population. The results suggest that FRK may be associated with overweight/obesity in Korean population."
18358646,18358646,Identification of polymorphism and association analysis with reproductive traits in the porcine RNF4 gene.,"The ring finger protein 4 gene (RNF4), which might play a role in fetal germ cell development as well as in oocyte and granulosa cell maturation, was one of the potential candidate genes for reproductive traits. In the present work, we isolated the complete coding sequence of porcine RNF4 gene, identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP: T/C) in intron5, and developed a PCR-SacII-RFLP genotyping assay. Association of this SNP with reproductive traits was assessed in three populations with diverse genetic backgrounds. One was Chinese Qingping sows. Another was consisted of crossbred sows derived from Landrace, Large White, Chinese Tongcheng and/or Chinese Meishan (Line DIV). The third is Large White x Meishan (LW x M) F(2) slaughtered population. Statistical analysis demonstrated that, in the first parity, the difference between RNF4 genotypes and reproductive traits of both Qingping and Line DIV sows was not significant. In the second and subsequent litters, CC animals in Qingping population had more piglets born (+1.74 piglets) and piglets born alive (+2.02 piglets) than sows with the TT genotype (P<0.05). Line DIV sows inheriting the CC genotype had additional 0.69 piglets born compared to the TC animals (P<0.05) in second and subsequent litters. No significant difference was observed between genotypes and reproductive tracts components in F(2) animals. In addition, we found RNF4 gene has a significant additive effect on both piglet born and piglet born alive in Qingping animals (P<0.05). Results here suggested that the RNF4 SNP was significantly associated with litter size in two populations and could be useful in selection for increasing litter size in pigs. Further studies were needed to confirm these preliminary researches."
18335162,18335162,Comprehensive analysis of polymorphisms throughout GAD1 gene: a family-based association study in schizophrenia.,"Studies suggest that GAD1 gene is a functional candidate susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. In order to investigate the contribution of GAD1 gene to the etiology of schizophrenia in Chinese, we carried out a family-based association study between GAD1 gene and schizophrenia in 235 Chinese Han family trios. The GAD1 gene is comprehensively analyzed using a systematic mutation scan and the following-up association studies between common SNPs and schizophrenia in both single-locus and haplotype levels. Altogether, we have found 17 variants including 10 SNPs in 5'-flanking regions, 4 SNPs and one novel in-del in intronic regions and 2 SNPs (one novel SNP) in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR). Using the transmission disequilibrium test of the 9 common SNPs out of 17 variants, Significant evidence of SNP rs3791878-G allele in 5'-flanking region of GAD1 was preferentially transmitted to both the all offsprings of the trios (P = 0.0063, respectively; odds ratio = 1.83; 95% confidence interval: 1.26-2.65) and the male offsprings the trios (P = 0.0045, respectively; odds ratio = 2.21; 95% confidence interval: 1.37-3.56). Haplotype analysis suggested that rs3762556(C)-rs3791878(G)-rs6755102(C) is the major risky haplotype preferentially transmitted in both all the trios and male-offspring trios (Global P = 0.016 and 0.012, respectively). The gender-dependent of the risk of SNP rs3791878 suggest the complexity of GAD1 gene in schizophrenia. Given that the switch from G to T in SNP rs3791878 might cause the loss of ARNT and XBP1 transcriptional factor binding sites using a bioinformatics approach, our positive findings of this SNP support the hypothesis that the abruption of GAD1 gene is important to the risk of schizophrenia."
18318911,18318911,Association of Epstein-Barr virus antibody titers with a human IL-10 promoter polymorphism in Japanese women.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) risk, over 10-fold higher in Western than in Asian countries, is associated with elevated IgG antibody titers against Epstein-Barr viral capcid antigen (anti-EBVCA IgG titers). Given the 84% homology of the open reading frame BCRF1 of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to human interleukin 10 (hIL-10) and the remarkable Caucasian-vs.-Asian population differences in hIL-10 gene promoter polymorphisms, this strong association of MS risk with anti-EB-VCA IgG titers may be explained by the genetic variations in the hIL-10 gene."
18383516,18383516,The modifying effect of C-reactive protein gene polymorphisms on the association between central obesity and endometrial cancer risk.,"Obesity is a major risk factor for endometrial cancer. Obesity, particularly central obesity, is considered as a systemic inflammatory condition and is related strongly to insulin resistance. C-reactive protein (CRP) is the most recognized biologic marker of chronic systematic inflammation, and it is conceivable that the CRP gene may work together with obesity in the development of endometrial cancer."
18501464,18501464,Absence of evidence for an association between resistin gene variants and insulin resistance in an Asian population with low and high blood pressure.,"Although the function of resistin in human biology is unclear, some evidence suggests resistin gene variants influence insulin resistance, and insulin resistance-related hypertension. We searched for associations between common resistin gene variants and factors related to insulin resistance in Asian individuals with high or low blood pressure (BP)."
18312479,18312479,PTPRC (CD45) variation and disease association studied using single nucleotide polymorphism tagging.,"CD45 is a haemopoietic tyrosine phosphatase, crucial for lymphocyte signalling. Two polymorphisms (C77G and A138G), which alter CD45 isoform expression, are associated with autoimmune and infectious diseases. Using HapMap data, we show that there is substantial linkage disequilibrium across the CD45 gene (PTPRC), with similar patterns in different populations. Employing a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms, correlated with a substantial proportion of variation across this gene, we tested for association with type 1 diabetes, Graves' disease in a Japanese population, hepatitis C in UK population and tuberculin response in a Chinese population. A limited number of common haplotypes was found. Most 138G alleles are present on only one haplotype, which is associated with Graves' disease, supporting previous data that A138G is a functionally important CD45 polymorphism."
18311594,18311594,Association of deoxyribonuclease I genetic polymorphisms with myocardial infarction in Han Chinese.,"Deoxyribonuclease I gene exhibits polymorphisms, including a single nucleotide polymorphism (A2317G) and a 56 bp variable number of tandem repeat, designated as HumDN1. G2317 was regarded as an independent risk factor for Japanese myocardial infarction (MI) patients. We investigated the association between either A2317G or HumDN1 polymorphism of deoxyribonuclease I gene and MI in Han Chinese population. A2317G and HumDN1 polymorphisms in 278 MI patients and 297 unrelated controls were detected by PCR and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Plasma lipids were measured in fasting state by biochemical methods. A new HumDN1 genotype -HumDN1 4/6 was found in Han Chinese MI patients. Genotype distributions and allele frequencies of A2317G and HumDN1 did not differ between MI patients and control group (all P > 0.05). In addition, none of estimated haplotypes significantly increased or decreased the risk of MI. In analysis of covariance, plasma total cholesterol was observed to be associated with HumDN1 genotypes in MI patients (P = 0.02). Our data suggest HumDN1 genotypes are related to total cholesterol levels in Han Chinese MI patients, but deoxyribonuclease I gene polymorphisms are not associated with susceptibility to MI in Han Chinese."

The frequencies of 2 common polymorphisms of the PPARgamma gene, Pro12Ala single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon B and C161T SNP in exon 6, were investigated in 792 subjects and the correlations between the different genotypes, IR and metabolic syndrome (MS) were analyzed."
18281137,18281137,"Association of missense variants of the PRKC, apoptosis, WT1, regulator (PAWR) gene with schizophrenia.","Abnormal dopamine signal transduction is implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. A recent study showed that prostate apoptosis response 4 protein (Par-4) interacts with dopamine D2 receptor and plays an important role in dopamine signaling. Par-4 knockout mice showed depression-like behavior, suggesting that Par-4 gene may be associated with mental disorders in human. The study was aimed to determine whether the PRKC, apoptosis, WT1, regulator gene (PAWR) that encodes the human homolog of Par-4 protein is a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. We systematically screened for mutations at the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) and all the exonic regions of the PAWR gene in a sample of Han Chinese schizophrenic patients from Taiwan. We identified two missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are in strong linkage in our sample (D'=0.98), i.e. P78R at exon 2 and I199M at exon 3, respectively. SNP- and haplotype-based analysis showed that these two variants are associated with schizophrenia; there is an overrepresentation of RR homozygotes of P78R (OR=2.00, 95% CI=1.05-3.83) and MM homozygotes of I199M (OR=1.81, 95% CI=0.95-3.54) in schizophrenic patients as compared to control subjects. When subjects were divided by gender, the association is specifically with female patients (OR=2.94 for RR and OR=2.7 for MM), but not with male patients. Our results indicate that the PAWR gene is associated with schizophrenia in our population, and this study provides genetic evidence to support the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia."
18270977,18270977,A family- and population-based study of the UFD1L gene for schizophrenia.,"The present work was undertaken to investigate the association of the UFD1L locus with schizophrenia among 304 Chinese family trios of Han descent. We detected four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5'-end region of the UFD1L gene. The transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) revealed allelic associations for rs5746744 (chi(2) = 8.02, P = 0.005) and rs1547931 (chi(2) = 7.18, P = 0.007), but failed to replicate disease association for rs5992403 present in the promoter region, which was initially found in Italian and Canadian samples. The allelic association for rs5746744 and rs1547931 was replicated with independently recruited case-control samples. The 2-SNP haplotype analysis showed an association for the rs5992403-rs5746744 haplotypes (chi(2) = 18.92, df = 3, P = 0.0003), the rs5746744-rs1547931 haplotypes (chi(2) = 11.06, df = 3, P = 0.011) and the rs1547931-rs2238769 haplotypes (chi(2) = 18.88, df = 3, P = 0.0003). The 4-SNP haplotype analysis also showed strong association with illness (chi(2) = 29.54, df = 9, P = 0.0005) but there were more than one individual haplotypes with a low frequency excessively non-transmitted. The four SNPs tested were not located in the same LD block among the Chinese population. This study raises the possibility that a disease-resistant variant may be carried by two or more haplotypes at the UFD1L locus due to frequent recombination during meiosis."

To examine the transferability of Han Chinese in Beijing HapMap data to the Southern Han Chinese in Shanghai, we performed comparative analyses between genotypes from over 4,500 SNPs in a 21 Mb region on chromosome 1q21-q25 in 80 unrelated Shanghai Chinese and 45 HapMap Chinese data."
18230834,18230834,Association of +45G15G(T/G) and +276(G/T) polymorphisms in the ADIPOQ gene with polycystic ovary syndrome among Han Chinese women.,Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is frequently associated with insulin resistance (IR) and consequently with increased risk of metabolic disorders. Adiponectin is the most abundant adipocytokine and may play a role in the regulation of insulin sensitivity and IR in PCOS. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the genetic influence of the adiponectin (ADIPOQ) gene polymorphisms in the development of PCOS among Han Chinese women.
18288382,18288382,Analysis of polymorphisms in the 3' untranslated region of the LDL receptor gene and their effect on plasma cholesterol levels and drug response.,"The proximal section of the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of LDL receptor (LDLR) mRNA contains important regulatory sequences that control the messenger stability and mediate the cholesterol-lowering drug berberine (BBR)-induced increase in LDLR mRNA half-life. In the present study, we examined whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within this region cause a predisposition to the development of coronary heart disease (CHD) and whether they affect the response to BBR treatment. Genomic DNAs were isolated from peripheral blood of a Chinese cohort of 103 normolipidemic subjects and 94 hyperlipidemic CHD patients. The 1.1-kb proximal fragment of LDLR mRNA 3'UTR was PCR-amplified and sequenced. Six SNPs were detected within this region. Among them, the presence of SNP1 and SNP6 in both study groups showed complete association (r2=1). The frequency of individual SNPs and genotypes did not differ between CHD patients and normolipidemic individuals. Allelic variations did not correlate with total and LDL-cholesterol levels. To examine the effects of genetic variations in 3'UTR on BBR treatment, entire 2.5-kb regions of 3'UTR from three common SNP haplotypes were cloned into a luciferase reporter and the reporter constructs were transfected into HepG2 cells. The expression of reporter genes carrying different haplotypes of LDLR 3'UTR was increased to a similar extent upon BBR treatment. Taken together, these findings suggest that the 3'UTR LDLR polymorphisms commonly found in the Chinese population do not cause a predisposition to the development of CHD, nor do they affect the plasma lipid levels or the cholesterol-lowering effect of BBR."
18349110,18349110,Polymorphisms in metallothionein-1 and -2 genes associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its complications.,"Metallothionein (MT) as a potent antioxidant can affect energy metabolism. The present study was undertaken to investigate the association between MT gene polymorphism and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Using the PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism method, seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MT genes (rs8052394 and rs11076161 in MT1A gene, rs8052334, rs964372, and rs7191779 in MT1B gene, rs708274 in MT1E gene, and rs10636 in MT2A gene) were detected in 851 Chinese people of Han descent (397 diabetes and 454 controls). Several serum measurements were also examined randomly for 43 diabetic patients and 41 controls. The frequency distributions of the G allele in SNP rs8052394 of MT1A gene were significantly associated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes. There was no difference between patients and controls for the rest of six SNPs. Serum levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were higher, and serum superoxide dismutase activity was significantly lower in the diabetic group than those in the control group. For diabetic patients, serum superoxide dismutase activity was significantly lower in GG or GA carriers than those of AA carriers of rs8052394 SNP. Increased serum levels in diabetic patients were positively associated with rs964372 SNP, and type 2 diabetes with neuropathy was positively associated with rs10636 and rs11076161. These results suggest that multiple SNPs in MT genes are associated with diabetes and its clinical symptoms. Furthermore, MT1A gene in rs8052394 SNP is most likely the predisposition gene locus for diabetes or changes of serum superoxide dismutase activity."
18208403,18208403,A functional intronic variant in the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene confers risk of essential hypertension in the Northern Chinese Han population.,"The TH (tyrosine hydroxylase) gene encodes the rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine biosynthesis, and is involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension, but the relationship of its variants with hypertension has not been extensively studied. We designed a case-controlled study consisting of 503 HT (hypertensive) individuals and 490 NT (normotensive) individuals matched by region, age and gender to systematically investigate the association between the TH gene and hypertension. Based on the HapMap and dbSNP (where SNP is single nucleotide polymorphism) data, four SNPs, rs6356 A>G, rs6357 G>A, rs2070762 T>C and rs1800033 A>G in the TH gene were selected for genotyping. Rs1800033 was not polymorphic in our study population. No significant differences were observed for distributions of rs6356 and rs6357 between the HT and NT groups. However, both the genotype and allele frequencies of rs2070762 showed significant differences between cases and controls (P<0.001 and P=0.005 respectively). In haplotype analysis, a total of eight haplotypes were observed in the entire population and the overall frequency distributions differed significantly between the HT and NT groups. Specifically, haplotype A-A-C (rs6356-rs6357-rs2070762) occurred only in the HT group and A-G-C occurred more commonly in HT subjects than in NT subjects (P=0.003 and P=0.013 respectively). Compared with the most common haplotype A-G-T, the adjusted OR (odds ratio) was 1.83 [95% CI (confidence interval), 1.20-2.79; P=0.0049] for haplotype G-G-C and 20 (P<0.0001) for the haplotype A-A-C. Functional analysis showed that the C allele of rs2070762 functioned as an enhancer in the absence of binding by unidentified transcriptional repressor(s). These results provide evidence for an association of the functional intronic rs2070762 with essential hypertension."
18204051,18204051,A common SNP of MCPH1 is associated with cranial volume variation in Chinese population.,"Microcephaly (MCPH) genes are informative in understanding the genetics and evolution of human brain volume. MCPH1 and abnormal spindle-like MCPH associated (ASPM) are the two known MCPH causing genes that were suggested undergone recent positive selection in human populations. However, previous studies focusing only on the two tag single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) of MCPH1 and ASPM failed to detect any correlation between gene polymorphisms and variations of brain volume and cognitive abilities. We conducted an association study on eight common SNPs of MCPH1 and ASPM in a Chinese population of 867 unrelated individuals. We demonstrate that a non-synonymous SNP (rs1057090, V761A in BRCA1 C-terminus (BRCT) domain) of MCPH1 other than the two known tag SNPs is significantly associated with cranial volume in Chinese males. The haplotype analysis confirmed the association of rs1057090 with cranial volume, and the homozygote males containing the derived alleles of rs1057090 have larger cranial volumes compared with those containing the ancestral alleles. No recent selection signal can be detected on this SNP, suggesting that the brain volume variation in human populations is likely neutral or under very weak selection in recent human history."
18167187,18167187,Osteopontin gene polymorphism in association with systemic lupus erythematosus in Chinese patients.,"Osteopontin (OPN) is one kind of cytokine which can play a number of roles in promoting activation of T lymphocyte, regulating balance between Th1 and Th2, participating in cell-induced immunologic response and stimulating B lymphocyte to express multi-clone antibodies. Some researches have showed that OPN may be involved in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The aim of this study was to investigate possible association of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 9250 in exon 7 of the OPN gene (OPN gene 9250) with SLE in Chinese patients."

18180757,18180757,A high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism screen of 23 candidate genes in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: suggesting multiple susceptibility genes among Chinese Han population.,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood-onset behavioral disorder with a definite genetic component. The search for genes predisposing to ADHD has focused on genes involved in the regulation of monoamine systems. In this study, we emphasized genes that underlie various aspects of dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmissions and performed a comprehensive association analysis by screening with 245 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 23 candidate genes in a sample of Chinese Han descent. A total of 182 DSM-IV ADHD children and 184 healthy controls were genotyped and analyzed with an average density of one SNP every 6.1 kb. Both single-SNP and multi-marker haplotype analyses were implemented to exploit association signal for ADHD and its diagnostic subtypes. Empirical P-values were derived on the basis of 5000 permutations to evaluate gene-wide statistical significance. MAOA yielded highly suggestive evidence of association (empirical P<0.01, OR=1.94) with ADHD. For inattentive ADHD, MAOA, DDC and SYP showed suggestive evidence of association (empirical P<0.05). ADRA2C achieved suggestive significance (empirical P<0.05) for ADHD combined type. Additionally, for six genes (SNAP25, NET1, DBH, CHRNA4, DRD3 and SYT1) we detected one or more SNPs with nominal P-values</=0.05. This study has identified several genes as promising susceptibility loci for ADHD. Replication efforts and further investigations remain necessary to provide definite proof of association."

18199708,18199708,Haplotype analyses of CYP19A1 gene variants and breast cancer risk: results from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study.,"Estrogens play a central role in the etiology of breast cancer. The CYP19A1 gene encodes aromatase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of estrogens. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) or haplotypes in the CYP19A1 gene have been evaluated in relation to breast cancer risk. However, the results have been inconsistent. In this study, we constructed haplotypes of the CYP19A1 gene using 19 haplotype-tagging SNPs in Chinese women and evaluated the variation of this gene in relation to breast cancer risk in a population-based case-control study involving 1,140 cases and 1,244 community controls of the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study. Five common haplotypes in block 1, three common haplotypes in block 2, five common haplotypes in block 3, and four common haplotypes in block 4 were identified. No apparent association was observed between common haplotypes and breast cancer risk in analyses including all subjects nor in analyses stratified by menopausal status. Similarly, no statistically significant differences were found between cases and controls in the genotype distributions of the 19 individual SNPs and the (TTTA)(n) repeat polymorphism evaluated in the study. No overall association of breast cancer risk with common CYP19A1 gene variants among Chinese women was observed in this large-scale, comprehensive study. Further studies are needed to explore CYP19A1 gene-environment interactions in relation to breast cancer risk."

Several studies have suggested that dysfunctions in the glutamatergic transmission are linked to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, and that the kainate ionotropic glutamate receptors are involved in this mechanism. A recent study provides cytogenetic and genetic evidence to support a role for the kainate-type glutamate receptor gene (GRIK4), in schizophrenia. A systematic case-control association study of GRIK4 involving a Scottish population found that three SNPs, rs4935752, rs6589846 and rs4430518, were associated with schizophrenia."
18063222,18063222,SORL1 haplotypes modulate risk of Alzheimer's disease in Chinese.,"Genetic variants of the neuronal sortilin-related receptor (SORL1) have been demonstrated to modulate the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in different American and European populations [Rogaeva, E., Meng, Y., Lee, J.H., Gu, Y., Kawarai, T., Zou, F., Katayama, T., Baldwin, C.T., Cheng, R., Hasegawa, H., Chen, F., Shibata, N., Lunetta, K.L., Pardossi-Piquard, R., Bohm, C., Wakutani, Y., Cupples, L.A., Cuenco, K.T., Green, R.C., Pinessi, L., Rainero, I., Sorbi, S., Bruni, A., Duara, R., Friedland, R.P., Inzelberg, R., Hampe, W., Bujo, H., Song, Y.Q., Andersen, O.M., Willnow, T.E., Graff-Radford, N., Petersen, R.C., Dickson, D., Der, S.D., Fraser, P.E., Schmitt-Ulms, G., Younkin, S., Mayeux, R., Farrer, L.A., St George-Hyslop, P., 2007. The neuronal sortilin-related receptor SORL1 is genetically associated with Alzheimer disease. Nat. Genet. 39 (2), 168-177]. We conducted haloptype analysis involving two genetic clusters of SORL1 in AD and controls among Han Chinese. rs3824968 (SNP 23) was associated with an increased risk of AD, and there was a trend towards association for rs1699102 (SNP 22) and rs2282649 (SNP 24). More robust associations were found for three-loci haplotypes. In particular, the GCA haplotype at SNPs 19-22-23 was associated with an increased risk (odds ratio 1.4), and CTC haplotype at SNPs 19-22-23 and TCT at SNPs 22-23-24 a decreased risk (odds ratio 0.67) of AD. The complete absence of some at-risk North European haplotypes in our Chinese study subjects was likely due to different ancestral origins, with allelic heterogeneity among races. However, our study suggests that certain SORL1 haplotypes at SNPs 19-24 modulated risk of AD in our Chinese population."

The results showed that there was significant difference in AA frequencies of genotype G+1688A polymorphism between case and control groups (39% vs 24%, P<0.001). A similar trend was observed on the allele frequencies (A/G: 62% vs 49%, P<0.001). Among the subjects with high serum total cholesterol level or high systolic blood pressure level, the variant AA genotype was associated with high risk of MI (adjusted OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.08-4.41 and adjusted OR, 2.53; 95%CI, 1.63-3.63). The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position +1688 in the exon 8 of PECAM-1 gene was associated with MI and the allele A might be a risk factor for MI in the Chinese Han population."
18197935,18197935,Association of CDH1 single nucleotide polymorphisms with susceptibility to esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and gastric cardia carcinomas.,"E-cadherin (CDH1) is a tumor suppressor involved in epithelial cell-cell interactions. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the CDH1 gene, -160C/A and -347G/GA in the 5'-promoter region and +54C/T in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) have been shown to be associated with tumor development and progression via modifying transcriptional activity, mRNA stability or protein expression. To investigate the influence of CDH1 SNP on susceptibility to esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC) and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas (GCA), a case-control study was conducted among 333 ESCC patients, 239 GCA patients and 343 controls from a northern Chinese population. CDH1 polymorphisms were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The results showed that; (i) genotypes with the +54C allele (C/C or C/T) significantly increased the risk of developing both ESCC and GCA compared to the +54T/T genotype (age and gender adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.45 and 2.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-1.99 and 1.58-3.30, respectively), and this association was significant only among non-smokers (OR = 1.68 and 2.64, 95% CI = 1.01-2.80 and 1.43-4.87 for ESCC and GCA, respectively), and individuals without a family history of upper gastrointestinal cancer (OR = 2.63 and 2.97, 95% CI = 1.36-5.10 and 95% CI = 1.32-6.68 for ESCC and GCA, respectively); (ii) compared with the -347G/G genotype, the -347GA and GA/GA genotypes significantly increased the risk of developing GCA (OR = 1.45, 95 % CI = 1.03-2.04); (iii) there was a significant association of CDH1-160C/-347G/+54C and -160C/-347GA/+54C haplotypes with the development of GCA, compared with the -160C/-347G/+54T haplotype (OR = 1.80 and 2.21, 95% CI = 1.33-2.44 and 1.43-3.42, respectively); and (iv) the influence of CDH1 SNP on the depth of tumor invasion and lymphatic metastasis in ESCC and GCA patients was not observed in this study. The present study indicates that CDH1 polymorphisms might modify susceptibility to ESCC and/or GCA."
24351585,24351585,Analysis of the relationship between three coding polymorphisms in LEPR gene and obesity in northern Chinese.,"To determine the effect of variants in LEPR gene on obesity in northern Chinese, three coding polymorphisms Arg109Lys (A/G), Asn656Lys (C/G) and Pro1019Pro (C/T) were investigated for association with overweight and obesity. By a case control design, 248 overweight or obese subjects and 351 lean normal controls were recruited in Harbin region in north China. All three polymorphisms were genotyped by Sequenom single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection system in both cases and controls. Genotypes for all three polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in control subjects. Both groups had similar distribution of alleles and genotypes created by the three coding polymorphisms of LEPR gene. No differences in frequencies of genotypes or alleles between cases and controls for any polymorphism individually were found by χ(2) analysis (p = 0.444, p = 0.507 and p = 0.662, respectively). Further, when the haplotypes of three polymorphisms were assessed, no association for any haplotype of three polymorphisms was revealed. In the present study, the three coding polymorphisms in LEPR gene were firstly investigated in a population of northern Chinese. It was suggested that the three coding polymorphisms in LEPR gene were unlikely to have major effects on susceptibility to obesity in northern Chinese.:"
18245884,18245884,[Genomic approaches to bone and joint diseases. Current status of genetic study of osteoarthritis].,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common human arthritis characterized by the degeneration of articular cartilage. OA is a major concern for aging societies worldwide. Epidemiological and genetic studies have revealed that OA is a polygenic disease. Growth differentiation factor 5 (GDF5 ) is a good candidate gene for OA. We have recently found a novel ENU-mutagenesis mouse that presents early onset OA in the elbow joint in homozygotes. Through case-control association studies, we have found that GDF5 is associated with OA in the Japanese population. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5'-UTR of GDF5 (+ 104T/C ; rs143383) showed a significant association (p = 1.8 x 10(- 13)) in hip OA. This association was replicated for knee OA in both Japanese and Han Chinese populations as well as in West European Caucasians. This SNP is located in the core promoter of GDF5 and exerted allelic differences on transcription, with the susceptibility allele showing reduced transcriptional activity. Our findings implicate GDF5 as a susceptibility gene for OA in worldwide populations and suggest that decreased GDF5 expression is involved in OA pathogenesis."
18034324,18034324,Association of the single-nucleotide polymorphism and haplotype of the P-selectin gene with ischemic stroke.,"Inflammation has recently proven to be associated with the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and inflammatory genes are good candidates for the risk of developing atherosclerosis. The early phase of atherosclerosis involves the recruitment of inflammatory cells from the circulation and their transendothelial migration. This process is mainly mediated by cellular adhesion molecules. The adhesion molecule P-selectin may play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Polymorphism of P-selectin gene, which may affect the production level of the adhesion molecule, has been associated with a number of atherosclerotic disease. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the relationship of P-selectin gene polymorphisms and ischemic stroke in a Chinese population. We analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms of P-selectin gene -2,123 G/C, -1,969 G/A, -1,817 T/C and Thr715Pro in three hundred and five patients with ischemic stroke and 280 age and sex matched controls, using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and DNA sequencing method. There were no significant differences in the genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies of P-selectin gene polymorphisms between the group of patients with ischemic stroke and the control group. Furthermore, there was no significant association of genotype, allele and haplotype at any of the polymorphism in relation to any subtype of ischemic stroke. We did not observe an association between P-selectin gene polymorphisms and ischemic stroke or any subtype of ischemic stroke. However, further studies are needed to explore the complex interaction between environmental factors and P-selectin gene polymorphisms in the risk of ischemic stroke, particularly in ethnically different populations."

17979508,17979508,Dopamine transporter polymorphisms and risperidone response in Chinese schizophrenia patients: an association study.,"Risperidone is a widely used atypical antipsychotic medication and there is currently considerable interest in individual differences in patient response to it. In this study, we investigated the pharmacogenetic correlates of SLC6A3 and response to risperidone treatment in 130 Chinese schizophrenia patients. We selected six polymorphisms, including two SNPs in the 5'-regulatory regions, two SNPs in intron 1, one SNP and a variable number tandem repeat in the 3'-flanking region of SLC6A3 for this study and analyzed the differences in the reduction of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores among the subgroups with different genotypes and diplotypes after 8 weeks of risperidone treatment. The confounding effects of nongenetic factors were estimated and the baseline symptom score was included as a covariate for adjustment. We found no significant differences in response to treatment in terms of PANSS or subscores improvements among the subgroups according to different genotypes and diplotypes. In addition, we have found no significant differences between different diplotypic groups in the plasma levels of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone. Further studies on larger groups and on the effects of longer-term risperidone treatment are needed to confirm these results."

18045615,18045615,Polymorphisms of Transferrin gene are associated with schizophrenia in Chinese Han population.,"Several recent studies have provided evidence that abnormalities in oligodendrocyte and myelin function may contribute to the etiopathology of schizophrenia. Transferrin (TF), an iron transport glycoprotein playing an important role in synthesis of myelin and the development of oligodendrocytes, has been identified as down-regulated expression in schizophrenia brain by microarray, quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization method. In order to further assess the role of TF in schizophrenia, we examined seven polymorphisms in TF region using a set sample of Chinese Han subjects consisting of 326 schizophrenia patients and 344 healthy controls. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) namely, rs4481157, rs3811655, rs6762415 and rs1405022 were analyzed in this study. Our results showed that one intronic SNP had strong association with schizophrenia (rs3811655: allele C>G, P=1.34E-6, OR=1.89, 95% CI=1.46-2.46; genotype P=3.72E-6). Two haplotypes A-C and G-G constructed of rs4481157-rs3811655 also revealed significant associations with schizophrenia (global P=0.0001). Our findings support that TF gene may be involved in susceptibility to schizophrenia in the Chinese Han population. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings in other populations and to identify functional variants in TF that may be implicated in pathogenesis."

The results provide further evidence that the SNP rs762178 in OLIG2 seems to be a potential candidate in altering risk for schizophrenia in the Chinese Han population and worthy of further replication and functional study."
17955477,17955477,The association analysis of RELN and GRM8 genes with autistic spectrum disorder in Chinese Han population.,"The region on chromosome 7q stands out as the region of suggestive linkage to aetiology of autism with the greatest concordance in many independent genome-wide scans. RELN and GRM8, the two genes selected in this study, are located within this region. The protein products of both genes are considered to play a pivotal role in the development of the central nervous system. In addition, biochemical and neuroanatomical data indicated that RELN and GRM8 genes are likely involved in the pathogenesis of autistic disorder. Therefore, both RELN and GRM8 genes are considered to be not only the positional but also the functional candidate genes to autism for association research. In this study, we genotyped 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within the RELN and GRM8 genes in 213 children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) and 160 controls. A significant genetic association between SNP2 (located in intron 59 of RELN) and ASD was observed, and the log-additive model was accepted as the best inheritance model fitting this data (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.54-0.97, P = 0.03). Haplotype-specific association analysis revealed that the result was consistent with the individual SNP study; the combination of SNP1/SNP2/SNP3/SNP4 which are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) (D' > 0.75) showed significant association with ASD (P = 0.027). Neither the single SNP nor the haplotype analysis showed significant association between ASD and the markers of GRM8 gene. Hence, our study suggested the possible involvement of RELN gene in the susceptibility to ASD. Future replications are warranted before definitive conclusion can be drawn."

17845306,17845306,Lack of association between three promoter polymorphisms of PTGDR gene and asthma in a Chinese Han population.,"The PTGDR gene has been suggested to be an asthma susceptibility gene in previous genome-wide linkage studies as well as in functional studies in a mouse model of asthma. Recently, promoter polymorphisms of the PTGDR gene have been reported to be associated with asthma in American and European populations. In order to determine the association of PTGDR promoter polymorphisms and asthma susceptibility in a Chinese Han population, three promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) -549T/C, -441C/T, and -197T/C were genotyped in 336 patients with asthma and 264 healthy controls. Asthma was diagnosed according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria. SNPs -549T/C and -441C/T were genotyped by Tetra-primer Amplification Refractory Mutation System PCR method and -197T/C by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Unlike the results observed in American and European populations, none of the three SNPs nor any haplotypes in the PTGDR promoter region were found to be associated with asthma susceptibility in this Chinese Han population (all P-value > 0.05). The frequencies for both high-transcriptional-efficiency haplotype (CCC) and low-transcriptional-efficiency haplotype (TCT) were lower than 1% in patients and controls, significantly different from those observed in American and European populations. These results suggest that the three PTGDR gene promoter polymorphisms studied are not important risk factors for asthma susceptibility in the Chinese Han population."

17720627,17720627,Single nucleotide polymorphism and haplotype association of the interleukin-8 gene with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,"The cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) may play a role in the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) through the modulation of tumor immune response or enhanced angiogenesis. Polymorphism of IL-8 gene, which may affect the production level of cytokine, has been inversely associated with a number of cancers. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the relationship of IL-8 gene polymorphisms and NPC in a Chinese population. We analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL-8 gene -845 T/C, -738 T/A, -353 A/T, -251 A/T and +678 T/C in 280 patients with NPC and 290 age and sex matched controls, using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primers method (PCR-SSP). There were significant differences in the genotype and allele distribution of -251 A/T polymorphism of the IL-8 gene among cases and controls. The -251 AA and AT genotypes were associated with a significantly increased risk of NPC as compared with the -251 TT genotypes (OR=1.820, 95% CI, 1.120-2.959, P=0.015 and OR=1.590, 95% CI, 1.104-2.290, P=0.013, respectively). Haplotype analysis revealed that the homozygosity of the AAT haplotype (defined by SNPs at positions -353, -251 and +678) of IL-8 gene conveys the highest risk for NPC compared with the homozygosity for the TTC haplotype (OR=1.396; 95% CI, 1.064-1.831; P=0.016). The -251 A/T polymorphism of IL-8 and its haplotype are associated with NPC in a Chinese population. Our data suggests that IL-8 gene may play a role in the development of NPC."

17687619,17687619,The association of common polymorphisms in the QPCT gene with bone mineral density in the Chinese population.,"Evidence of the linkage of chromosome 2p to bone mineral density (BMD) has previously been reported in multiple populations. However, the identification of the BMD quantitative trait loci (QTL) gene at chromosome 2p remains a challenge. We performed a gene-wide and tag single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based association study of four positional and functional candidate genes (CALM2, CYP1B1, QPCT, and POMC) in a sample of 1,243 cases and matched controls. Thirteen HapMap tag SNPs were selected and genotyped by using the high-throughput Sequenom genotyping platform. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to test for associations between each SNP genotype and BMD. Haplotype association analyses were performed by WHAP. The rs3770748 within the QPCT gene showed a significant association with spine BMD in both single-marker (P = 0.002) and haplotype association analyses (P = 0.0482 for the global test; P = 0.00092 for the haplotype-specific test). Subgroup analysis revealed that the effect was primarily driven by an association in the postmenopausal women, presumably suggesting that the rs3770748 affects postmenopausal bone loss rather than peak bone mass. Our results suggest that QPCT may be the QTL gene at chromosome 2p for spine BMD variation in the Chinese population."
17657167,17657167,Lack of association between the BDNF gene Val66Met polymorphism and Alzheimer disease in a Chinese Han population.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by excessive neuronal loss in specific regions of the brain. Among the areas most severely affected are the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and their projection regions, the hippocampus and the cortex. Several lines of evidence have made brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) an important candidate gene conferring risk for AD. Recently, several reports investigated the association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (Val66Met, rs6265) of the BDNF gene and AD but yielded ambiguous results. To figure out the association of this single nucleotide polymorphism in the BDNF gene with sporadic AD in a Chinese Han population, we analyzed 513 patients with AD and 575 controls for the genetic association studies. Our results indicated that the distribution of the BDNF genotypes and alleles did not differ significantly. Similar results were observed when the AD and control groups were stratified by age/age at onset and sex. Our data also showed that in the Chinese Han population, the frequencies of the BDNF Met allele (46.5%) and Val allele (53.5%) were significantly different from ethnic groups from Italy, Japan and the USA. The present data revealed no significant effect of the genotypes on the age at onset for developing AD, and no significant association between the genotypes and the severity of the disease."
17652958,17652958,A differential association of ALOX15 polymorphisms with bone mineral density in pre- and post-menopausal women.,The 12/15-lipoxygenase gene ALOX15 is reported to be a negative regulator of BMD in knockout mice. Nonetheless results are controversial as over-expression of ALOX15 protects against inflammation-related bone loss. The aim of the present study is to systematically study the relation of ALOX15 polymorphisms in BMD variation in southern Chinese women.
17625508,17625508,VEGF C-634G polymorphism is associated with protection from isolated ventricular septal defect: case-control and TDT studies.,"The ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common congenital heart defect and no candidate susceptibility gene has been identified. Endocardial cushion and outflow septal morphogenesis, malalignment of which induces VSD, have been suggested to be mediated by the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Three single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants in promoter and 5'-UTR region of the VEGF gene, C-2578A (rs699947), G-1154A (rs1570360) and G-634C (rs2010963), were reported to alter its expression. We assessed the association in a Chinese population between these SNPs and VSD using a double approach: case-control and TDT designs. Among the three SNPs, only -634C allele was less frequently present in 222 patients compared to 352 controls (odds ratio: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59-0.97, X(2)=5.06, P=0.024, not significant after a Bonferroni correction). This was significantly less transmitted to VSD patients (trios: 142) (odds ratio: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.25-0.62, X(2)=8.11, df=1, P=0.004, corrected P=0.024). A similar result was observed for haplotype -2578C/-1154G/-634C allele in both studies (in TDT: X(2)=7.51, df=1, P=0.006, corrected P=0.048). All these associations for the first time demonstrated that -634C allele was in a significant protective association against VSD, suggesting that VEGF dysregulation was involved in the pathological processes of VSD."

17618444,17618444,The interferon-gamma receptor gene polymorphisms (Val14Met and Gln64Arg) are not associated with systemic lupus erythematosus in Chinese patients.,"Genetic polymorphism is a difference in DNA sequence among individuals, groups, or populations that give rise to different forms. Differences in DNA sequences that occur naturally in a population. Single nucleotide substitutions, insertions and deletions of nucleotides and repetitive sequences (microsatellites) are all examples of polymorphism. The position at which such a sequence difference is found is a polymorphic site. A single nucleotide substitution is called a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). SNPs can occur in coding parts of the gene. If they result in genetic code change, amino-acid polymorphism would occur. The heterodimeric IFN-gamma receptor (IFNGR) complex was made up of two receptor subunits including IFNGR-1 and IFNGR-2. There exist five dbSNP alleles in IFNGR1 exon region and six dbSNP alleles in IFNGR2. Some researchers had found that the greatest risk of the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) be detected in the individuals who had the Met14/Val14 genotype or the combination of IFNGR1 Met14/Val14 genotype and IFNGR2 Gln64/Gln64 genotype in Japanese patients. So we aimed to assess the association between two polymorphisms within the IFNGR gene (A88G and A839G) and SLE in Chinese patients. This study included 154 patients with SLE and 159 unrelated healthy controls. We examined the IFNGR genotype by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-single-strand conformation polymorphism method, RT-PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method and DNA sequencing. Genotype frequencies between SLE patients and controls were compared and relationship between genotype frequencies and clinical manifestations of SLE were evaluated. We found that IFNGR2 Arg64/Arg64 genotype decrease the risk of SLE (OR = 2.326, 95% CI 1.181-4.581, Fisher P = 0.015), and the same as IFNGR2 Arg64/Arg64 genotype and IFNGR1 Val14/Val14 genotype combination (OR = 2.420, 95% CI 1.206-4.854, Fisher P = 0.013). The allelic frequency of Val14/Met14 is significantly higher in the patients with oral ulcer or thrombocytopenia when compared with patient without these clinical feature (OR = 4.630, 95% CI 1.370-15.640, Fisher P = 0.021; or OR = 6.368, 95% CI 2.009-20.191, Fisher P = 0.003). On the contrary, the allelic frequency of Val14/Val14 is lower in the patients with oral ulcer or thrombocytopenia than those without these clinical feature (OR = 0.216, 95% CI 0.064-0.730, Fisher P = 0.021; or OR = 0.157, 95% CI 0.050-0.498, Fisher P = 0.003). And after data analysis, we also find that the allelic frequency of Gln64/Gln64 is lower in the patients with arthritis when compared with patient without arthritis (OR = 0.369, 95% CI 0.166-0.818, Fisher P = 0.017). We can conclude that the IFNGR polymorphisms (Val14Met and Gln64Arg) are protective in SLE in Chinese patients. We describe a novel association between Val14/Met14 carriage and patients with oral ulcer or thrombocytopenia."
17604122,17604122,"A quantitative association study between schizotypal traits and COMT, PRODH and BDNF genes in a healthy Chinese population.","Previous studies have suggested that catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), proline dehydrogenase (PRODH), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) genes are possible susceptibility genes for schizophrenia. We hypothesized that these genes are also associated with schizotypal traits, which are heritable and related to schizophrenia. We genotyped five single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) from the COMT, PRODH and BDNF genes, and performed a series of association analyses between alleles, genotypes or haplotypes, and quantitative schizotypal trait scores derived from the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ), in 465 Chinese healthy subjects. We found that 'years of education' was a major influence on seven out of nine schizotypal components, three schizotypal factors and the total SPQ scores. Molecular genetic analysis of COMT, PRODH and BDNF genes showed no significant effects of any variants on schizotypal components or factors of SPQ after correction for multiple testing, although there were weak association between COMT Val158Met (rs4680G/A) and the odd speech subscale (allele-wise, P=0.04; genotype-wise, P=0.049), between COMT Val158Met (rs4680G/A) and the suspiciousness subscale (genotype-wise, P=0.024), and between BDNF Val66Met and the Factor 2 interpersonal measure (genotype-wise, P=0.027) before correction. Furthermore, we found SNP Val158Met (rs4680) of the COMT gene significantly influenced the scores of some of schizotypal traits including total SPQ score, the disorganization factor and the constricted affect subscale in male subjects only. However, the effect was in the opposite direction of an earlier association with the SPQ reported by Avramopoulos et al. [Avramopoulos, D., Stefanis, N.C., Hantoumi, I., Smyrnis, N., Evdokimidis, I., Stefanis, C.N., 2002. Higher scores of self reported schizotypy in healthy young males carrying the COMT high activity allele. Molecular Psychiatry 7, 706-711]. We conclude that SNP Val158Met (rs4680) in the COMT gene may be associated with some schizotypal traits in male subjects, but our results are not conclusive."
24573875,24573875,Association of the genetic polymorphism of EPHX1 and EPHX2 with the susceptibility to chronic benzene poisoning.,"The aim of this study was to explore the association of the genetic polymorphism of EPHX1 and EPHX2 with the susceptibility to chronic benzene poisoning (CBP). A case-control study of 268 patients with CBP and 268 healthy workers matched by age and sex, all of whom were occupationally exposed to benzene, was conducted. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, rs2854451, rs3738047, rs2234922 and rs1051741) of EPHX1 gene and the SNP (rs751141) of EPHX2 gene were tested by the TaqMan PCR method. In the subjects carrying the genotype of EPHX1 rs3738047 GG, the risk of CBP was decreased in the individuals simultaneously carrying EPHX1 rs2234922 G (P = 0.02). Alternatively, in the subjects carrying the genotype of EPHX1 rs2234922 AA, the risk of CBP was increased in the individuals simultaneously carrying the allele of EPHX2 rs751141A (P = 0.03). It was also found that there were potential interactions between alcohol consumption and the polymorphism of EPHX1 rs1051741 (χH (2) = 5.28, P = 0.02) or rs2234922 (χH (2) = 6.71, P = 0.01). Compared to individuals with EPHX1 rs1051741 CC or rs2234922 AA genotype in the drinkers, the risk of CBP in those carrying genotypes of EPHX1 rs1051741 CT+TT or rs2234922 AG+GG was decreased, respectively (P = 0.04, P < 0.01). Haplotype analysis of polymorphisms in EPHX1 showed that the risk of CBP was increased in the subjects with haplotype 2 (rs2854451-A, rs3738047-G, rs2234922-A, rs1051741-C) or haplotype 4 (rs2854451-G, rs3738047-A, rs2234922-G, rs1051741-T), but decreased in those with haplotype 6 (rs2854451-G, rs3738047-G, rs2234922-G, rs1051741-T) or haplotype 10 (rs2854451-A, rs3738047-A, rs2234922-G, rs1051741-T), respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking might play a role in modifying the risk of CBP (OR = 0.313, 95% CI: 0.123-0.794, P = 0.015). The genetic polymorphism in EPHX1 may be associated with the risk of CBP in the Chinese occupational population and further research is needed for the association between the genetic polymorphism in EPHX2 and the susceptibility to CBP."

17588132,17588132,Deoxyribonuclease I gene polymorphism in Han Chinese population: frequency and effect on glucose and lipid parameters.,"DNASE1, the encoding gene of deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I), exhibits polymorphisms, including a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP A2317G) in exon 8 and a 56 bp variable number of tandem repeat, designated as HumDN1 in intron 4. Several different ethnic population studies have revealed both A2317G and HumDN1 demonstrate genetic heterogeneity in the worldwide distribution. Recently, G2317 allele was proposed as an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction in Japanese population. In the present study, we identified A2317G and HumDN1 genotypes in 402 unrelated healthy Han Chinese individuals. At the same time, the impact of different genotypes and diplotypes of DNase I on plasma lipids levels and fasting blood glucose was also illuminated. Polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism were used for the detection of HumDN1 and A2317G polymorphisms. Plasma glucose and lipids were measured in fasting state by biochemical methods. Three genotypes of A2317G and 9 genotypes of HumDN1 were detected in Han Chinese population. Among them, the most predominate alleles were A2317 (frequency = 53.6%) and HumDN1*3 (frequency = 47.4%) respectively. Linkage disequilibrium between A2317G and HumDN1 polymorphisms was also observed (D' = 0.717). Haplotype A-3, presented in frequency of 46.5%, was most common. Compared to other ethnic populations, Han Chinese had its own unique DNase I gene distribution characteristics. As for the influence of DNase I gene polymorphisms on lipids and glucose levels, no association was found between either genotype or diplotype and these parameters. (all P > 0.05). Results obtained in this study could be used for anthropological investigation, probing into relations between DNase I gene and diseases."

17554368,17554368,Polymorphisms in interleukin-15 gene on chromosome 4q31.2 are associated with psoriasis vulgaris in Chinese population.,"Through a series of linkage analyses in a large Chinese family cohort of psoriasis, we previously identified and confirmed a non-HLA psoriasis linkage locus PSORS9 within a small region at 4q31.2-32.1. Within the critical region of the PSORS9 locus, IL-15 has been long recognized as a strong candidate gene for psoriasis. In this study, we investigated the association between IL-15 genetic polymorphisms and psoriasis in a large Chinese sample. Highly significant evidence for association was identified at a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (g.96516A --> T) within the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the IL-15 gene (P=0.00006, after correction for multiple testing). Haplotype analysis using the SNPs within the 3'UTR region also provided strong supporting evidence for association (P=0.00005), where we identified a haplotype of the 3'UTR region of IL-15 associated with increased risk to psoriasis (odds ratio=1.65). This association was also supported by the results of our expression activity analyses, where we demonstrated that the identified risk haplotype is associated with an increased activity of IL-15. Therefore, we provided early evidence for the important role of IL-15 genetic variants in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, probably by increasing interleukin production and inflammation in the lesions of psoriasis."
17529905,17529905,Functional significance of the TLR4/11367 polymorphism identified in Chinese Han population.,"Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is the central signaling receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mammals. This study was designed to investigate the functional significance of the G11367C polymorphism, which is a novel variant we identified in the 3' untranslated region of TLR4 gene in Chinese Han population. Three hundred seventy healthy volunteers were selected. The TLR4/11367 polymorphism was genotyped using single-tube bidirectional allele-specific amplification method. The TLR4 protein expression on peripheral leukocytes and plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha levels were determined by means of flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The post-transcriptional effect of the 11367 polymorphism was evaluated by means of reporter gene assay and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The G11367C polymorphism is a common allele in Chinese Han population, with minor allele frequency of 14.7%. In response to ex vivo LPS stimulation, the TLR4 expression on the surface of peripheral leukocytes and the plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha levels were significantly lower in carriers of 11367C variant allele than in carriers of 11367G allele. This association was allele dose dependent. We also found that the activity and the mRNA expression of luciferase was significantly smaller in human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with construct containing 11367C allele than in those transfected with construct containing 11367G allele. Together, these results suggest that the TLR4/11367 polymorphism may be a functional single nucleotide polymorphism, which could attenuate the LPS-induced transmembrane signaling through the alteration of post-transcriptional regulation of 3' untranslated region and target gene expression."
17507620,17507620,Polymorphisms in the CYP19A1 (aromatase) gene and endometrial cancer risk in Chinese women.,"Aromatase, encoded by the CYP19A1 gene, is a key enzyme in estradiol biosynthesis, which catalyzes the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone to estrone and estradiol, respectively. Given the critical role of estrogen in the development of endometrial cancer risk, we evaluated genetic polymorphisms of the CYP19A1 gene, including rs1065779, rs700519, rs28566535, rs752760, and rs1870050, in association with endometrial cancer in a population-based case-control study conducted in Shanghai, China. Genotypes of 1,040 incident endometrial cancer cases and 1,031 frequency-matched controls were included in the study. We applied a logistic regression model to derive adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Six common haplotypes with a frequency >or=5% were estimated; the highest frequency haplotype was GCACA (27.8% in cases and 26.2% in controls). We observed an inverse association between CYP19A1 haplotype TCATC and endometrial cancer in our population (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62-0.92). An inverse association was found between endometrial cancer and single nucleotide polymorphism rs1870050 in the promoter region with ORs of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.68-0.97) and 0.58 (95% CI, 0.42-0.80) for the AC and CC genotypes, respectively. We observed a multiplicative interaction between single nucleotide polymorphism rs700519 and body mass index among postmenopausal women (P = 0.01), with stronger associations between rs700519 genotypes and endometrial cancer risk among heavier (body mass index, >or=25) postmenopausal women. In summary, our data show that polymorphisms in the CYP19A1 gene may contribute to endometrial carcinogenesis."
17479402,17479402,Identification and functional characterization of JWA polymorphisms and their association with risk of gastric cancer and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in a Chinese population.,"Recently, a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter of the JWA gene (-76G --> C) was identified that may alter the transcription activity and thus play a role in increased risk of bladder cancer. In this study, a screen for more novel variants in the JWA exons was undertaken by using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) followed by a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method and evaluating the functions of newl identified JWA -76G --> C using the reporter gene assay. In addition to the -76G --> C polymorphism, another novel SNP (723T --> G) in exon 3 of JWA was identified. In a case-control study of these two SNPs in 413 gastric cancer and 250 esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients and 814 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population, data showed that both SNPs were associated with enhanced risk of these cancers. The reporter gene assay showed that the -76C variant allele lost its response to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) exposure, compared to the -76G allele. In addition, the JWA -76C allele was found to be associated with increased gastric and esophageal cancer risks in this study population. Further studies are needed to substantiate the biological significance and related mechanisms underlying the associations."

The JWA gene also produced a marked effect during chemical-induced multidirectional differentiations of primary and human myeloid leukemia cells. Recently, a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon2 of the JWA gene (454CA) was identified that may play a role in risk of bladder cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the 454CA (NM_006407.2) in JWA exon2 variants and risk of leukemia in a hospital-based case-control study of 202 leukemia patients and 289 cancer-free controls. Results indicated that 454A allele was found to associate with significantly increased risk of leukemia, although the 454CA is a synonymous polymorphism in coding region of the JWA gene. In conclusion, the potentially functional genetic polymorphism 454CA of the JWA gene appears to contribute to the risk of multiple kinds of leukemia in a south Chinese population."

The aim of this study was to search for other gene(s) associated with AS independently of HLA-B27 using 13 microsatellite markers spanning 1.5 Mb from locus TAP1 to HLA-Cw and a single-nucleotide polymorphism marker within NFkappaBIL1 gene promoter. Genotyping for microsatellites was performed in 175 AS patients of eastern Chinese and 219 ethnically matched healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction with fluorescence-labelled primers, whereas the SNP marker was genotyped by direct DNA sequencing. Allele as well as haplotype frequencies were compared between cases and controls, and a linkage disequilibrium analysis was performed to estimate the LD relationship between the candidate regions. The frequencies of alleles D6S2811*128, STR_MICA*A5.1 and D6S2672*109, as well as haplotypes D6S2811*128-D6S2927*213-D6S2810*340, D6S2927* 221-D6S2810*350-MICA*A5.1, and D6S2810*350-MICA*A5.1-D6S2800* 136 were significantly increased in B27-positive AS patients when compared with B27-positive controls.

Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs: rs4680, rs165656 and rs165774), in the cathechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, were genotyped by PCR-RFLP method. Individual SNP analysis shows significant differences only at SNP rs165656 for both genotype and allele frequency when comparing MR cases and controls (p=0.023, 0.011, respectively). Further haplotype analysis indicates that there are two haplotype sets, rs165656-rs4680 and rs165656-rs165774, which show statistical differences between MR cases and controls (global p=0.047, p=0.033, respectively).

17408692,17408692,No association found between the promoter variants of ADRA1A and schizophrenia in the Chinese population.,"Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatry disorder with a strong genetic component. A recent association study of alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor gene (ADRA1A) involving an isolated Spanish population, focusing on the promoter region of the ADRA1A, genotyped eight single SNPs at the promoter region of ADRA1A and found that two SNPs, -563G/A and -9625G/A, were associated with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders. We were interested in the two positive sites reported and selected five variants among the promoter region of ADRA1A, namely -563G/A, -9625G/A, -2760C/A, -4155G/C and a new substitution we detected between -508bp and -530bp upstream of the translation initiation site. Our sample consisted of 480 schizophrenia and 480 control subjects. All recruits were Han Chinese in Shanghai origin. However, neither individual SNP nor any haplotype was associated with schizophrenia in our study. These results suggest that the variants among the promoter of ADRA1A gene are unlikely to play a major role in the susceptibility to schizophrenia in the Chinese population."

We studied three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, rs10917661, rs5017567, and rs1050499) encoding non-synonymous substitution in the FcgammaRIIB gene with respect to genetic susceptibility to SLE in collection of 435 subjects from 95 nuclear families. We performed the genotyping using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Among 119 SLE patients, the frequencies of FcgammaRIIB Gln/Gln,Gln/Ter and Ter/Ter genotypes were 12.7, 60.7 and 26.6%. Univariate (single-marker) family-based association tests (FBATs) demonstrated that variant alleles at a SNP, rs10917661, in exon 2 of FcgammaRIIB gene were significantly associated with genetic susceptibility to SLE in additive model (exon 2, Z = 3.444, P = 0.00057). transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) and sibship disequilibuium test (SDT) analysis showed an excess of the alleles of 50Ter from heterozygous parents to affected offspring (chi(2) = 10.88, P = 0.0013). However, the rs5017567 and rs1050499 SNPs were not found in Chinese population. Our findings provide strong evidence suggesting that a FcgammaRIIB-Gln50Ter loci might be the susceptible factor of SLE in Chinese population."

17327457,17327457,Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) sequence polymorphisms in type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetic traits.,"Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) is located within the region of linkage to type 2 diabetes on chromosome 1q21-q23 and is a key activator of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. We evaluated 78 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning >213 kb in 95 people, from which we selected 64 SNPs for evaluation in 191 Caucasian case subjects from Utah and between 165 and 188 control subjects. Six SNPs showed nominal associations with type 2 diabetes (P = 0.001-0.04), including the nonsynonymous SNP rs1058405 (M67V) in exon 3 and rs11579627 in the 3' flanking region. Only rs1159627 remained significant on permutation testing. The associations were not replicated in 353 African-American case subjects and 182 control subjects, nor were ATF6 SNPs associated with altered insulin secretion or insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic Caucasian individuals. No association with type 2 diabetes was found in a subset of 44 SNPs in Caucasian (n = 2,099), Pima Indian (n = 293), and Chinese (n = 287) samples. Allelic expression imbalance was found in transformed lymphocyte cDNA for 3' untranslated region variants, thus suggesting cis-acting regulatory variants. ATF6 does not appear to play a major role in type 2 diabetes, but further work is required to identify the cause of the allelic expression imbalance."

17318641,17318641,Common variation in KLKB1 and essential hypertension risk: tagging-SNP haplotype analysis in a case-control study.,"The human plasma kallikrein gene (KLKB1) encodes plasma kallikrein, a serine protease that catalyzes the release of kinins and other vasoactive peptides and may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension. In this study, we performed a haplotype-based study to assess the effect of common genetic variation in the KLKB1 gene on the risk of essential hypertension. Eight common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected from the HapMap database and used to determine the pattern of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype structure within the KLKB1 gene. Four tag SNPs were then identified with over 85% power to predict both common haplotypes and remaining common SNPs, and genotyped in 1,317 cases with essential hypertension and 1,269 healthy controls. Single SNP analyses indicated that SNPs rs2304595 and rs4253325 were significantly associated with hypertension, adjusted for covariates. Compared with the most common Hap2 CAGC, Hap1 AGAC and Hap3 CGAC, which carry the susceptible rs2304595 G allele and rs4253325 A allele, were found to significantly increase the risk of essential hypertension with adjusted odds ratios equal to 1.37 and 1.17, respectively (P < 0.0001 and 0.028). A strongly significant interaction with gene-drinking was also observed. Among drinkers, the adjusted OR for Hap1 relative to Hap2 was increased to 2.50 (95% CI, 2.40 to 2.61; P < 0.0001). This was the first study to perform association analysis of the KLKB1 gene with essential hypertension. Our findings suggested that common genetic variation in the KLKB1 gene might contribute to the risk of hypertension in the northern Han Chinese population."

It was found that the TT allelic genotype of NOS2 C-1173T associated with the highest RPH and TT allelic genotype of NOS3 G894T associated with the highest APH in HPS spectral parameters. This suggests the SNPs of NOS2 C-1173T and NOS3 G894T may be the deep layer factors to result in the variability of HPS spectral parameters."
17270896,17270896,Association of beta-adrenoceptor single nucleotide polymorphisms with resting heart rate.,"The association of beta-adrenoceptor (B-AR, including three subgroups: Beta1, Beta2 and Beta3) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with resting heart rate (RHR) were analyzed. RHR of 107 healthy subjects in the supine were detected by computerized system for 8 minutes. Genotyping SNPs of S/G49 and R/G389 of Beta1-AR and W/R64 of Beta3-AR in these subjects were by means of PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. Genotyping SNPs of R/G16 and Q/E27 of Beta1-adrenoceptor in these subjects were by means of allele specific primer-PCR (ASP-PCR) technique. It was found that there was no significant difference among RHRs corresponding above SNPs of B-AR, but the SNP of R/G389 of Beta1-AR, in which there was significant difference among RHRs (P<0.05). Either in the female individuals or in the male, those with Beta1-AR G/G389 genotype had the highest RHR. The females with R/R389 genotype had the lowest RHR, however, the males with R/G389 genotype had the lowest RHR. The RHR was not only associated with R/G389 polymorphism of Beta1-adrenoceptor gene significantly, but also was associated with gender in Chinese."

17223993,17223993,The alpha(1S) subunit of the L-type calcium channel is not a predisposition gene for thyrotoxic periodic paralysis.,Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TTP) has been associated with genetic variations in the gene encoding the alpha 1 subunit of the L-type calcium channel (CACNA1S). Mutations in CACNA1S are known to account for the majority of cases of familial hypokalaemic periodic paralysis (HOKPP). In this study we have examined 48 genetic polymorphisms in the CACNA1S gene and genotyped a tagging set of representative polymorphisms to determine the role of this gene in TPP.
17412563,17412563,"Systematic study of association of four GABAergic genes: glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 gene, glutamic acid decarboxylase 2 gene, GABA(B) receptor 1 gene and GABA(A) receptor subunit beta2 gene, with schizophrenia using a universal DNA microarray.","Several studies have suggested the dysfunction of the GABAergic system as a risk factor in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. In the present study, case-control association analysis was conducted in four GABAergic genes: two glutamic acid decarboxylase genes (GAD1 and GAD2), a GABA(A) receptor subunit beta2 gene (GABRB2) and a GABA(B) receptor 1 gene (GABBR1). Using a universal DNA microarray procedure we genotyped a total of 20 SNPs on the above four genes in a study involving 292 patients and 286 controls of Chinese descent. Statistically significant differences were observed in the allelic frequencies of the rs187269C/T polymorphism in the GABRB2 gene (P=0.0450, chi(2)=12.40, OR=1.65) and the -292A/C polymorphism in the GAD1 gene (P=0.0450, chi(2)=14.64 OR=1.77). In addition, using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we discovered differences in the U251 nuclear protein binding to oligonucleotides representing the -292 SNP on the GAD1 gene, which suggests that the -292C allele has reduced transcription factor binding efficiency compared with the 292A allele. Using the multifactor-dimensionality reduction method (MDR), we found that the interactions among the rs187269C/T polymorphism in the GABRB2 gene, the -243A/G polymorphism in the GAD2 gene and the 27379C/T and 661C/T polymorphisms in the GAD1 gene revealed a significant association with schizophrenia (P<0.001). These findings suggest that the GABRB2 and GAD1 genes alone and the combined effects of the polymorphisms in the four GABAergic system genes may confer susceptibility to the development of schizophrenia in the Chinese population."
17216495,17216495,CYP19A1 polymorphisms are associated with bone mineral density in Chinese men.,"Aromatase-dependent biosynthesis of estrogen plays an important role in maintenance of the male skeleton, and Cytochrome p450 aromatase is the key enzyme to catalyze the conversion of androgen precursors to estrogens. We investigated the association of polymorphisms in the CYP19A1 gene and bone mineral density in a Chinese cohort. 2392 extreme low femoral neck BMD cases or extreme high femoral neck BMD controls were selected from a population-based cohort and genotyped for eight SNPs in the CYP19A1 gene. Significant associations for rs17703883, rs12594287 and rs16964201 SNPs with BMD were found in men only. Men with TC/CC genotypes in the rs17703883 SNP had a 1.5 times higher risk of having extreme low femoral neck BMD (P = 0.003, empirical P value = 0.05), and decreased BMDs at total body (P = 0.004, empirical P value = 0.07) and total hip (P = 0.003, empirical P value = 0.05). Men carrying AA/AG genotypes in the rs12594287 SNP had a 30% reduced risk of having extreme low femoral neck BMD (P = 0.007, empirical P value = 0.12), and increased BMDs at total body (P = 0.0009, empirical P value = 0.018) and total hip (P = 0.001, empirical P value = 0.02). Men carrying TT/TC genotypes in the rs16964201 SNP had a 40% reduced risk of having extreme low femoral neck BMD (P = 0.005, empirical P value = 0.087), and increased BMDs at total body (P = 0.0001, empirical P value = 0.002) and total hip (P = 0.0006, empirical P value = 0.012). Haplotype analysis showed that the G-C-T-A-T haplotype was significantly related to higher BMD. Our finding suggests that genetic variations in the CYP19A1 gene are significantly associated with BMD at different skeletal sites in adult men, but not in women."
17220213,17220213,Phenotypic and population differences in the association between CILP and lumbar disc disease.,"Lumbar disc disease (LDD) is one of the leading causes of disability in the working-age population.

17117951,17117951,Absence of association between two insertion/deletion coding genetic polymorphisms of TIM-1 gene and asthma in Chinese Han population.,"TIM-1, a member of T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain (TIM) gene family, was implicated as an asthma susceptibility gene in previous studies. TIM-1 was expressed on CD4(+) T cells after activation and its expression was sustained preferentially in T-helper type 2 (T(H)2) but not in T(H)1 cells, therefore TIM-1 became a good candidate gene for atopic diseases. Recent studies indicated that two insertion/deletion (ins/del) coding genetic polymorphisms in exon 4 of TIM-1 were associated with asthma susceptibility in some but not in all populations. In order to investigate the relationship between TIM-1 genetic polymorphisms and asthma in Chinese Han population, we performed a case-control study for two insertion/deletion polymorphisms in TIM-1 exon 4 (5383_5397ins/del and 5509_5511delCAA) and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in intron 8 (IVS 8+9 G/A) between a healthy control group of 309 people and an asthma patient group of 352 people recruited from Chinese Han population. The polymorphisms were genotyped and the allele and genotype frequencies were analysed, but none of the three polymorphisms showed association with asthma susceptibility in single-locus association analyses. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analyses demonstrated that the two insertion/deletion polymorphisms were in strong LD but the haplotypes constructed from these two polymorphisms showed no significant association with asthma. In conclusion, our findings suggest that 5383_5397ins/del, 5509_5511delCAA and SNP IVS 8+9 G/A polymorphisms are not associated with asthma susceptibility in Chinese Han population."
17049558,17049558,Identification of rare mutations of synaptogyrin 1 gene in patients with schizophrenia.,"Synaptogyrin 1 gene (SYNGR1) is considered as a positional candidate gene for schizophrenia because of its location at chromosome 22q13, a region linked to schizophrenia, and its reduced expression in postmortem brain of patients with schizophrenia. Additionally, genetic studies also reported association of SYNGR1 is with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in southern India. Prompted by these findings, we were interested to know if SYNGR1 is also associated with schizophrenia in our population. Therefore, we systematically searched for SYNGR1 mutations in a cohort of Han Chinese patients from Taiwan. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, including three at the putative core promoter region (g.-673A>C, g.-377G>A and g.-318G>T) that are in strong linkage disequilibrium and one in intron 2 (IVS2-64C>G). Computer program predicts that g.-637A>C and g.318G>T may change transcription binding sites of AP-1 and TGT3, respectively. We further carried out SNP- and haplotype-based case-control association studies of these tress SNPs with schizophrenia. However, no association was detected between these SNPs and schizophrenia in our sample. Nevertheless, we identified several rare mutations in exon 6 of SYNGR1 gene in our patient cohort (n=497), including a 3-bp (AAC) in-frame insertion between codon 202 and 203 (P202_T203insN) in two patients, an A-to-G missense mutation (c.665A>G) at codon 222 (D222G) in one patient, a synonymous mutation (c.669C>T) at codon 223 (T223T) in one patient, and a C-to-T at 3' UTR of SYNGR1 (c.772C>T) in one patient. These are mutations were not found in 507 control subjects, suggesting further functional assays are warranted to verify their relevance to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia."
17053108,17053108,HTRA1 promoter polymorphism in wet age-related macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of irreversible vision loss in individuals aged older than 50 years, is classified as either wet (neovascular) or dry (nonneovascular). Inherited variation in the complement factor H gene is a major risk factor for drusen in dry AMD. Here we report that a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of HTRA1, a serine protease gene on chromosome 10q26, is a major genetic risk factor for wet AMD. A whole-genome association mapping strategy was applied to a Chinese population, yielding a P value of <10(-11). Individuals with the risk-associated genotype were estimated to have a likelihood of developing wet AMD 10 times that of individuals with the wild-type genotype."
17032782,17032782,Identification of a single nucleotide polymorphism of the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 gene and its association with growth and body composition traits in the chicken.,"Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 regulates a broad spectrum of biological activities involved in growth, development, and differentiation. The current study was designed to investigate the associations of IGFBP2 gene polymorphisms with chicken growth and body composition traits. The Northeast Agricultural University Resource Population (NEAURP) was established by crossing broiler sires, derived from lines at Northeast Agricultural University, that were divergently selected for abdominal fat, with Baier layer dams, a Chinese local breed. The F1 birds were inter-crossed to produce an F2 population. Body weight and body composition traits were measured in the NEAURP. The PCR primers for the intron 2 region of IGFBP2 were designed based on chicken genomic sequence. Nucleotide polymorphisms between parental lines were detected by DNA sequencing. A C/T SNP in intron 2 was detected, and PCR-RFLP methods were then developed to genotype the F2 individuals. The results showed that the IGFBP2 SNP was associated with multiple traits, including BW, metatarsus length, shank length, femur length, shank weight, femur weight, metatarsus claw weight, and abdominal fat weight in the 1,028 NEAURP F2 individuals. This research suggests that IGFBP2 or a tightly linked gene has broad effects on growth and development in the chicken."
17016049,17016049,The single nucleotide polymorphisms of I(Ks) potassium channel genes and their association with atrial fibrillation in a Chinese population.,"Recent studies suggest that genetic mutation of the slow delayed rectifier potassium channel (I(Ks)) may underlie atrial fibrillation (AF). We investigated the association between AF and the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes KCNQ1, KCNE1 and KCNE4 associated with this channel. Common non-synonymous SNPs in KCNQ1 and KCNE1 known to be frequent in Asian people were selected and direct sequencing of KCNE4 was performed to identify possible SNPs. The AF group consisted of 142 hospitalized patients with AF, the community control group consisted of 120 subjects, and a ward control group consisted of 118 hospitalized patients without AF. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was performed to determine the genotypes. The minor allele frequencies of P448R, R519H, G643S for KCNQ1 and G38S and D85N for KCNE1 in the AF group, the community control group and the ward control group were 9.9, 7.9, 9.3%; 0, 0, -; 4.3, 4.2, 1.7%; 28.4, 31.7, 29.7%; 0.7, 0.4%, -, respectively. There was no significant association between these SNPs and AF phenotype. There were eight SNPs in the whole length of KCNE4 plus 1,000 bases upstream of this gene including the non-synonymous SNP E145D. Logistical regression analysis revealed a difference in the distribution of KCNE4 E145D in the AF and the community control group (minor allele frequency was 34.0 versus 27.1% respectively, OR = 1.66, p = 0.044). We provided the frequencies of non-synonymous SNPs of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 in Chinese population; none of these SNPs was associated with AF. But KCNE4 E145D may be associated with the AF phenotype."

The -79C, -26C and +246A alleles of the PSORS1C3 gene, the CDSN*971T allele, CDSN*TTC (619T-1236T-1243C) and CDSN*5 (619T-1240G-1243C) are strongly associated with psoriasis in the caucasian population. Until now, no haplotype study of the PSORS1C3 and CDSN genes has been documented in Chinese patients with psoriasis vulgaris."
16957813,16957813,Similarity of the allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms in drug-related gene loci between Thai and northern East Asian populations: implications for tagging SNP selection in Thais.,"The similarity of the marker allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium structure between two populations are major factors for the determination of the transferability and efficiency of haplotype tagging SNP derived from one population to use for an indirect association study in another population. To prove the similarity between northern East Asian populations in Hapmap and Thais, 861 SNP in 166 drug-related genes shared between Thais, Han Chinese and Japanese were analyzed for their correlation statistics. Allele frequency, Fst statistics and linkage disequilibrium statistics (r (2)) showed a high correlation between these populations. TagSNP sets derived by an aggressive tagging algorithm from these 861 SNP in Japanese and Chinese were used to test the coverage of East Asia-derived tagSNP in Thais. TagSNP derived from Japanese and Chinese are comparable in the percentage of coverage of the alleles captured with tagSNP at r (2)>or=0.8 (93% vs. 93%) in these drug-related gene loci. Additional tagSNP sets derived from the combination of Japanese- and Chinese-derived tagging SNP sets were used to test the coverage in Thais. The later set improved the percentage of coverage of alleles captured with tagSNP at r (2)>or=0.8-98% for these sites. High similarity between Thais and northern East Asian allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium statistics supported that tagSNPs derived from the northern East Asian population should be useful for an indirect association study in Thais. The combination of non-overlapping Japanese derived tagSNP and Chinese-derived tagSNP improved the percentage of genomic coverage in Thais, at least in these drug-related gene loci."
16955415,16955415,Long contiguous stretches of homozygosity in the human genome.,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common sequence variation in the human genome; they have been successfully used in mapping disease genes and more recently in studying population genetics and cancer genetics. In a population-based association study using high-density oligonucleotide arrays for whole-genome SNP genotyping, we discovered that in the genomes of unrelated Han Chinese, 34 out of 515 (6.6%) individuals contained long contiguous stretches of homozygosity (LCSHs), ranging in the size from 2.94 to 26.27 Mbp (10.22+/-5.95 Mbp). Four out of four (100%) Taiwan aborigines also demonstrated this genetic characteristic. The number of LCSH regions increased markedly in the offspring of consanguineous marriages. LCSH was also detected in Caucasian samples (11/42; 26.2%) and African American samples (2/42; 4.76%). A total of 26 LCSH regions were recurrently detected among Han Chinese, Taiwan aborigines, and Caucasians. DNA copy number determination by hybridization intensity analysis and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) excluded deletion as the cause of LCSH. Our results suggest that LCSHs are common in the human genome of the outbred population and this genetic characteristic could have a significant impact on population genetics and disease gene studies."
16950232,16950232,GABRB2 association with schizophrenia: commonalities and differences between ethnic groups and clinical subtypes.,Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in intron 8 of type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor beta2 subunit gene (GABRB2) were initially found to be associated with schizophrenia in Chinese. This finding was subjected to cross-validation in this study with Japanese (JP) and German Caucasian (GE) subjects.
16949394,16949394,Cognitive functioning and sex steroid hormone gene polymorphisms in women at midlife.,"Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype frequencies were examined to determine whether variation in 6 estrogen-related genes was associated with differences in cognitive functioning in women at midlife. DNA from a multiracial/multiethnic sample of 875 African American, Caucasian, Chinese, and Japanese women aged 45 to 56 years participating in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) was genotyped. Gene markers from the sex steroid hormone pathway were linked to measures of cognitive functioning including the Digit Span Backward Test (DSB), a measure of working memory; the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), a measure of perceptual speed; and the East Boston Memory Test (EBMT), a measure of episodic memory. Statistical models were fit using logistic regression and general linear models to estimate the strength of association of estrogen-related polymorphisms with DSB, SDMT, and EBMT scores. On the EBMT, African American women and Caucasian women with ESR1 rs9340799 GG genotypes had about 1.5 to 2.0 times greater odds of remembering story elements on the EBMT-immediate recall test. Caucasian women with ESR1 rs2234693 CC genotypes had 1.3 to 1.5 times greater odds of remembering story elements on the EBMT-delayed recall test. Chinese women with 17HSD rs615942 GG genotypes, 17HSD rs592389 TT genotypes, and 17HSD rs2830 GG genotypes had about 1.7 times greater odds of remembering story elements on the EBMT-immediate recall test. African American women with CYP 19 rs936306 CC genotypes had about 0.25 to 0.40 lower odds of remembering story elements on the EBMT-immediate recall test, whereas Chinese women with CYP 19 rs936306 CC genotypes had about 2.3 times greater odds of remembering story elements on both the EBMT-immediate and -delayed recall tests. On the DSB, African American women with CYP 19 rs749292 GG genotype had a higher mean score. On the SDMT, Japanese women with ESR1 rs728524 GG genotypes had a higher mean score. On the 3 tests of cognitive functioning, there was 1 significant finding for CYP1A1 and none for the CYP1B1 or ESR2 SNPs. We conclude that selected genes involved in estrogen synthesis and metabolism may be associated with performance differences on cognitive function tests. Also, the relevant estrogen-related polymorphisms may vary by race/ethnicity."

The sample consisted of 1,301 participants from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) with measures of BMD and genotyping; of these, 295 were African American, 693 were Caucasian, 151 were Chinese, and 162 were Japanese. We evaluated the potential association of LS-BMD or hip BMD with 4 SNPs from the ESR1 gene (ESR1 rs9340799, ESR1 rs2234693, ESR1 rs728524, and ESR1 rs3798577), and 3 SNPs from the ESR2 gene (ESR2 rs1255998, ESR2 rs1256030, and ESR2 rs1256065). Unadjusted mean LS-BMD values ranged from 1.141+/-0.14 g/cm(2) in African American women to 1.031+/-0.11 g/cm2 in Japanese women; unadjusted mean hip BMD values ranged from 1.053+/-0.14 g/cm2 in African American women to 0.862+/-0.10 g/cm2 in Chinese women. African American and Japanese women with the ESR1 rs2234693 (PvuII) CC genotype had higher LS-BMDs than did their peers with the TT genotype (P=0.009 and P=0.04, respectively). Japanese women with the ESR1 rs3798577 CC or TC genotypes had lower LS-BMD than did Japanese women with the TT genotype (P=0.02 and P=0.01, respectively). Caucasian women with the TC genotype for ESR2 rs1256030 had lower LS-BMDs than did those with the CC genotype (P=0.02). Chinese women who were heterozygous for ESR2 rs1256030 or ESR2 rs1256065 had significantly higher LS-BMDs and hip BMDs than did the referent groups for each of these SNPs (CC and AA, respectively). Associations between BMD and ESR1 and ESR2 genotypes varied by race/ethnicity and by bone site. Our results differ from those previously reported for 2 ESR1 genotypes (ESR1 rs2234693 [PvuII] and ESR1 rs9340799 [XbaI]). Moreover, 2 ESR1 and 3 ESR2 SNPs we studied have not previously been examined with respect to BMD. Among these, ESR2 rs1256030 and ESR2 rs1256065 appear to have an effect at both the lumbar spine and hip in Chinese women and may warrant further study."
17063263,17063263,"Genetic variation in IGF1, IGF-1R, IGFALS, and IGFBP3 in breast cancer survival among Chinese women: a report from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study.","Disruption of the balance of IGF (Insulin like growth factor) pathway constituents has been implicated in the etiology and progression of breast and other cancers. We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms in IGF system members may be associated with breast cancer survival and evaluated this hypothesis in a cohort of 1,455 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1996 and 1998 in Shanghai, China. Nineteen functional or potentially functional polymorphisms were evaluated in the IGF-1, IGF-1R, IGFALS, and IGFBP3 genes. Disease recurrence and vital status were obtained with a median follow-up time of 7.1 years. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Overall, no significant association was noted between any of the 19 polymorphisms and survival. However, subgroup analyses demonstrated apparent interactions between menopausal status and survival for several (Single nucleotide polymorphism) SNPs in the IGF-1R and IGFBP3 genes. Carriers of the A/G or G/G genotypes (rs951715) in the IGF-1R gene had an increased risk of death among post-menopausal women (HR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.1-2.7). Significant associations with breast cancer survival in pre-menopausal women were found for two IGFBP3 polymorphisms (rs2854744 and rs3110697), with an additional polymorphism (rs6413441) reaching borderline significance (P = 0.05). Hazard ratios for overall survival among pre-menopausal women were 1.5 (95% CI = 1.1-2.0) for the C/T-T/T genotypes (rs3110697), 1.4 (95% CI = 1.0-1.9) for the A/C-C/C genotypes (rs2854744), and 1.4 (95% CI = 1.0-1.9) for the N/A-A/A genotypes (rs6413441). Taken together, these data suggest that polymorphisms in the IGF-1R and IGFBP3 genes may be associated with altered survival among subgroups of breast cancer patients defined by menopausal status."
16949384,16949384,Endogenous estradiol and its association with estrogen receptor gene polymorphisms.,"We evaluated potential associations between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants of the estrogen receptor genes ESR1 and ESR2 and circulating estradiol (E2) concentrations in women of 4 races/ethnicities. The study population was drawn from participants in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN). A total of 1,538 African American, Caucasian, Chinese, and Japanese women from SWAN participated in the Sex Steroid Hormone Genetics Protocol by providing blood for sex steroid hormone analyses and consenting to lymphocyte transformation from which DNA was extracted and genotyped. We evaluated 4 ESR1 SNPs (ESR1 rs9340799, ESR1 rs2234693, ESR1 rs728524, and ESR1 rs3798577), and 3 ESR2 SNPs (ESR2 rs1255998, ESR2 rs1256030, and ESR2 rs1256065). Mean E2 level was 196.0 +/- 4.0 pmol/L in women who were premenopausal and perimenopausal (with blood drawn on days 2 through 5 of the menstrual cycle follicular phase); however, mean E2 levels in Chinese and Japanese women were lower (155.7 +/- 10.6 pmol/L and 170.0 +/- 10.3 pmol/L, respectively) than in African American (196.4 +/- 8.1 pmol/L, P <0.05) or Caucasian women (210.7 +/- 5.9 pmol/L, P <0.002). The ESR1 rs3798577 CC genotype was associated with lower circulating E2 concentrations in African American women (P <0.07) and explained about 1% of the variation in circulating E2 concentrations. In Japanese women, the GC genotype of ESR2 rs1255998 was associated with significantly lower circulating E2 concentrations that explained about 4% of the variation. Circulating E2 concentrations were not strongly or consistently associated with selected polymorphisms for the estrogen receptor genes. The 2 strongest associations explained <4% of the total variation in the circulating E2 concentrations."
16905256,16905256,New variants in the CACNA1H gene identified in childhood absence epilepsy.,"Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is a common form of idiopathic generalized epilepsy with polygenic inheritance. In our previous studies, relatively high frequent variants in the T-type calcium channel gene, CACNA1H, were identified in the Chinese Han population, most of which are located in exons 6-12. The goal of this study was to identify additional variants in this region of the CACNA1H gene. To this end, exons 6-12 were sequenced in 100 newly recruited CAE trios and 191 normal controls. Thirty-nine variants were identified in CAE trios or controls, 14 of which were found only in CAE patients, including two nonsynonymous variants that were newly found. Thirteen of the 39 variants were found in both CAE patients and controls, 11 were found only in parents of CAE trios, and one was found only in controls. Twenty-eight of these variants had not been previously reported. Both permutation test and transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) indicated that a SNP-52037C>T in intron11 was significant in association with CAE. In conclusion, these data further support the hypothesis that CACNA1H is an important susceptibility gene for CAE in the Chinese Han population."
16919420,16919420,"SNP identification, linkage disequilibrium, and haplotype analysis for a 200-kb genomic region in a Korean population.","Understanding patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) across genomes may facilitate association mapping studies to localize genetic variants influencing complex diseases, a recognition that led to the International Haplotype Mapping Project (HapMap). Divergent patterns of haplotype frequency and LD across global populations require that the HapMap database be supplemented with haplotype and LD data from additional populations. We conducted a pilot study of the LD and haplotype structure of a genomic region in a Korean population. A total of 165 SNPs were identified in a 200-kb region of 22q13.2 by direct sequencing. Unphased genotype data were generated for 76 SNPs in 90 unrelated Korean individuals. LD, haplotype diversity, and recombination rates were assessed in this region and compared with the HapMap database. The pattern of LD and haplotype frequencies of Korean samples showed a high degree of similarity with Japanese data. There was a strong correlation between high LD and low recombination frequency in this region. We found considerable similarities in local LD patterns between three Asian populations (Han Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) and the CEPH population. Haplotype frequencies were, however, significantly different between them. Our results should further the understanding of distinctive Korean genomic features and assist in designing appropriate association studies."
16949393,16949393,Sex steroid hormone gene polymorphisms and depressive symptoms in women at midlife.,"Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype frequencies were examined to determine whether variation in 6 estrogen-related genes was associated with differences in self-reported depressive symptoms in women. In this substudy of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), DNA from a multiracial/multiethnic sample of 1,538 African American, Caucasian, Chinese, and Japanese women aged 42 to 52 years participating in SWAN was genotyped. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale. After excluding data from women taking antidepressants (n=103), statistical models were fit using multivariate logistic regression to predict the association of estrogen-related polymorphisms with the dichotomized CES-D score. Among Caucasian women, those with the CYP1A1 rs2606345 CC and AC genotypes had approximately 2-fold greater odds of having depressive symptoms than did those with the AA genotype (95% confidence intervals [CIs], 1.33 to 4.66 and 1.25 to 3.14, respectively). African American women with the CC genotype of the same SNP had 10-fold greater odds of having more depressive symptoms than did women with the AA genotype (95% CI, 1.20 to 86.20). In Japanese women, the odds of depressive symptoms were nearly 5-fold higher among those with CYP 19 rs936306 TT genotype (95% CI, 1.10 to 22.17) than in women with the CC genotype and 9.6-fold higher (95% CI, 2.01 to 45.81) than in women with the CT genotype. The odds of depressive symptoms among Chinese women with the 17HSD rs615942 TT genotype were nearly 11-fold higher than in those with the GT genotype (95% CI, 1.94 to 60.84) and >7-fold higher than in those with the GG genotype (95% CI, 1.13 to 51.82). These data provide evidence that selected genes involved in estrogen synthesis and metabolism increase the odds of more depressive symptoms in women who are premenopausal or perimenopausal."
16949391,16949391,The association of genetic polymorphisms in sex hormone biosynthesis and action with insulin sensitivity and diabetes mellitus in women at midlife.,"We evaluated associations of insulin sensitivity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants from sex hormone biosynthesis and action in women of 4 races/ethnicities. DNA was extracted from transformed cell samples of 1,538 women in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN). African American, Caucasian, Chinese, and Japanese women in SWAN enrolled in the Sex Steroid Hormone Genetics Protocol from whom fasting glucose and insulin measures (for estimating insulin sensitivity), diabetes status, and metabolic syndrome classification were obtained. SNPs from the genes encoding aromatase (CYP 19), 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17HSD) type 1, and the estrogen receptors-alpha (ESR1) and -beta (ESR2) were measured. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 20% in Chinese women, 22% in Japanese women, 28% in Caucasian women, and 43% in African American women. The prevalence of diabetes was 3% in Chinese women, 4% in Japanese women, 7% in Caucasian women, and 19% in African American women. Significant associations of CYP 19 genotypes and insulin sensitivity were observed in African American, Caucasian, and Japanese women. Selected ESR1 and ESR2 genotypes were associated with insulin sensitivity and metabolic syndrome only in Japanese and Chinese women. The strongest associations related 17HSD genotypes to diabetes in Caucasian women, with odds ratios ranging from 4.4 to 7.5 and confidence intervals that excluded the null value. We observed strong associations between variations in sex hormone biosynthesis and function genes with insulin sensitivity, the metabolic syndrome, and diabetes that varied by race/ethnicity. The strong association of 17HSD and diabetes in Caucasian women has not been previously reported and should be further investigated."
16949386,16949386,Characterizing variation in sex steroid hormone pathway genes in women of 4 races/ethnicities: the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN).,"This report characterizes genotypes and haplotypes in 6 genes (27 single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) from the Sex Steroid Hormone Genetics Protocol developed though the DNA Repository of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) Genetics Study. The SWAN Genetics Study is a component of a longitudinal study describing health-related attributes of the menopausal transition in African American, Caucasian, Chinese, Hispanic, and Japanese women. At baseline, SWAN recruited menstruating women, aged 42 to 52 years, who were not using exogenous hormones. During the sixth and seventh years of the study, buccal cells in a mouthwash slurry and whole blood were collected for a DNA repository. Immortalized cell lines were created and genotyped in 1,538 specimens from 1,757 women who participated in the SWAN Genetics Study. DNA from those cells was genotyped for genes in the sex steroid hormone pathway. SNPs were evaluated for genotype and allele frequencies (and differences) according to race/ethnicity and haplotyped in anticipation of studying their associations with health-related measures. We demonstrated that allele frequencies differed significantly by race/ethnicity. There was substantial linkage disequilibrium among many of the SNPs and only a few SNPs showed significant Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium within race/ethnicity. Finally, there are a number of haplotype patterns that vary according to race/ethnicity, including a ""yin-yang"" pattern for 17HSD among Caucasian, Chinese, and Japanese women, but not among African American women. Repository specimens developed in anticipation of genomic or metabolomics studies can extend the contribution of the parent study by developing hybrid strategies that support both SNP association studies as well as coarse and fine mapping to evaluate possible genomic locations of causal variants."

16829689,16829689,The effect of the cyclin D1 (CCND1) A870G polymorphism on colorectal cancer risk is modified by glutathione-S-transferase polymorphisms and isothiocyanate intake in the Singapore Chinese Health Study.,"Cyclin D1 (CCND1) regulates cellular decision between proliferation and growth arrest. Despite the functional relevance of the CCND1 A870G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) published results on its association with colorectal cancer (CRC) were inconsistent. We examined the association between this CCND1 genotype and CRC in the Singapore Chinese Health Study, a prospective investigation of diet and cancer in 63,000 Chinese men and women. We explored the hypothesis that inconsistency regarding the CCND1/CRC association may be attributable to the modifying effect of additional CRC risk factors. Since GSTM1/GSTT1 genotype and dietary isothiocyanate (ITC) intake had previously been identified as CRC risk factors in this cohort, we now explored if they influenced the CCND1/CRC association. In a nested case-control study within the Singapore Cohort, genomic DNA collected from 300 incident CRC cases and 1169 controls was examined for CCND1, GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 polymorphisms. Unconditional logistic regression was used to assess genotype effects on cancer risk. No main effect of CCND1 was observed, yet the CCND1 effect was influenced by ITC intake and GST genotypes. The presence of at least one CCND1 A-allele was associated with increased risk among low dietary ITC consumers (intake below median value for the cohort) with a high-activity GST profile (>or=2 of the 3 GST genotypes classified non-null or high-activity) [odds ratio (OR)=2.05; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10-3.82]. In contrast, the presence of at least one A-allele was associated with a decreased risk among all remaining subjects (OR=0.56; 0.36-0.86) (P for interaction=0.01). Recent studies indicate that ITCs inhibit cell proliferation and cause apoptosis through pro-oxidant properties. The results of our current study on CRC and those of our previous breast cancer study are compatible with the notion of oxidative stress in target cells as important determinant of direction and magnitude of the CCND1 effect."
16867246,16867246,Association of DRD2 polymorphisms and chlorpromazine-induced extrapyramidal syndrome in Chinese schizophrenic patients.,"Extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) is most commonly affected by typical antipsychotic drugs that have a high affinity with the D2 receptor. Recently, many research groups have reported on the positive relationship between the genetic variations in the DRD2 gene and the therapeutic response in schizophrenia patients as a result of the role of variations in the receptor in modulating receptor expression. In this study, we evaluate the role DRD2 plays in chlorpromazine-induced EPS in schizophrenic patients."
16823764,16823764,The contribution of genes involved in potassium-recycling in the inner ear to noise-induced hearing loss.,"Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is one of the most important occupational diseases and, after presbyacusis, the most frequent cause of hearing loss. NIHL is a complex disease caused by an interaction between environmental and genetic factors. The various environmental factors involved in NIHL have been relatively extensively studied. On the other hand, little research has been performed on the genetic factors responsible for NIHL. To test whether the variation in genes involved in coupling of cells and potassium recycling in the inner ear might partly explain the variability in susceptibility to noise, we performed a case-control association study using 35 SNPs selected in 10 candidate genes on a total of 218 samples selected from a population of 1,261 Swedish male noise-exposed workers. We have obtained significant differences between susceptible and resistant individuals for the allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies for three SNPs of the KCNE1 gene, and for the allele frequencies for one SNP of KCNQ1 and one SNP of KCNQ4. Patch-clamp experiments in high K+-concentrations using a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell model were performed to investigate the possibility that the KCNE1-p.85N variant (NT_011512.10:g.21483550G>A; NP_00210.2:p.Asp85Asn) was causative for high noise susceptibility. The normalized current density generated by KCNQ1/KCNE1-p.85N channels, thus containing the susceptibility variant, differed significantly from that from wild-type channels. Furthermore, the midpoint potential of KCNQ1/KCNE1-p.85N channels (i.e., the voltage at which 50% of the channels are open) differed from that of wild-type channels. Further genetic and physiological studies will be necessary to confirm these findings."
16946996,16946996,Role of B cell inhibitory receptor polymorphisms in systemic lupus erythematosus: a negative times a negative makes a positive.,"B lymphocytes play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Here, we will review our studies on the role of polymorphisms of two genes coding for B cell inhibitory receptors, FCGR2B and CD72. In FCGR2B, a single nucleotide polymorphism leading to a nonsynonymous substitution, Ile232Thr, within the transmembrane domain was identified, and a significant association of the 232Thr/Thr genotype with SLE was observed in Japanese, Thai and Chinese populations, while this allele was found to be rare in Caucasians. On the other hand, the association of FCGR2B promoter polymorphism with SLE in Caucasians has been reported by two independent groups, but this allele was not found to be present in Japanese. These observations demonstrate that the association of FCGR2B polymorphisms with SLE is common to multiple populations, but the alleles associated with SLE depend upon the genetic background of each population. Functional analyses using a human B cell line lacking endogenous FcgammaRIIb revealed that SLE-associated 232Thr allele product was partially excluded from membrane lipid rafts under resting conditions and after coligation with B cell receptor, and was significantly less potent at inhibiting B cell activation. Two haplotypes were identified in CD72, one of which was associated with increased production of an alternative splicing isoform that substantially alters the extracellular region of CD72. Interestingly, the presence of the haplotype significantly decreased the risk of SLE conferred by FCGR2B-232Thr in an epistatic manner. These observations emphasize the need to understand human immune system diversity if we are to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases."

Recent studies have evaluated the role of TNF promoter polymorphisms in IBD, whereas the data are inconsistent.

We investigate the association between TNF promoter polymorphisms and susceptibility to ulcerative colitis (UC) in the Chinese Han ethnic population."
16776465,16776465,Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms of the insulin gene with chicken early growth and fat deposition.,"Growth rate, body composition, and fat deposition are important traits in chickens. Insulin plays important roles in hepatic cells, muscle cells, and adipose tissue cells. The purpose of the present study was to analyze association of the insulin (INS) gene with chicken growth and body composition traits. Using a F2 design resource population constructed with the crossing of Chinese native Xinghua chickens and White Recessive Rock chickens, the association of 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP; A+428G, C+1549T, T+3737C, and A+3971G) of INS gene with 13 growth and body composition traits was studied. The T+3737C genotypes were significantly associated with small intestine length (P = 0.0002), and the A+3971G genotypes were significantly associated with early growth (hatch weight and BW at 28 d of age) (P < 0.0001), breast angle (P = 0.0002), and small intestine length (P < 0.0001). None of the 4 SNP was significantly associated with abdominal fat pad weight (P > 0.05). The haplotypes based on the 4 SNP were also significantly associated with early growth (hatch weight and BW at 28 d of age; P < 0.0001) and breast angle (P < 0.0001) but not with small intestine length (P = 0.0505). These results suggested that variation of the insulin gene was significantly associated with chicken early growth but not with fat deposition. In addition, the data from the present study supported the inference that both the one-SNP-at-a-time and the haplotype-based approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages when association analysis of one SNP and haplotypes with chicken complex traits was conducted."
16774538,16774538,MMP-1 promoter gene polymorphism and susceptibility to chronic periodontitis in a Chinese population.,"A single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of -1607 bp of the human MMP-1 gene has been found to be associated with an increased risk of various inflammatory diseases and cancer metastasis. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the MMP-1 promoter gene polymorphism and chronic periodontitis susceptibility and/or severity in a Chinese population. Genomic DNA was obtained from whole blood samples in 60 Chinese subjects with chronic periodontitis and 50 periodontally healthy subjects as controls. MMP-1 promoter fragment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and the polymorphism was analyzed by restriction endonuclease cleavage. In the control subjects, the 2G allele was observed a frequency of 49%, while in severely diseased patients, the 2G allele was seen in 73.4%. The individuals with the 2G allele seem to be approximately three times at greater risk for developing the severe chronic periodontitis (chi(2) = 12.148, P = 0.000). The genotype of 2G/2G was found in 58.5% of the severe periodontitis and 24% of the control group (chi(2) = 11.779, P = 0.003). This study suggests that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the MMP-1 promoter region of -1607 bp may be associated with severe chronic periodontitis in a Chinese population."
16894623,16894623,A review and re-evaluation of an association between the NOTCH4 locus and schizophrenia.,"This work reviewed all the reports on the NOTCH4 gene in schizophrenia, which have been published since the gene was found to be associated with illness among a British population in 2000. The results from independent studies were inconsistent. Allelic heterogeneity, clinical diagnosis, ethnical backgrounds, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) structures in the human genome may be major reasons for poor replication. A couple of studies suggested that the NOTCH4 gene could play a role in a subgroup of the disease, such as early-onset schizophrenia and negative symptoms. A single study revealed a weak association of the NOTCH4 gene with frontal lobe brain volumes and a strong association with frontal lobe cognitive performance. A meta-analysis showed stronger evidence of the NOTCH4 association in family-based studies than in case-control studies. In a previous study, we found that rs520692, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the NOTCH4 locus, was associated with schizophrenia in a Chinese population. In the present study, we applied a large sample size to re-evaluate our initial findings and then confirmed the rs520692 association with illness. The pairwise measures did not show strong LD between paired SNPs although the SNPs tested are located within a 34-kb region, suggesting that LD within the NOTCH4 gene has been broken rapidly by historical recombination in the Chinese population. Taken together, the NOTCH4 gene may be associated with schizophrenia but how the gene contributes to the etiology of the illness needs a further investigation."

16777502,16777502,T-1213C polymorphism of estrogen receptor beta is associated with low bone mineral density and osteoporotic fractures.,"Osteoporosis is a complex disease with a strong genetic component, but the genes involved are poorly defined. To determine whether estrogen receptor beta (ESR2) gene is an osteoporosis risk gene, we examined its association with bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk. Using a gene-based approach, a set of 12 polymorphisms of ESR2 was studied in 752 case-control pairs of southern Chinese in ethnicity. Among all polymorphisms, the most significant relation with BMD and fracture risk was observed with T-1213C. Subjects with low BMD had a higher frequency of the variant C allele of T-1213C (cases 11.4%, control 8.4%, P = 0.02). The C allele was associated with 4% reduction in BMD at both the spine and hip in women, and 11% reduction in spine BMD and 9% reduction in hip BMD in men. Similar results were seen with SNP haplotype analysis. Subjects with the C allele of T-1213C were associated with higher risks of osteoporosis and BMD T scores < or = -2.5 (odds ratios: 2.2 at spine and 3.5 at femoral neck for women; 3.5 at lumbar spine for men). Postmenopausal women carrying this C allele were associated with 2.22-fold increased risk of osteoporotic fractures (95% confidence interval 1.26-4.25) even after adjusting for BMD. In conclusion, ESR2 is involved in BMD determination in both sexes. The T-1213C polymorphism influences the risk of fracture in postmenopausal women independent of BMD."
16707163,16707163,Investigation of genetic association between human Frizzled homolog 3 gene (FZD3) and schizophrenia: results in a Korean population and evidence from meta-analysis.,"The neurodevelopmental hypothesis offers a promising approach through which to explore the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Human Frizzled-3 protein is one of the major components of the Wnt signaling pathway and plays a crucial role in regulating early neurodevelopmental processes. Therefore, the human Frizzled homolog 3 (FZD3) gene, which encodes this protein, may be an excellent candidate gene for association studies of schizophrenia. To replicate the previously reported positive association between FZD3 and schizophrenia in Han Chinese and Japanese populations, we genotyped two single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers of FZD3 in 241 unrelated schizophrenic patients and 192 control subjects. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the genotypic and allelic frequencies in the two groups. In addition, to integrate and evaluate the accumulated evidence published to date, we performed a meta-analysis on the published data, including our own. No evidence was found to support the association between either of the investigated SNP markers and schizophrenia in a Korean population. Moreover, the meta-analytic result did not support the association between several commonly investigated markers in FZD3 and schizophrenia. Failure to replicate previous positive association results could reflect various theoretical factors. Therefore, other sources of error have to be ruled out before coming to a conclusion. In the case of FZD3, it seems that repeated failures to replicate the original results by several independent research groups combine to provide evidence against an association between FZD3 and schizophrenia. Other candidate genes involved in early neurodevelopmental processes may deserve further investigation."
16703675,16703675,The Fas gene A-670G polymorphism is not associated with sporadic Alzheimer disease in a Chinese Han population.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by excessive neuronal loss, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular deposition of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). The Fas antigen is a cell surface receptor-mediating cell apoptosis. Several lines of evidence have made Fas/Fas ligand induced apoptosis play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. Moreover, the Fas gene is located on chromosome 10q24.1, a region of linkage to late-onset AD. Several reports have investigated the association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that is located at position -670 of Fas gene and AD, but yielded ambiguous results. To figure out the association of this SNP with sporadic AD in Chinese Han population, we have analyzed 509 patients with AD and 561 controls for the genetic association studies. Our results indicate that the distribution of the Fas genotypes (chi(2) = 0.66, P = 0.72) and alleles (chi(2) = 0.70, P = 0.40) did not differ significantly. The similar results were observed when AD and control groups were stratified by age/age at onset and sex (P > 0.10). The present data revealed no significant effect of the genotypes on the age of onset for developing AD, and no significant association between the genotypes and the severity of the disease."

16524593,16524593,Case-control association study of Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) gene and schizophrenia in the Chinese population.,"Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) has first been identified as a candidate gene for schizophrenia through study of a Scottish family with a balanced (1; 11) (q42.1; q14.3) translocation. Lots of linkage and association studies supported DISC1 as a risk factor for schizophrenia. In this study, we genotyped three SNPs in DISC1 using a set of Han Chinese samples of 560 schizophrenics and 576 controls. No positive association was detected in the whole samples but analysis of allele frequencies in female samples showed weak association between SNP rs2295959 and the disease (chi(2)=6.188, P=0.0135, OR=0.728, 95% CI=0.567-0.935). Our results provide further evidence for sex difference for the effect of the gene on the aetiology of schizophrenia. Our findings also would encourage further studies, particularly family-based association studies with larger samples, to analyze the association between DISC1 and schizophrenia."

16511504,16511504,Association of hypertension with single nucleotide polymorphisms in the quantitative trait locus for abdominal obesity-metabolic syndrome on chromosome 17.,"Genome scan in Chinese revealed an association of blood pressure with the microsatellite marker D17S1303, which lies in a quantitative trait locus for the abdominal obesity-metabolic syndrome (AOMS2) at 17p12 on chromosome 17. We previously reported that D17S1303 was associated with hypertension and obesity. Therefore, we studied 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) within 3 kb of D17S1303. One hundred and eighty hypertensive subjects (91 men, 89 women, age 53+/-12 years) and 180 normotensive matched controls (91 men, 89 women, age 52+/-11) were genotyped using the Sequenom genotyping platform. Allelic frequencies in these Chinese subjects differed from those reported for Caucasians. Three SNPs (rs11656507, rs1357926, rs852319) were homozygous in our subjects. The genotype frequencies of rs852320, rs852321 and rs852322 did not differ between hypertensive and normotensive subjects. However, there were significant differences for rs1525402 (P=0.048), rs2692343 (P=0.022), rs2692344 (P=0.017) and rs2321313 (P=0.028). A four-locus haplotype comprising G at rs1525402, C at rs2692343, C at rs2692344 and G at rs2321313 was associated with lower systolic blood pressure (P=0.023) and normotension (P=0.048). Our results provide further evidence that there is a gene, as yet unidentified, influencing blood pressure in the vicinity of D17S1303 in a quantitative trait locus for abdominal obesity-metabolic syndrome at 17p12."
16505001,16505001,Positive association between POU1F1 and mental retardation in young females in the Chinese Han population.,"Genetic defects attributable to the genes involved in the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) gland axis can cause abnormal thyroid hormone function and mental retardation (MR). Pit-1, encoded by the POU1F1 gene on human chromosome 3p11, is a pituitary-specific transcription factor responsible for the expression of several pituitary hormones. Thyrotropin is one of these hormones and is an important regulator in the HPT axis. One of the symptoms of patients with POU1F1 mutations is hypothyroidism and abnormalities of the nervous system early in the period after birth. We performed a case-control association study and a quantitative analysis of IQ to investigate the possible genetic contribution of POU1F1 in the Chinese Han population. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis showed that rs300996, snp-7057 and rs300977 were in strong LD. There were significant differences of allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies of these three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between cases and controls. When we conducted a breakdown comparison between cases and controls within different gender groups, no positive results in males were found. In females, however, we found significant differences between cases and controls in allele frequency distribution of rs300996 (P=0.0003), snp-7057 (P=0.0001) and rs300977 (P=0.0005) and in the distributions of common haplotypes combined by these SNPs (global P=0.0050). The P-value was 0.0301 for rs300996 and 0.0397 for the haplotype combination of rs300996-snp-7057-rs300977 in the analysis of the quantitative effects of the alleles and haplotypes on IQ in females. Our data suggest that POU1F1 may affect MR through a gender-specific mechanism."
16510536,16510536,A novel SNP at exon 17 of INSR is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity in Chinese women with PCOS.,"To investigate the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exon 17 of the insulin receptor (INSR) gene with insulin resistance and INSR beta-subunit expression in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients, a case-control study was carried out in an academic endocrinology clinic of China. One hundred and nine Chinese patients with PCOS and 107 healthy Chinese women as control were recruited. Their leukocytes and red blood cells were separated from blood samples, for SNP analysis with single-stranded conformation polymorphism and for the INSR beta-subunit expression detection by western blot analysis, respectively. A novel T/C SNP at codon Cys1008 (position 3128 of NM_000208) of INSR was found in two allele genotypes, i.e. the homozygous CC and the heterozygous TC. A higher frequency of the mutant homozygous CC was observed in the PCOS women with PCOS than that in the controls (21.1 versus 5.6%, P < 0.01). In contrast with the women with wild-type genotype, a significantly lower insulin sensitivity index in the women with each of the two mutant genotypes was revealed (CC: 0.335 +/- 0.026/TC: 0.346 +/- 0.027 versus TT: 0.367 +/- 0.029, P < 0.05). No relationship was found between the novel SNP and the INSR beta-subunit expression. We concluded that the novel T/C SNP at codon Cys1008 of INSR is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity in Chinese women with PCOS and that the association is not by the change of synthesis or secretion of INSR beta-subunit, but most possibly by the effects of this novel SNP on the function of INSR beta-subunit."

SNPs of NOS3 A-922G, T-786C and G894T were genotyped by allele-specific primer (ASP) PCR. The distribution of genotype combinations of three SNPs was determined by clustering analysis. There were no difference in allele genotype distribution frequency and haplotype frequency of NOS3 G894T, NOS3 A-922G and NOS3 T-786C between the essential hypertension group and the healthy population (P>0.05). According to sex stratification, no association between essential hypertension and SNP of NOS3 A-922G,NOS3 T-786C or NOS3 G894T has been found in either the male subgroup or the female subgroup. In respect of allele genotype combination frequency in the natural distribution of NOS3 A-922 G, NOS3 T-786C and NOS3 G894T SNP, there was significant difference only in the allele genotype combination frequency of NOS3 G894G+A-922G+T-786T between the hypertension group and the healthy group (P<0.05, Chi2=4.5944). According to sex stratification, there were no significant difference in all above allele genotype combination frequency in three sites of NOS3 SNP between the hypertension male subgroup and the healthy male subgroup (P>0.05). There was significant difference in the allele combination frequency of NOS3 G894G +A-922G+T-786C between the hypertension female subgroup and the healthy female subgroup(P<001, Chi2=8.502). There was no association of SNP in NOS3 A-922G, NOS3 T-786C or NOS3 G894T with hypertension in the Chinese Han nationality population, nor was there a sex difference. The combination frequency of allele NOS3 G894G + A-922G + T-786C in the hypertension female subgroup was much lower than that in the healthy female subgroup, suggesting that female population with this combination genotype may be less susceptible to hypertension."

The study was conducted in 353 patients with metabolic syndrome. The alleles of the ACE2 A/G polymorphism, which is located on the X chromosome, were detected using polymerase chain reaction and subsequent cleavage by Alu I restriction endonuclease. G allele frequencies in patients with metabolic syndrome were 36.6% in female subjects and 43.4% in male subjects, respectively. Female patients with metabolic syndrome who carry the GG genotype had a significantly higher diastolic blood pressure compared with other genotypes. Multivariate logistic regression showed that female gender (P = 0.019) and carrying only the G allele (odds ratio 2.83 [95% CI 1.36 to 5.91]; P = 0.005) were significantly associated with increased diastolic blood pressure. It is concluded that the ACE2 A/G polymorphism is associated with hypertension in patients with metabolic syndrome."

16270629,16270629,VKORC1 haplotypes and their impact on the inter-individual and inter-ethnical variability of oral anticoagulation.,"In order to elucidate the role of VCORC1 sequence variants in warfarin sensitivity, we established a complete SNP map of the VKORC1 gene locus in 200 blood donors from Western Germany. Nearly all of the genetic variability of the VKORC1 gene in Europeans is reflected by three main haplotypes. Recently described polymorphisms associated with low warfarin dose requirement (dbSNP:rs9934438; dbSNP:rs17878363) were found in complete linkage disequilibrium with the VKORC1*2 haplotype. In two patient cohorts of European origin with either increased coumarin sensitivity (n= 14) or partial coumarin resistance (n=36) the VKORC1*2 frequency varied highly significant between the two groups and also when compared to 200 blood donor controls (coumarin sensitive 96%, coumarin resistant 7%, controls 42%) thus demonstrating a strong association between these two phenotypes and the VKORC1 haplotype (p = 1.6 x 10(-8) for coumarin sensitive and p = 1.9 x 10(-8) for coumarin resistant). Analysis of database derived VKORC1 genotypes of African Americans and Chinese revealed that haplotype frequencies in these populations differ significantly from the European sample (for VKORC1*2: Europeans 42%, Chinese 95%, African Americans 14%). These observations suggest VKORC1 as principal genetic modulator of the ethnic differences in warfarin response. Since hereditary pharmacodynamic (VKORC1) and pharmacokinetic (CYP2C9) factors account for up to 50% of the inter-individual variability of the warfarin response, these genetic markers may serve as clinically relevant predictors of warfarin dosing in future studies."

16376517,16376517,"Comparative study of the linkage disequilibrium of an ENCODE region, chromosome 7p15, in Korean, Japanese, and Han Chinese samples.","The extent and pattern of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the human genome provide important information for disease gene mapping. Previous studies have shown that LDs vary depending on chromosomal regions and populations. As the Asian samples of the International HapMap Project consisted of Japanese and Chinese populations, it was of interest whether we could use the HapMap data as a reference to carry out association studies of common complex diseases in a closely related population, such as Koreans. We have compared the LD and recombination patterns defined by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ENCODE region ENm010, chromosome 7p15.2, in Korean, Japanese, and Chinese samples and further tested the robustness of tagSNPs among the Asian samples. We genotyped 792 SNPs in 500 kb (chromosome 7: 26699793-27199792, NCBI build 34) from 90 unrelated Koreans by fluorescence polarization detection and compared the data with Asian data from the HapMap project. Despite some differences in the position of high LD region boundaries, the overall patterns of LD were remarkably similar across the three samples, reflecting strong genetic affinities among them. Furthermore, the haplotype tag SNP transferability across the three samples was greater than 90%. Our results support the initial suggestion that the populations genotyped in the HapMap project might serve as reference populations for the selection of tagSNPs in association studies."

16176390,16176390,Association analysis of the RGS4 gene in Han Chinese and Scottish populations with schizophrenia.,"We investigated the RGS4 as a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia in Chinese Han (184 trios and 138 sibling pairs, a total of 322 families) and Scottish (580 cases and 620 controls) populations using both a family trio and case-control design. Both the samples had statistical power greater than 70% to detect a heterozygote genotype relative risk of >1.2 for frequent RGS4-risk alleles. We genotyped four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which have previously been associated with schizophrenia as either individually or part of haplotypes. Allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium between the SNPs was similar in the two populations. In the Chinese sample, no individual SNPs or any of their haplotypes were associated with schizophrenia. In the Scottish population, one SNP (SNP7) was significantly over-represented in the cases compared with the controls (0.44 vs. 0.38; A allele; chi(2) 7.08, P = 0.011 after correction for correlation between markers by permutation testing). One two-marker haplotype, composed of alleles T and A of SNP4 and SNP7, respectively, showed individual significance after correction by permutation testing (chi(2) 6.8; P = 0.04). None of the full four-marker haplotypes showed association, including the G-G-G-G haplotype previously associated with schizophrenia in more than one sample and the A-T-A-A haplotype. Thus, our data do not directly replicate previous associations of RGS4, but association with SNP 7 in the Scottish population provides some support for a role in schizophrenia susceptibility. We cannot conclusively exclude RGS4, as associated haplotypes are likely to be surrogates for unknown causative alleles, whose relationship with overlying haplotypes may differ between the population groups. Differences in the association seen across the two populations could result from methodological factors such as diagnostic differences but most likely result from ethnic differences in haplotype structures within RGS4."
16115752,16115752,A genetic study of two calcium-independent cytosolic PLA2 genes in schizophrenia.,"The present study detected 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the PLA2G4C and PLA2G6 loci among 240 Chinese parent-offspring trios of Han descent. Of these 9 SNPs, 5 showed highly polymorphic in the Chinese population. They were then applied as genetic markers to test the genetic association of these two calcium-independent cytosolic PLA2 genes with schizophrenia. The transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) showed that rs1549637 at the PLA2G4C locus was the only SNP associated with the illness (chi(2) = 5.63, P = 0.018). The global P-value was 0.082 for 1000 permutations with the TDT analysis. Neither the conditional on allele test nor the conditional on genotype test showed a disease association for the combination of these two genes. Because the PLA2G4C association is so weak, this initial finding should be interpreted with caution."
16256416,16256416,A single nucleotide polymorphism in the matrix metalloproteinase-1 promoter enhances oral squamous cell carcinoma susceptibility in a Chinese population.,"We genotyped 96 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients for the 1G/2G polymorphism of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) promoter -1607 bp using PCR-RFLP. A control population of 120 frequency-matched subjects was also genotyped for the same polymorphism. The detection frequency of 2G allele was significantly higher in OSCC subjects (76%) than in the control group (56.7%). The frequency of 2G allele had a significant difference between the OSCC and controls group (p = 0.00, Odds Ratio, OR = 2.232, 95% CI = 1.477-3.372). The genotype 2G/2G was found in 57.3% of the OSCC, and 34.2% in the controls. The proportion of 2G homozygote (2G/2G) was significantly higher in the OSCC group when compared to controls (p = 0.001, OR = 2.585, 95% CI = 1.487-4.494). OSCC patients were stratified by clinicopathological parameters including gender, smoking, clinical stage and lymph node metastasis, but the only statistically significant association with MMP-1 genotype was with smoking. The results showed that a SNP in the MMP-1 promoter -1607 bp was associated with OSCC susceptibility in a Chinese population."

16044171,16044171,Identifying potential risk haplotypes for schizophrenia at the DTNBP1 locus in Han Chinese and Scottish populations.,"The dystrobrevin-binding protein 1 (DTNBP1) gene on chromosome 6p has emerged as a potential susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. Although a number of attempts to replicate the original association finding have been successful, they have not identified any obvious pathogenic variants or a single at risk haplotype common to all populations studied. In the present study we attempted further replication in an independent sample of 638 nuclear families from the Han Chinese population of Sichuan Province, SW China. We also examined 580 Scottish schizophrenic cases and 620 controls. We genotyped 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DTNBP1 that were used in the original report of association, plus rs2619538 (SNP 'A') in the putative promoter region, which has also been associated with schizophrenia. In the Chinese trios we found that two SNPs (P1635 and P1765) were significantly overtransmitted, but with alleles opposite to those reported in the original studies. SNPs P1757 and P1765 formed a common haplotype, which also showed significant overtransmission. In the Scottish cases and controls, no individual markers were significantly associated with schizophrenia. A single haplotype, which included rs2619538 and P1583, and one rare haplotype, composed of P1320 and P1757, were significantly associated with schizophrenia, but no previously reported haplotypes were associated. Based on the data from the Chinese population, our results provide statistical support for DTNBP1 as a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia, albeit with haplotypes different from those of the original study. However, our lack of replication in the Scottish samples also indicates that caution is warranted when evaluating the robustness of the evidence for DTNBP1 as genetic risk factor for schizophrenia."

Acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1), an endoplasmic-reticulum-resident enzyme that catalyses the formation of cholesteryl esters (CEs) from cholesterol and long-chain fatty acids, modulates the generation of beta amyloid peptide (Abeta). A single nucleotide polymorphism rs1044925 in the sterol O-acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1), the gene encoding ACAT1, has been reported to be association with an increased risk for sporadic AD (SAD) in European population. In the present study, we examined the association of the SOAT1 rs1044925 polymorphism with SAD in our northern Han-Chinese (107 cases, 118 age and gender-matched controls) sample using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. There was no genotypic (chi(2)=0.030, OR 0.942, 95% CI=0.478-1.857) or allelic (chi(2)=0.021, OR 0.955, 95% CI=0.508-1.794) association between SAD and controls, even when the data were stratified by APOEvarepsilon4 carrier status.

15896461,15896461,Rapid detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms related with lung cancer susceptibility of Chinese population.,"Genetic variations have been thought to contribute to individual differences in lung cancer susceptibility. In our study, the possibility of an association of CYP1B1, GSTP1 and hOGG1 genetic polymorphisms with lung cancer was investigated in Chinese population of Nanjing, by a new single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing approach of di-allele-specific-amplification with artificially modified primers (diASA-AMP) technique. A matched case-control study of 227 patients with lung cancer was conducted to detect CYP1B1 Leu432Val, GSTP1 Ile105Val and hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphisms. Genotypes were analyzed by diASA-AMP technique. Results did not show a significant difference in distributions of allele frequencies or genotypes of CYP1B1, GSTP1 and hOGG1 between two groups. However, stratifying on smoking status demonstrated that CYP1B1 432Val genotype had a slightly combined effect on lung cancer with smoker subjects (OR=2.78, 95%CI=1.46-5.29). The interaction between GSTP1 105Val mutation and smoking in the development of lung cancer were not detected, nor was hOGG1 326Cys mutation. Variant allele frequencies of CYP1B1, GSTP1 and hOGG1 in control group were similar to other reports of Chinese population. The sequencing results of CYP1B1, GSTP1 and hOGG1 matched the ones of diASA-AMP technique. CYP1B1 432Val polymorphism may modulate the individual susceptibility of lung cancer among smokers in Chinese population. GSTP1 Ile105Val and hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphisms were not found to be risk factors of lung cancer in this study. The method diASA-AMP is rapid, specific and cost-effective. It can be used for rapid detection of the genes related with tumor susceptibility of population."
15878285,15878285,Association of interleukin-1B (IL-1B) gene polymorphisms with risk of gastric cancer in Chinese population.,"The incidence of gastric cancer (GC) in China is among the highest in the world. In present work, 154 patients with GC and 166 healthy controls in population of north-western China were investigated to evaluate the genetic associations of IL-1B gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms of IL-1RN gene with increased risk of GC. The frequency of IL-1B+3954C/T was significantly higher in GC cases group (25.97%) than that in controls (4.82%) with odds ratio (OR)=6.93 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.13-15.36); the frequencies of IL-1B-31C/T, IL-1B-31C/C and IL-1B-511C/T genotypes were also higher in GC cases group (51.95%, 23.38% and 50.65%) than those in controls (46.99%, 19.88% and 42.77%) with OR=1.48 (95% CI 0.88-2.49), OR=1.58 (95% CI 0.84-2.95) and OR=1.39 (95% CI 0.80-2.41), respectively. The results show that these SNPs of IL-1B gene are associated with significantly increased risk of GC. This is the first report that IL-1B+3954C/T heterozygote is associated with greatly increased risk of GC. The results of this study did not support the report that IL-1RN*2+ genotypes were associated with increased risk of GC in Chinese population."
15841096,15841096,An association study of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor NR1 subunit gene (GRIN1) and NR2B subunit gene (GRIN2B) in schizophrenia with universal DNA microarray.,"Dysfunction of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors has been implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia based on psychotomimetic properties of several antagonists and on observation of genetic animal models. To conduct association analysis of the NMDA receptors in the Chinese population, we examined 16 reported SNPs across the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit gene (GRIN1) and NR2B subunit gene (GRIN2B), five of which were identified in the Chinese population. In this study, we combined universal DNA microarray and ligase detection reaction (LDR) for the purposes of association analysis, an approach we considered to be highly specific as well as offering a potentially high throughput of SNP genotyping. The association study was performed using 253 Chinese patients with schizophrenia and 140 Chinese control subjects. No significant frequency differences were found in the analysis of the alleles but some were found in the haplotypes of the GRIN2B gene. The interactions between the GRIN1 and GRIN2B genes were evaluated using the multifactor-dimensionality reduction (MDR) method, which showed a significant genetic interaction between the G1001C in the GRIN1 gene and the T4197C and T5988C polymorphisms in the GRIN2B gene. These findings suggest that the combined effects of the polymorphisms in the GRIN1 and GRIN2B genes might be involved in the etiology of schizophrenia.European Journal of Human Genetics (2005) 13, 807-814. doi:10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201418 Published online 20 April 2005."

15882779,15882779,Lack of evidence for association between the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) polymorphisms and autism in the Chinese trios.,"Serotonin regulates several aspects of brain development, and it is involved in a range of behaviors frequently disturbed in autistic disorder. The serotonin transporter is a critical component of the serotonergic system. The serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) is of special interest given the nature of the biological findings and the reported effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors of autistic symptoms. So far the genetics researches of the SLC6A4 gene have given conflicting results. The aim of study was to investigate the association between the SLC6A4 gene and autism in the Chinese Han population. The present study was conducted with the detection of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP(S)) located within the SLC6A4 gene by using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) analysis. We performed a family-based association study of these polymorphisms in 175 Chinese Han family trios. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) measurement (D') analysis showed the presence of LD between markers across the locus. No significant evidence of association was found at any of the markers detected by using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) and haplotype analyses in all samples and male samples. Our findings suggest that it is unlikely that DNA variations in the SLC6A4 gene play a significant role in the genetic predisposition to autism in the Chinese Han population or that allelic heterogeneity at the SLC6A4 loci dilutes potential disease-allele association."
15770500,15770500,Intragenic linkage disequilibrium structure of the human perilipin gene (PLIN) and haplotype association with increased obesity risk in a multiethnic Asian population.,"Perilipin is a lipid droplet surface protein present in adipocytes and steroidogenic cells. We examined five common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the perilipin (PLIN) locus (PLIN 6209C>T, 10171A>T, 11482G>A, 13041A>G, and 14995A>T) to investigate their association with obesity risk. The study population included 4,131 subjects of three ethnic groups (Chinese, Malay, and Indian) from Singapore. The prevalence of obesity in Malays and Indians was much higher than in Chinese. Moreover, in these groups the prevalence of obesity was three times higher in women than in men. Crude analysis indicated that haplotype 11212 (CAAAT) is shared by Malays and Indians and is significantly associated with increased obesity risk as compared to the most common haplotype 21111 (TAGAA): OR 1.65 (95% CI 1.11-2.46) in Malays and 1.94 (95% CI 1.06-3.53) in Indians. No associations between PLIN haplotypes and obesity risk were found in Chinese. To simplify the haplotype analyses we used a subgroup of three SNPs (11482G>A, 13041A>G, and 14995A>T) in positive linkage disequilibrium. These analyses revealed similar associations, showing that haplotypes XX212 (XXAAT) and XX222 (XXAGT) are associated with increased obesity risk in Malays OR 2.04 (95% CI 1.28-3.25) and 2.05 (95% CI 1.35-3.12) respectively, and that haplotype XXX212 (XXAAT) is significantly associated with increased obesity risk in Indians OR 2.16 (95% CI 1.10-4.26) after adjusting for covariates including age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, and diabetes status. Moreover, individual SNP analyses demonstrated that the PLIN 14995A>T SNP is the most informative single genetic marker for the observed haplotype association, being significantly associated with increased obesity risk in both Malays OR 2.28 (95% CI 1.45-3.57) and Indians OR 2.04 (95% CI 1.08-3.64). These results support the role of the PLIN locus as an ethnically dependent modulator of obesity risk in humans."

Recently, some genetic variants within CAPON have been reported as exhibiting significant linkage disequilibrium to schizophrenia in Canadian familial-schizophrenia pedigrees. We examined nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which span an approximately 236-kb region of CAPON, in 664 schizophrenia cases and 941 controls in the Chinese Han population. We detected a significant difference in allele distributions of SNP rs348624 (P = 0.000017). Moreover, the overall frequency of haplotypes constructed from three SNPs including rs348624 showed significant difference between cases and controls (P = 0.000025). Our findings indicate that CAPON gene may be a candidate susceptibility gene for schizophrenia in Chinese Han population, and also provide further support for the potential importance of NMDAR-mediated glutamatergic transmission in the etiology of schizophrenia."

An association between a missense polymorphism in the close homologue of L1 (CHL1, CALL) gene and schizophrenia. In order to test this finding, we genotyped four SNPs in the gene in the Han Chinese population using a sample of 560 cases and 576 controls. Analysis of allele frequencies in both samples also showed strong association between SNP rs2272522 (the same marker studied by K. Sakurai) and the disease (X2=31.591, P<0.000001, OR=1.745, 95% CI=1.435-2.121).

By using PCR-RFLP and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), we estimated the pattern of intragenic linkage disequilibrium and the haplotype structure and explored the possible association between the polymorphisms of AGT gene and essential hypertension in a case-control study. Seven polymorphic sites (SNPs) and seven major haplotypes of AGT gene were analyzed. Among the individual SNP pairs examined, the A-6G, C+31T and M235T are nearly completely disequilibrium. All those single polymorphism loci were individually not associated with hypertension. But we found the frequency of haplotype H2 (-217: G, -152: G, -20: A, -6: G, +31: T, 174: T, 235: M) was significantly higher in controls than patients (P=0.010). Our study suggested that few haplotypes derived seven polymorphism loci could account for the most of the variation in AGT gene in Chinese Hans. The haplotype H2 of AGT gene might represent or be in disequilibrium with a genetic protective factor against EH."

Variability of CYP2J2 gene is highly constrained except for at its proximal promoter a relatively common and functionally relevant single nucleotide polymorphism, namely CYP2J2*7, with allele frequency being 17%, 5.49%, 13%, and 4.23% in African, White, Asian, and Korean, respectively. Since this genetic variation differs strikingly between ethnic groups, we characterized the CYP2J2*7polymorphism in Chinese."
15464270,15464270,Association of DAAO with schizophrenia in the Chinese population.,"Recently, the gene called DAAO was reported to be associated with schizophrenia in the French Canadian populations. Here, we report a result obtained in the study of our large collection of 547 schizophrenia cases and 536 controls in the Chinese population. Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped at and around the DAAO locus, covering a 10-kb region entirely encompassing the complementary DNA sequences of DAAO. We found statistically significant differences in allele distributions on one marker: SNP rs3741775 (P = 0.0000001). In the haplotype analysis based on the information of linkage-disequilibrium block across this gene locus, we demonstrated a highly significant association between schizophrenia and a DAAO haplotype (P = 2.0173 x 10(-21)), which therefore provides an independent statistical support for association of the DAAO gene with schizophrenia and indicates that the DAAO gene may play a significant role in the etiology of schizophrenia in the Han Chinese."
15489219,15489219,Case-control study and transmission disequilibrium test provide consistent evidence for association between schizophrenia and genetic variation in the 22q11 gene ZDHHC8.,"Genetic variants in the 22q11 gene ZDHHC8, which encodes a putative transmembrane palmitoyltransferase, has been associated to schizophrenia in family-based linkage disequilibrium (LD) studies. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs175174 (A/G), which had the strongest association, has been shown recently to regulate the level of the fully functional transcript by modulating the retention of intron 4 of ZDHHC8. In this work, we genotyped three genetic variants within the ZDHHC8 locus and conducted association studies in both population- and family-based samples of the Han Chinese population. The three polymorphisms spanning approximately 5.5 Kb were detected to be in significant LD. Our results provided compelling supportive evidence for association of the variants within the ZDHHC8 locus with schizophrenia but revealed different risk allele at SNP rs175174. The G allele was significantly more common in cases than in controls (69.47 : 59.96%; P=0.000018) and excess transmission of the same allele was confirmed in the family-based transmission disequilibrium test (transmitted/non-transmitted=87 : 54; P=0.0055). Both sample sets even shared the same risk haplotype with similar frequency. Our current data presents consistent association results obtained from both case-control and family-based samples in a same laboratory under the same experimental condition. Despite the potential genetic heterogeneity, our independent findings further support that the 22q11 region is likely to harbor candidate schizophrenia susceptibility genes."

15450681,15450681,Tumor suppressor gene TP53 is genetically associated with schizophrenia in the Chinese population.,"Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental disorder. The TP53 tumor suppressor gene, encoding a phosphoprotein, is a key element in maintaining genomic stability and cell apoptosis. Recently, reduced risk of cancer in patients of schizophrenia has been reported. Some evidence also suggests the possible implication of TP53 in neurodevelopment. In order to examine the role of the TP53 gene in the pathogenesis of schizophrenic disorders, we investigated the genetic association between a functional polymorphism rs1042522 and schizophrenia by sequencing the fragment covering 72Pro> Arg in 701 cases and 695 controls in this work. In addition, we studied two other SNPs rs2078486 and rs8064946 by allele-specific PCR in the same samples. Though rs1042522 and rs8064946 did not show positive association with schizophrenia, we did observe statistically significant differences on SNP rs2078486 (P-value = 0.029; OR = 1.21; 95% CI 1.02-1.42) and on haplotype CAC (P-value = 0.0068; OR = 1.36; 95% CI 1.09-1.70).

Family-based analysis of asthma and two common SNPs [G1544C and G1651A (rs545659)] in the 3'-untranslated region of CRTH2 showed significant evidence of linkage in the presence of disequilibrium for the 1651G allele (P = 0.003) of SNP rs545659. Haplotype analysis yielded additional evidence of linkage disequilibrium for the 1544G-1651G haplotype (P < 0.001). Population-based case-control analyses were conducted in two independent populations, and demonstrated significant association of the 1544G-1651G haplotype with asthma in an African American population (P = 0.004), and in a population of Chinese children (P < 0.001). Moreover, in the Chinese children the frequency of the 1651G allele in near-fatal asthmatics was significantly higher than mild-to-moderate asthmatics (P = 0.001) and normal controls (P < 0.001). The 1651G allele of SNP re545659 was also associated with a higher degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (P < 0.027). Transcriptional pulsing experiments showed that the 1544G-1651G haplotype confers a significantly higher level of reporter mRNA stability, when compared with a non-transmitted haplotype (1544C-1651A), suggesting that the CRTH2 gene on Chr. 11q is a strong candidate gene for asthma."

Fujii et al. found a single nuclear polymorphism (SNP) for within this gene, rs1468412 to have a positive association to schizophrenia in Japanese patients. To investigate this further, we genotyped 7 SNPs around GRM3 including rs1468412, in 752 Chinese patients with schizophrenia and 752 controls using Taqman technology. We did not detect any association between rs1468412 and schizophrenia, however we found differences in the allele frequency distribution of SNP rs2299225 (p=0.0297, odds ration [OR]=1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.99) between cases and controls. Moreover, the overall frequency of haplotypes constructed from three SNPs including rs2299225 showed significant differences between cases and controls (p=0.0017). Our results partially support the previous studies in other ethnic groups and indicate that the GRM3 gene may play an important role in the etiology of schizophrenia in the Han Chinese."

The transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) demonstrated that of these 7 SNPs, rs626716, a T to C base change at the KPNB3 locus, was the only SNP associated with schizophrenia (chi(2) = 7.71, P = 0.005) although the global P-value given by a permutation test was 0.04 for 100 permutations. Of 248 parents, 20 were heterozygous. These heterozygous parents had transmitted 4 T-alleles and 16 C-alleles to their affected offspring. To further validate the rs626716 association, we analysed a haplotype system composed of 3 SNPs at the KPNB3 locus. The result showed that the KPNB3 haplotypes were also associated with schizophrenia (chi(2) = 10.18, d.f. = 2, P = 0.006). Because the KPNB3 finding has been replicated in a Chinese population, it could be hypothesized that the KPNB3 locus may contain a disease-causing variant for schizophrenia."

15253101,15253101,Lipoprotein lipase gene polymorphisms and blood pressure levels in the Northern Chinese Han population.,"The lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene has been investigated extensively in linkage studies and in studies of its association with lipid profiles and coronary artery disease (CAD), and this gene has also been reported to have an association with hypertension. In our previous linkage study on 148 Chinese hypertensive families, the regions at or near the LPL gene were found to be associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Thus the LPL gene is a logical candidate gene for involvement in the underlying cause of essential hypertension (EH). In the present study, we identified 22 sequence variants by directly sequencing 10 exons and flanking regions of the LPL gene, and investigated the occurrence of 3 of these variants, IVS4-214C>T, 7754C>A and S447X, in a case-control study including 501 normotensive (NT) subjects and 497 EH subjects. In males, the frequencies of the genotypes of each of the 3 variants did not differ significantly between the NT and EH groups. Among the EH group in females, ANCOVA revealed no significant difference in blood pressure levels according to the 7754C>A genotype. However, in female, the distribution of the 7754C>A genotype and the frequency of the A allele of 7754C>A differed significantly between the NT and EH groups (p=0.032 and p=0.027, respectively) with 0.78 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56 to 1.07; p=0.12) of odds ratio for the A allele. Moreover, haplotype analysis revealed that T-A-C and T-C-G haplotypes (in the order of IVS4-214C>T, 7754C>A and S447X) were statistically more frequent in the NT group than in the EH group in females and males, respectively. Our indivisual single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis did not provide substantial evidence of an association between polymorphisms in the LPL gene and hypertension status and/or blood pressure levels in this cohort, but the more powerful haplotypes analysis suggested an association between the LPL gene and hypertension."

A meta-analysis we did in this work, which is based on previous nine studies plus our own unpublished data including a total of 2399 schizophrenic patients (sporadic cases 2099, familial cases >505) and more than 3261 controls, failed to show significant difference of -308G/A distribution between patients and controls in both the whole sample and the pooled Asian sample. By contraries, the significant results in the pooled Caucasian sample imply an ethnic heterogeneity in -308G/A variation in the TNF-alpha gene in schizophrenia."
15108192,15108192,Association between the FOXP2 gene and autistic disorder in Chinese population.,"Several genomewide screens indicated that chromosome 7q was linked to autistic disorder. FOXP2, located on 7q31, is a putative transcription factor containing a polyglutamine tract and a forkhead DNA binding domain. It is one member of the forkhead family who are known to be key regulators of embryogenesis. A point mutation at a highly conserved residue within the forkhead domain co-segregated with affected status in the KE family who was a unique three generation pedigree with a severe speech and language disorder and FOXP2 was directly disrupted by a translocation in an individual who had similar deficits as those of the KE family. Several studies have investigated the role of FOXP2 polymorphisms in autism and none of them found positive association. We performed a family-based association study of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FOXP2 in 181 Chinese Han trios using the analyses of transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) and haplotype. We found a significant association between autistic disorder and one SNP, as well as with specific haplotypes formed by this SNP with two other SNPs we investigated. Our findings suggest that the FOXP2 gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of autism in Chinese population."
15001631,15001631,Association of novel single nucleotide polymorphisms in the calcium channel alpha 1 subunit gene (Ca(v)1.1) and thyrotoxic periodic paralysis.,"Thyrotoxic (hypokalemic) periodic paralysis (TPP) is a frequent complication of thyrotoxicosis among Chinese men. To determine the genetic association of TPP, we studied 97 male TPP patients, 77 Graves' disease patients without TPP, and 100 normal male subjects. Mutations of the voltage-dependent calcium channel (Ca(v)1.1), sodium channel (Na(v)1.4), and potassium channel (K(v)3.4), and association of the microsatellite markers on chromosome 1 in the region of the Na/K-ATPase subunits alpha1, alpha2, and beta1 were studied. None of the TPP patients carried the known mutations in Ca(v)1.1, Na(v)1.4, and K(v)3.4 genes. There was no association of TPP with the microsatellite markers that mapped to 1p13, 1q21-23, and 1q22-25. We detected 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Ca(v)1.1 in our population, of which three were novel. Significant differences in the SNP genotype distribution between TPP compared with Graves' disease controls and normal controls were seen at the 5' flanking region nucleotide (nt) -476 (P = 0.02), intron 2 nt 57 (P < 0.01), and intron 26 nt 67 (P < 0.001). Because these SNPs lie at or near the thyroid hormone responsive element, it is possible that they may affect the binding affinity of the thyroid hormone responsive element and modulate the stimulation of thyroid hormone on the Ca(v)1.1 gene."

15214895,15214895,Genetic polymorphisms of the HCR gene and a genomic segment in close proximity to HLA-C are associated with patients with psoriasis in Taiwan.,"Although psoriasis vulgaris (PV) is strongly associated with HLA-Cw*0602, it has been proposed that the association of Cw*0602 is due to linkage disequilibrium and that other nearby genes are involved in PV susceptibility. The alpha-helix coiled-coil rod homologue (HCR) gene, located 110 kb telomeric to the HLA-C locus, is presumed to be one of the PV candidate genes. Recently, a 10-kb genomic segment, centromeric to HLA-C, defined by two new single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) n.7*A and n.9*C, was found to have a stronger association with psoriasis than the HCR gene. Until now, no study of the association of the HCR gene, SNPs n.7, and n.9 has been conducted on Chinese patients with psoriasis."
15288446,15288446,Lack of a genetic association between the frizzled-3 gene and schizophrenia in a British population.,"In recent studies, the frizzled-3 (FZD3) locus was found to be associated with schizophrenia in both Japanese and Chinese populations. To validate the initial finding, we detected three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present in a 10-kb segment of DNA at the FZD3 locus, as described in a previous study with a Chinese population. We totally recruited 120 British family trios consisting of fathers, mothers and affected offspring with schizophrenia. The transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) did not show allelic association between these three SNPs and schizophrenia. The 3-SNP haplotype system was composed of only 3 individual haplotypes among the 120 family trios and these 3 SNPs were mainly carried by two distinct haplotypes, suggesting that these 3 SNPs may result from a single founding event in history. No association was shown between the 3-SNP haplotypes and schizophrenia. The present results imply that the FZD3 gene is less evolutionary in the British population than in the Chinese population. This may be a possible reason for the failure to replicate the FZD3 finding with the British sample."

14633679,14633679,Joint effect of estrogen receptor beta sequence variants and endogenous estrogen exposure on breast cancer risk in Chinese women.,"Long-term estrogen exposure and family history of breast cancer are the two factors that are most consistently found to be associated with breast cancer risk. Sequence variants in genes involved in estrogen synthesis, metabolism, and signal transduction may account, in part, for this observation. Using data and DNA samples from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study, we tested the hypothesis that sequence variants of the estrogen receptor beta gene (ESR2) may be associated with increased risk for breast cancer, particularly among women who have a high level and long-term endogenous estrogen exposure. Direct sequencing of the ESR2 gene among 30 Chinese women revealed eight sequence variants. Association analysis of six common sequence variants in 1134 cases and 1235 controls provided evidence for positive associations between breast cancer risk and two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), [C(14206)T and C(33390)G], among postmenopausal women. Evidence of a stronger association was found for SNP [C(33390)G] among women with a long duration (> or =34 years) of menstruation (odds ratio, 2.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-4.77). A potential synergistic effect between SNP [C(33390)G] and several steroid sex hormones was observed, and a 3-4-fold elevated risk of breast cancer was found among women with a CG or GG genotype in SNP [C(33390)G] combined with a high level of steroid sex hormone or a low level of sex hormone binding globulin. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis of a joint effect of estrogen receptor beta sequence variants and endogenous estrogen exposure on breast cancer risk."
14985827,14985827,[Single nucleotide polymorphism in SCN5A and the distribution in Chinese Han ethnic group].,"Mutations in voltage-gated sodium channel type (SCN5A) may evoke severe, life-threatening disturbances in cardiac rhythm, including long QT syndrome, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (Brugada Syndrome), and isolated cardiac conduction disease. There is increasing awareness of the role of common polymorphisms in altering gene function and in susceptibility to diseases. The aim of the present study was to investigate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in SCN5A gene and the distribution of these identified SNPs in Chinese Han nationality. SCN5A gene was sequenced by fluorescent labeling automatic sequencing method in 120 unrelated samples from Han nationality in South China. Allele frequency distribution was tested by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The results showed that a total of 5 SNPs were identified in SCN5A gene, including three SNPs in code region, one SNP in regulatory region and the other in intron 23 adjacent to donor splicing site. The distribution of the SNPs in SCN5A gene was uneven. These allele frequencies in Han population of South China were as follows: G87A (A29A) 27.5%, A1673G (H588R) 10.4%, 4245+82A>G 32.8%, C5457T (D1819D) 41.3% and G6174A 44.9% respectively. The SNPs G87A (A29A), 4245+82A>G and G6174A were reported for the first time. There was no significant difference in the allele frequency of A1673G (H558R) within different ethical populations (P>0.05). C5457T (D1819D) allele frequency of Han population in South China was similar to that observed in Japanese (P>0.5), but higher than that in American (p<0.005). There was no significant difference in the distribution of the SNPs between male group and female group (all p>0.05). S1102Y and other 10 SNPs identified in other ethnic populations have not been detected in Chinese Han population. The allele distribution of SNPs was in good unity with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. It is suggested that the SNP distribution of SCN5A gene varies within different nationalities. These data will be of use for genetic association studies of acquired arrythmias and investigation of sensitivity to drug therapy."
14505215,14505215,Association of CTLA4 gene A-G polymorphism with rheumatoid arthritis in Chinese.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the allelic association of a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 1 of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA4) gene with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Chinese people. One hundred and eighty-six unrelated adults with RA and 203 randomly selected normal adults were studied. All were ethnic Chinese living in Taiwan. The CTLA4 A-G polymorphism was genotyped with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and digestion with the restriction enzyme BstEII. The genotype and allele frequencies of CTLA4 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis differed significantly from those of adult controls (P=0.022 and P=0.037, respectively). Genotype CTLA4 49 G/G and allele G were associated with an increased risk of RA (RR=1.72, 95% CI=1.15-2.57, P=0.008; RR=1.39, 95% CI=1.02-1.89, P=0.037, respectively), whereas genotype A/G and allele A were associated with protection against RA (RR=0.58, 95% CI=0.39-0.87, P=0.008 and RR=0.72, 95% CI=0.53-0.98, P=0.037, respectively). We concluded that, the CTLA4 49 A-G polymorphism is associated with RA in Chinese patients from Taiwan."
12928861,12928861,A common IL-13 Arg130Gln single nucleotide polymorphism among Chinese atopy patients with allergic rhinitis.,"Allergic rhinitis is a major public health problem and has seen its prevalence increase during the past few decades. Interleukin 13 (IL-13) has been implicated in the pathogenesis and in the regulation of immunoglobulin E (IgE) production. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found in both the coding sequence and the promoter region of IL-13, and such SNPs have been associated with allergic asthma. We have investigated whether IL-13 SNPs are associated with allergic rhinitis. Among 188 Chinese adult patients with allergic rhinitis and 87 normal controls, no significant difference was found in either allele or haplotype frequency of the SNPs between the two groups. Within patients, there was a significant association of the IL-13 Arg130Gln SNP, but not of the IL-13 promoter -1112(C/T) SNP, with serum total IgE levels. Patients with a Gln/Gln genotype showed much higher serum total IgE than those with an Arg/Arg genotype. When tested for serum-specific IgE, patients allergic to Derp 1, but not those allergic to Artemisia pollen, showed a significant association with the IL-13 promoter SNP. Thus, our results suggest a possible involvement of IL-13 SNPs in the regulation of IgE production in response to allergens in this Chinese population."
15048642,15048642,102T/C SNP in the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (HTR2A) gene and schizophrenia in two southern Han Chinese populations: lack of association.,"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) is a neurotransmitter that occupies a uniquely important place in neurobiology because of its role in many physiologic processes such as sleep, appetite, thermoregulation, pain perception, hormone secretion, and sexual behavior. Serotonin dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Previous studies have shown an association between the T102C polymorphism of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (HTR2A) gene and schizophrenia. However, many negative findings have also been reported. We analyzed the T102C polymorphism of HTR2A of schizophrenic patients in two southern Chinese populations (n = 291) and matched controls (n = 307). No significant positive association was observed between either of the polymorphisms and all schizophrenics, nor was the polymorphisms and any population of schizophrenia. These data did not provide evidence for a contribution of the 102T/C SNP of HTR2A gene to susceptibility to the southern Han Chinese schizophrenia."
14631130,14631130,Molecular genetic studies in atrial fibrillation.,"Atrial fibrillation is a complex disease. Its etiologies are diverse and genetic factors may also contribute to this disease. With the advent of modern molecular biology technology, it is now possible to explore the genetic components in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation. Past molecular genetic studies on atrial fibrillation in the literature can be divided into linkage analysis studies and association studies. The subjects for linkage analysis studies are pedigrees of probands with Mendelian hereditary atrial fibrillation. The first locus identified for autosomal dominant atrial fibrillation locates at 10q22-q24. However, the exact gene is still unknown. Another linkage analysis study in Chinese revealed that LQT1 gene (I(Ks) alpha-subunit) was the responsible gene. A missense mutation in the I(Ks) alpha-subunit results in a gain of function, which is important in causing atrial fibrillation. The third known locus for familial atrial fibrillation locates at 6q14-16. The responsible gene remains still unknown. The other type of studies takes the case-control design (association studies) and the subjects have multigenic atrial fibrillation. In a study in a Japanese population, it was reported that the angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism was not associated with atrial fibrillation. On the other hand, researchers in Taiwan reported that a nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism of the LQT5 gene (I(Ks) beta-subunit) is associated with atrial fibrillation. In summary, there is growing evidence showing that genetic factors are important in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation. We expect that more genes responsible for or contributing to atrial fibrillation will be identified in the future and these will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of atrial fibrillation."

12673692,12673692,Association of cyclin D1 (G870A) polymorphism with susceptibility to esophageal and gastric cardiac carcinoma in a northern Chinese population.,"Our aim was to investigate the association of cyclin D1 (G870A) single nucleotide polymorphism with susceptibility to esophageal and cardiac carcinoma in a northern Chinese population. By polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, cyclin D1 (G870A) genotyping was carried out among 120 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), 87 patients with gastric cardiac adenocarcinoma (CAC), and 183 age- and gender-matched controls. The cyclin D1 genotype distribution among ESCC patients was significantly different from that among healthy controls (chi(2) = 7.372, p = 0.025). The G/G genotype was significantly less frequent among ESCC patients (9.2%) than among healthy controls (20.8%) (chi(2) = 7.192, p = 0.007). The G/G genotype significantly reduced risk for the development of ESCC compared to the combination of G/A and A/A genotypes (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.16-0.83). After stratification according to smoking status, the A/A frequency among smoking ESCC (34.3%) and CAC patients (35.7%) was significantly higher than that among smoking healthy controls (18.6%) (chi(2) = 5.426 and 5.599, p = 0.020 and 0.018, respectively). Smokers with the A/A genotype had an about 2-fold increased risk for both of ESCC and CAC compared to the G/A and G/G genotypes, with an adjusted OR of 2.26 in ESCC (95% CI = 1.14-4.49) and of 2.42 in CAC (95% CI = 1.17-4.98). No correlation between the cyclin D1 genotype and development of ESCC or CAC was found among nonsmokers. Determination of the cyclin D1 (G870A) single nucleotide polymorphism may be suitable to identify individuals with increased risk for ESCC or CAC in the northern Chinese population."
12581843,12581843,A family-based association study of T1945C polymorphism in the proline dehydrogenase gene and schizophrenia in the Chinese population.,"Previous studies have reported genetic linkage evidence for a candidate gene of schizophrenia on chromosome 22q11 but no genes in this region have been really confirmed to be involved in the etiology of schizophrenia so far. Very recently, the proline dehydrogenase gene (PRODH), located in the most centromeric part of the 22q11 microdeletion region, has been reported to be strongly associated with schizophrenia from three sets of independent samples and the most significant evidence for association was derived from a single nucleotide polymorphism-PRODH*1945(T/C). We genotyped this polymorphism in 166 Chinese family trios with schizophrenia from East China. No evidence for preferential transmission of the PRODH*1945 alleles from parents to affected offsprings was found using either Transmission Disequilibrium Test (P=0.4) or Haplotype-based Haplotype Relative Risk analysis (P=0.35). Our results suggest that the 1945(T/C) polymorphism of the proline dehydrogenase gene is unlikely to play a major role in the susceptibility to schizophrenia in the Chinese population."
12438229,12438229,Correlation between a single nucleotide polymorphism in the matrix metalloproteinase-2 promoter and risk of lung cancer.,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role in several steps of cancer development. A single nucleotide polymorphism (-1306C-->T) in the MMP2 promoter sequence disrupts an Sp1 site and thus results in strikingly lower promoter activity. We examined the relationship between this polymorphism and risk for lung cancer in 781 cases and 852 age- and sex-matched controls in a Chinese population. We found that the allele frequency of MMP2-1306C was significantly higher among cases than among controls (0.91 versus 0.83). Subjects with the CC genotype had an overall 2-fold increased risk for developing lung cancer [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.18; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.70-2.79] compared with those with the CT or TT genotype. The elevated risk was observed evenly among different subtypes of this cancer. Stratified analysis indicated an additive interaction between the CC genotype and smoking on the elevated risk. The ORs of lung cancer for the CC genotype, smoking, and both factors combined were 2.38 (95% CI 1.64-3.45), 4.26 (95% CI 2.57-8.44), and 7.64 (95% CI 4.74-12.33), respectively. Furthermore, when the data were stratified by the pack-years smoked, this joint effect was more evident and stronger in heavy smokers (OR 10.25, 95% CI 5.80-18.09) than in light smokers (OR 5.55, 95% CI 3.34-9.22). These results demonstrate a significant association between the MMP2 -1306C/T polymorphism and risk of developing lung cancer solely or in a manner of interaction with carcinogen exposure."

12145552,12145552,Linkage disequilibrium mapping of quantitative trait loci under truncation selection.,"As a dense map of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are available, population-based linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping or association study is becoming one of the major tools for identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL) and for fine gene mapping. However, in many cases, LD between the marker and trait locus is not very strong. Approaches that maximize the potential of detecting LD will be essential for the success of LD mapping of QTL. In this paper, we propose two strategies for increasing the probability of detecting LD: (1) phenotypic selection and (2) haplotype LD mapping. To provide the foundations for LD mapping of QTL under selection, we develop analytic tools for assessing the impact of phenotypic selection on allele and haplotype frequencies, and LD under three trait models: single trait locus, two unlinked trait loci, and two linked trait loci with or without epistasis. In addition to a traditional chi(2) test, which compares the difference in allele or haplotype frequencies in the selected sample and population sample, we present multiple regression methods for LD mapping of QTL, and investigate which methods are effective in employing phenotypic selection for QTL mapping. We also develop a statistical framework for investigating and comparing the power of the single marker and multilocus haplotype test for LD mapping of QTL. Finally, the proposed methods are applied to mapping QTL influencing variation in systolic blood pressure in an isolated Chinese population."

12356334,12356334,Differences in N-linked glycosylation between human surfactant protein-B variants of the C or T allele at the single-nucleotide polymorphism at position 1580: implications for disease.,"Human surfactant protein-B (SP-B), a hydrophobic protein, is essential for normal lung function. SP-B is expressed and secreted by specific lung cell types, i.e. alveolar type II and Clara cells, of the respiratory epithelium. The SP-B precursor (42 kDa) undergoes post-translational processing to generate an 8 kDa mature SP-B. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at nucleotide 1580 (C/T) in exon 4 of SP-B that changes amino acid 131 from threonine to isoleucine (Thr131-->Ile) is associated with several pulmonary diseases. The Thr131-->Ile substitution can eliminate a potential N-linked glycosylation site, Asn129-Gln-Thr131, which is present in the SP-B variant of the C allele (ACT/Thr) but not in that of the T allele (ATT/Ile). To determine whether the C allele SP-B variant is indeed glycosylated at Asn(129)-Gln-Thr131, we first generated stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell lines that expressed each version of SP-B, and developed specific SP-B polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies. Using both the stably transfected cell lines and fetal lung explants, we observed that the C allele variant is indeed glycosylated at the Asn129-Gln-Thr131 site, whereas the T allele variant, which served as a control, is not. In addition, we also confirmed that both SP-B variants contain another N-linked glycosylation site, Asn311-Ser-Ser313. Given its association with several pulmonary diseases, this finding provides useful information for future studies in disease systems associated with this SNP. Further, we speculate that, given the fact that this SNP is found frequently in the general population, N-linked glycosylation at residue Asn129 interferes with SP-B processing, secretion and folding under certain disease conditions."

Yu et al., Cancer Res., 62: 6430-6433, 2002). This case control study was to assess the contribution of this MMP2 polymorphism to risk of development and metastasis of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA). MMP2 genotypes were determined by PCR-based denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography analysis and direct DNA sequencing in 356 patients with GCA and 789 frequency-matched controls in an ethnic Chinese population. We found that subjects with the CC genotype had >3-fold increased risk [adjusted odds ratio 3.36, 95% confidence interval 2.34-4.97] for developing GCA compared with those with the variant CT or TT genotype. Furthermore, the increased risk was found to be more pronounced in smokers and younger subjects. However, no significant association was demonstrated between the MMP2 polymorphism and risk of metastasis of the cancer at the time of diagnosis, with the odds ratio being 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.36-2.20) for the CC genotype. These findings are consistent with our initial observation for lung cancer and further support the hypothesis that MMP2 genotype may influence individual susceptibility to the development of certain cancer."
11774221,11774221,[Single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs)and SNP databases].,"Along the rapid development of human genome sequencing project, the variation data of human DNA sequence has become more and more useful not only for studying the origin, evolution and the mechanisms of maintenance of genetic variability in human populations, but also for detection of genetic association in complex disease such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, etc. In recent two years, the databases such as dbSNP, CGAP, HGBASE, JST and Go!Poly etc. to collect and exploit data of genomic polymorphisms mainly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been respectively established in the United States, European countries, Japan and China. This overview summarized the development and applications of those SNP databases and also discussed some issues regarding the potential improvement of accuracy of SNP data collected. China has one fifth population in the world. Therefore, development of the SNP database for Chinese populations is of importance in developing complete SNP databases of human genome and may also stimulate the further development of biomedical research and production in China."
10631153,10631153,Linkage disequilibrium and allele-frequency distributions for 114 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in five populations.,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may be extremely important for deciphering the impact of genetic variation on complex human diseases. The ultimate value of SNPs for linkage and association mapping studies depends in part on the distribution of SNP allele frequencies and intermarker linkage disequilibrium (LD) across populations. Limited information is available about these distributions on a genomewide scale, particularly for LD. Using 114 SNPs from 33 genes, we compared these distributions in five American populations (727 individuals) of African, European, Chinese, Hispanic, and Japanese descent. The allele frequencies were highly correlated across populations but differed by >20% for at least one pair of populations in 35% of SNPs. The correlation in LD was high for some pairs of populations but not for others (e.g., Chinese American or Japanese American vs. any other population). Regardless of population, average minor-allele frequencies were significantly higher for SNPs in noncoding regions (20%-25%) than for SNPs in coding regions (12%-16%). Interestingly, we found that intermarker LD may be strongest with pairs of SNPs in which both markers are nonconservative substitutions, compared to pairs of SNPs where at least one marker is a conservative substitution. These results suggest that population differences and marker location within the gene may be important factors in the selection of SNPs for use in the study of complex disease with linkage or association mapping methods."

Here we report an analysis of 63 variable genes (BV), spanning 553 kb of TCRB that yielded 279 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Samples were drawn from 10 individuals and represent four populations-African American, Chinese, Mexican, and Northern European. We found nine variants that produce nonfunctional BV segments, removing those genes from the TCRB genomic repertoire. There was significant heterogeneity among population samples in SNP frequency (including the BV-inactivating sites), indicating the need for multiple-population samples for adequate variant discovery. In addition, we observed considerable linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r(2) > 0.1) over distances of approximately 30 kb in TCRB, and, in general, the distribution of r(2) as a function of physical distance was in close agreement with neutral coalescent simulations. LD in TCRB showed considerable spatial variation across the locus, being concentrated in ""blocks"" of LD; however, coalescent simulations of the locus illustrated that the heterogeneity of LD we observed in TCRB did not differ markedly from that expected from neutral processes. Finally, examination of the extended genotypes for each subject demonstrated homozygous stretches of >100 kb in the locus of several individuals. These results provide the basis for optimization of locuswide SNP typing in TCRB for studies of genotype-phenotype association."
11393534,11393534,"Polymorphisms in PNLIP, encoding pancreatic lipase, and associations with metabolic traits.","Pancreatic lipase (EC 3.1.1.3) is an exocrine secretion that hydrolyzes dietary triglycerides in the small intestine. We developed genomic amplification primers to sequence the 13 exons of PNLIP, which encodes pancreatic lipase, in order to screen for possible mutations in cell lines of four children with pancreatic lipase deficiency (OMIM 246600). We found no missense or nonsense mutations in these samples, but we found three silent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), namely, 96A/C in exon 3, 486C/T in exon 6, and 1359C/T in exon 13. In 50 normolipidemic Caucasians, the PNLIP 96C and 486T alleles had frequencies of 0.083 and 0.150, respectively. The PNLIP 1359T allele was absent from Caucasian, Chinese, South Asian, and North American aboriginal samples, but had a frequency of 0.085 in an African sample, suggesting that it is a population-specific variant. In an association analysis of 185 African neonates, the PNLIP 1359C/T SNP genotype was significantly associated with concentrations of plasma lipoproteins. These associations were most likely due to linkage disequilibrium with another functional variant at or near PNLIP. Thus, we report three new SNPs for the PNLIP, which may serve as markers for association analyses and for pharmacogenetic studies of pancreatic lipase inhibitors."
