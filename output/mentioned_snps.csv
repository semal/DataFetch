A total of 885 subjects including 410 MetS patients and 475 healthy controls were recruited. MetS was defined based on the National Cholesterol Education Program in Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Two common SNPs of the NLRP3 gene, rs10754558 and rs4612666, were detected using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The frequencies of G allele and GG genotype of the NLRP3 rs10754558 in the MetS group were significantly higher than those of the control group. Logistic regression analysis showed that the GG genotype (OR=2.223, 95%CI: 1.296-6.924, P=0.00034) and G allele (OR=1.440, 95%CI: 1.189-4.063, P=0.00028) were associated with increased risk of MetS. NLRP3 rs10754558 GG genotype was associated with higher level of insulin resistance and visceral adiposity index. No association of NLRP3 rs4612666 SNPs with susceptibility to MetS was identified in this population. NLRP3 gene rs10754558 polymorphisms are associated with increased risk of MetS. The G allele and genotype GG are risk factors for MetS."
