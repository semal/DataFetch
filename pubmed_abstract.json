The levels of serum IL-18 and IFN-gamma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid IL-18 were elevated in patients with sarcoidosis. The polymorphisms of the IL-18 gene may play a possible role in expression regulation of the gene. We investigated the roles of the polymorphisms in the development of sarcoidosis. We examined two single nucleotide polymorphisms of the IL-18 gene in 119 patients with sarcoidosis and 130 healthy control subjects. Our results showed that the frequency of sarcoidosis patients with the CA genotype at position -607 was significantly higher than that with the AA genotype (OR = 2.200) and a significantly higher proportion of patients had the C allele at -607 compared with that of the controls (OR = 2.123). No significant differences were seen in the distribution of the genotypes or phenotype frequencies at position -137. There was no specific organ involvement associated with a certain genotype or phenotype. In IL-18 gene polymorphisms, the C allele at position -607 might be a genetic risk factor for sarcoidosis in this Japanese population.", "title": "Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the IL-18 gene with sarcoidosis in a Japanese population.", "pmid": "12366781", "id": "1"},
{"abstract": "A previous case-control study by Yang et al. indicated that the TCP1 gene in 6q25 was associated with schizophrenia in the Han population.

Our transmission disequilibrium test showed neither allele nor haplotype association with schizophrenia, and suggests that the TCP1 locus is not associated with schizophrenia in the Chinese population.

In this study, odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for apolipoprotein E (APOE), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and kallikrein (KLK1) polymorphisms were computed to test their association with the disease by a case-control study. The risk of AD was significantly increased for individuals with APOE varepsilon4 allele (OR = 3.73, 95% CI = 2.38-5.98).

{"abstract": "Multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) functions as an efflux pump of nucleoside monophosphate analogs, such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6-TGN). A single-nucleotide polymorphism in human MRP4 (rs3765534) dramatically reduces MRP4 function and results in the intracellular accumulation of 6-TGN. In this study, we investigated the association between MRP4 G2269A polymorphism and thiopurine sensitivity in Japanese IBD patients. Direct sequencing of the MRP4 exon 18 was performed. The TPMT A719G and ITPase C94A polymorphisms were determined by polymerase-chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses. Of the 279 samples analyzed (44 healthy volunteers and 235 IBD patients), 68 samples showed a heterozygote of MRP4 G2269A and 7 carried a homozygote. The allelic frequency of MRP4 G2269A was 14.7%. In 130 IBD patients treated with azathioprine/6-MP, the white blood cell count was significantly lower in patients with theMRP4 variant alone (n = 26) than in patients with a wild allelotype (n = 74) (P = 0.014) or in patients with the ITPase variant alone (n = 22) (P = 0.0095). The 6-TGN levels were significantly higher in patients with the MRP4 variant alone than in patients with the wild allelotype(P = 0.049). Of the 15 patients who experienced leucopenia (<3 x 10\u2079/l), 7 patients carried the MRP4 variant.The odds ratio of carrying the MRP4 variant alone and having leukopenia was 3.30 (95% confidence interval 1.03\u201310.57, P = 0.036).

{"abstract": "Numerous investigations on metabolic enzymes, cytochrome P450 (CYP), have been conducted since 1990. In the psychiatric field, the focus has been on CYP2D6, which is a major enzyme involved in metabolism of antidepressants and antipsychotics. Poor metabolizers (deficit metabolizers) for CYP2D6 represent 7% among Caucasians, while they accouut for less than 1% of Asians. The frequency of a mutated allele for CYP2D6*10, which leads to the decrease in CYP2D6 activity, is 40% in Asians. It has been reported that steady-state plasma concentration of haloperidol in subjects with mutated alleles for CYP2D6 is significantly higher than that in subjects without mutated alleles. At the same time, steady-state plasma concentration of risperidone is very different between CYP2D6 genotypes. In addition, several studies suggest that better efficacy or higher scores of side effects are observed in the subjects with mutated alleles for CYP2D6. Recently receptor polymorphism has become a concern and association between clinical response and polymorphism of dopamine and serotonin has been reported. In the dopamine D2, subjects with -141C Ins allele in -141C Ins/Del polymorphism and subjects with A1 allele in Taq1A have a better response to dopamine antagonists. Association between Ser allele and typical antipsychotics and between Gly allele and atypical antipsychotics has been investigated.

{"abstract": "The sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) is an essential regulatory subunit of the beta-cell ATP-sensitive K+ channel (K[ATP]). The possible role of SUR1 gene mutation(s) in the development of NIDDM remains controversial as both a positive association and negative linkage results have been reported. Therefore, we examined the SUR1 gene at the single nucleotide level with single strand conformation polymorphism analysis in 100 Japanese NIDDM patients. We identified a total of five amino acid substitutions and 17 silent mutations by examining all 39 exons of this gene. Two rare novel mutations, D811N in exon 20 and R835C in exon 21, were identified in the first nucleotide-binding fold (NBF), a functionally important region of SUR1, in one patient each, both heterozygotes. To analyze possible functional alterations, we reconstituted the mutant K(ATP) by coexpressing beta-cell inward rectifier (BIR) (Kir 6.2), a channel subunit of K(ATP), and mutant SUR1 in HEK293T and COS-7 cells. As demonstrated by the patch clamp technique and rubidium (Rb+) efflux studies, neither mutation alters the properties of channel activities. Two other rare missense mutations, R275Q in exon 6 and V560M in exon 12, were also identified. The R275Q substitution was not found in 67 control subjects, and V560M was present in three control subjects. Neither of these substitutions appeared to cosegregate with NIDDM in the probands' families. A previously reported S1370A substitution located in the second NBF was also common in the Japanese subjects (allelic frequency 0.37), and was found at an equal frequency in nondiabetic control subjects.

{"abstract": "This article summarizes a symposium that was organized by Dr. Kim Fromme and presented at the 2003 annual meeting of the Research Society on Alcoholism in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. The four presentations illustrate the emerging technologies and methods that are now being used to investigate the genetic basis of differential sensitivity to alcohol and their behavioral manifestations. Combining human genotyping with laboratory measures of behavior and subjective reports, these presentations represent state-of-the-art approaches to crossing the bridge from the Decade of the Brain to the Decade of Behavior. Dr. De Wit's paper describes her research on the neurobiological basis for individual differences in sensitivity to the stimulant and sedative effects of alcohol. Evidence suggests that activity of the dopaminergic and GABAergic neurotransmitters underlie these stimulant and sedative effects, respectively. Both Drs. Hutchison's and Corbin's papers describe their research on polymorphisms for the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) as a determinant of the subjective effects of alcohol challenge. Dr. Hutchinson's and Ms. Ray's findings indicate that individuals with the short form of the SLC6A4 alleles (S) demonstrated a low level of response to alcohol, thus supporting previous research that the S allele may be associated with increased risk for alcohol dependence. In contrast, Dr. Corbin did not find a reliable association between the SLC6A4 genotype and subjective response to alcohol. Mr. Cook's and Dr. Wall's paper adds another dimension to this article by presenting research on both the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH2) genetic variants and their association with the alcohol-related flushing response that is prevalent in Asian populations.

{"abstract": "The missense variant S180L in TIRAP (Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein) gene is implicated in attenuating TLRs signal transaction and may affect individual response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Several studies investigated the association between TIRAP S180L and risk of tuberculosis (TB), but the results were controversial. In this study, we quantitatively synthesized nine studies relevant to the association between TIRAP S180L polymorphism and TB risk with total 6584 TB cases and 7294 controls using meta-analysis. We found that the variant allele Leu180 and heterozygous genotype Ser/Leu were not significantly associated with risk of TB (allelic OR = 0.99, 95%CI: 0.88-1.11; Ser/Leu vs Ser/Ser: OR = 0.99, 95%CI: 0.87-1.13) with heterogeneity P values > 0.05.

{"abstract": "Schizophrenia is a multifactorial disorder characterized by the contribution of multiple susceptibility genes that may act in conjunction with epigenetic processes and environmental factors. The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, which is located in the 22q11 microdeletion, has been considered as a candidate gene for schizophrenia because of its ability to degrade catecholamines, including dopamine. In a genetic analysis, neurophysiological endophenotype in schizophrenia, such as smooth pursuit eye movement (SPEM) disturbance, is considered to be a good trait marker, because it may be under more direct genetic control. This study was performed to examine the genetic association of COMT polymorphisms with the risk of schizophrenia and SPEM abnormality in a Korean population. Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms of COMT were genotyped by TaqMan assay. Their genetic effects on the risk of schizophrenia were analyzed in 354 patients and 396 controls using chi(2) analyses. Among the schizophrenic patients, 166 subjects were selected for association analyses of COMT polymorphisms with SPEM abnormality. From the six COMT polymorphisms, rs6267 showed an association with the reduced risk of schizophrenia after correction (P(corr) = 0.02). In analysis of SPEM abnormality, no significant associations were detected with COMT polymorphisms. The results of the present study provide the evidence that in a Korean population, COMT on the 22q11 locus is likely involved in the development of schizophrenia, but not in the SPEM function abnormality.", "title": "Association analysis of COMT polymorphisms with schizophrenia and smooth pursuit eye movement abnormality.", "pmid": "19881467", "id": "22"},

CTLA-4 microsatellite marker loci were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA and resolution of the products on sequencing gels. GAD65 antibody was detected by radioligand binding assay. There was no significant difference in the distribution of CTLA-4 alleles between patients and controls, and no difference was observed in the prevalence of CTLA-4 alleles when GAD65 antibody-positive and -negative individuals with the type 1 diabetes were compared.

Tibia lead was assessed with a 30-min measurement by (109)Cd-induced K-shell X-ray fluorescence, and DMSA-chelatable lead was estimated as 4-hr urinary lead excretion after oral administration of 10 mg/kg DMSA. The primary goals of the analysis were to examine blood lead, tibia lead, and DMSA-chelatable lead levels by ALAD and VDR genotypes, controlling for covariates; and to evaluate whether ALAD and VDR genotype modified relations among the different lead biomarkers. There was a wide range of blood lead (4-86 microg/dL), tibia lead (-7-338 microg Pb/g bone mineral), and DMSA-chelatable lead (4.8-2,103 microg) levels among lead workers. Among lead workers, 9.9% (n = 79) were heterozygous for the ALAD(2) allele and there were no homozygotes. For VDR, 10.7% (n = 85) had the Bb genotype, and 0.5% (n = 4) had the BB genotype.

{"abstract": "The number of effectively independent tests performed in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) varies by population, making a universal P-value threshold inappropriate. We estimated the number of independent SNPs in Phase 3 HapMap samples by: (1) the LD-pruning function in PLINK, and (2) an autocorrelation-based approach. Autocorrelation was also used to estimate the number of independent SNPs in whole genome sequences from 1000 Genomes. Both approaches yielded consistent estimates of numbers of independent SNPs, which were used to calculate new population-specific thresholds for genome-wide significance. African populations had the most stringent thresholds (1.49 \u00d7 10(-7) for YRI at r(2) = 0.3), East Asian populations the least (3.75 \u00d7 10(-7) for JPT at r(2) = 0.3). We also assessed how using population-specific significance thresholds compared to using a single multiple testing threshold at the conventional 5 \u00d7 10(-8) cutoff. Applied to a previously published GWAS of melanoma in Caucasians, our approach identified two additional genes, both previously associated with the phenotype. In a Chinese breast cancer GWAS, our approach identified 48 additional genes, 19 of which were in or near genes previously associated with the phenotype.

However, there is still a lack of knowledge concerning the association of these SNPs with the susceptibility of AIS in the Chinese Han population. A gene-based association study was conducted by genotyping the 53 SNPs of a prognostic test. DNA samples of 990 female patients with AIS and 1188 age-matched healthy controls were analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction-based Invader assay. The \u03c7 test was carried out to compare the differences of genotype and allele distributions between patients with AIS and healthy controls. A total of 4 SNPs were found to present significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies between the 2 groups. Compared with normal controls, patients were found to have significantly higher allele G of rs12618119 and allele A of rs9945359. Besides, patients were found to have significantly lower allele T of rs4661748 and allele C of rs4782809 than the normal controls. BIN1, CDH13, SETBP1, and SPATA21 genes could be associated with the susceptibility of AIS. Four new predisposition genes of AIS were identified on the basis of a large-scale case-control study.

The final nomogram included type of regimen, administered dose of irinotecan, gender, age, UGT1A1 genotype, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, pre-treatment absolute neutrophil count, and total bilirubin level. The model was validated both internally (bootstrap-adjusted concordance index, 0.69) and externally (concordance index, 0.70).

Therefore the aim of the present study was to investigate the association of these two coding LOXL1 SNPs in Pakistani PEXG patients. One hundred twenty-eight Pakistani patients diagnosed with PEXG and 180 healthy controls were recruited for the study. Genomic DNA was extracted and both SNPs were genotyped by direct sequencing. Association of genotype and allele frequencies with PEXG were analyzed using the Chi-square (\u03c7(2)) test. Genotype and allele frequencies of both rs1048661 and rs3825942 were found to be significantly associated with PEXG. The GG genotypes of both LOXL1 SNPs were associated with an increased risk of developing PEXG. In addition the G alleles of rs1048661 and rs3825942 confer an increased risk for PEXG with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.98 (95% CI 1.94-4.57) and OR 6.83 (95% CI 2.94-16.67), respectively.

Overexpression and amplification of c-MET have been correlated with poor clinical outcome in gastric cancer, whereas the associations between c-MET polymorphisms and prognosis have not been well defined. We examined the prognostic impact of functional polymorphisms of the MET gene on clinical outcome in gastric cancer. Candidate polymorphisms of the MET gene were analyzed by PCR-based direct sequencing for the associations with clinical outcome across three independent cohorts, including 161 Japanese, 101 US, and 63 Austrian patients, with locoregional gastric cancer, treated with surgery. The univariable analysis showed that patients with any G (A/G or G/G genotype) allele of MET rs40239 had significantly longer disease-free survival and overall survival compared with those with the AA genotype in the Japanese cohort [hazard ratio (HR): 0.43, P=0.001, and HR: 0.47, P=0.006, respectively]; this remained significant upon multivariable analysis adjusted for age, sex, stage, and type of adjuvant therapy (HR: 0.48; P=0.009, HR: 0.50; P=0.017, respectively). However, there was no significant association of the polymorphism with clinical outcome in the US and Austrian cohorts. When stratified by sex in the Japanese cohort, male individuals, but not female individuals, with the G allele maintained a clinical outcome benefit in both univariable and multivariable analyses.

Moreover, the relevance of rs2294008 on GC prognosis was evaluated. Genomic DNA from 603 Spanish patients with primary GC, 139 with DU and 675 healthy controls was typed for the PSCA rs2294008C>T polymorphism by PCR-TaqMan assays. H. pylori infection [odds ratio (OR): 8.27; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.45-15.33] and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR: 6.54; 95% CI: 3.19-12.43) were identified as independent risk factors for DU whereas the rs2294008T allele was associated with reduced risk of developing the disease (OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.33-0.82).

Thirty-nine patients with CAD with obstructive lesions underwent follow-up coronary angiography after six months for the presence of restenosis. The 5'-flanking region containing (GT)n repeats of the HMOX1 gene was analyzed by PCR. The numbers of (GT)n repeats in the HMOX1 promoter showed a bimodal distribution. The alleles were divided into two subclasses, S25 and L25, depending on whether there were less than or equal to and more than 25 (GT)n repeats, respectively. The allele and genotype frequencies among groups were statistically not different. More subjects in the S25-carrier group had the low risk levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) for the CAD than those in the non-S25 carrier group (P=0.034). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the genotypes of (GT)n repeats were not related to CAD status.

To control the highly multiple testing, we designed three sequential steps of screening using three independent sets of pooled samples, followed by the confirmatory step using an independent sample set (>2200 case-control pairs). The first screening using pooled samples of 157 case-control pairs showed 2966 markers to be significantly associated with the disorder (P<0.05). After the second and the third screening steps using pooled samples of 150 pairs each, 374 markers remained significantly associated with the disorder. We individually genotyped all screening samples using a total of 1536 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the vicinity of ~200 kb from the 59 positive microsatellite markers.

{"abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory joint disease with a complex etiology in which environmental factors within a genetically susceptible host maneuver the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system toward recognition of autoantigens. This ultimately leads to joint destruction and clinical symptomatology. Despite the identification of a number of disease-susceptibility regions across the genome, RA's major genetic linkage remains with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which contains not only the key immune-response class I and class II genes but also a host of other loci, some with potential immunological relevance. Inside the MHC itself, the sole consistent RA association is that with HLA-DRB1, although this does not encode all MHC-related susceptibility. Indeed, in a set of Japanese patients with RA and a control group, we previously reported the presence of a second RA-susceptibility gene within the telomeric human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class III region. Using microsatellites, we narrowed the susceptibility region to 70 kb telomeric of the TNF cluster, known to harbor four expressed genes (I kappa BL, ATP6G, BAT1, and MICB). Here, using numerous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletion polymorphisms, we identify the second RA-susceptibility locus within the HLA region, as the T allele of SNP 96452 (T/A), in the promoter region (position -62) of the I kappa BL gene (P=.0062). This -62T/A SNP disrupts the putative binding motif for the transcriptional repressor, delta EF1, and hence may influence the transcription of I kappa BL, homologous to I kappa B alpha, the latter being a known inhibitor of NF kappa B, which is central to innate immunity. Therefore, the MHC may harbor RA genetic determinants affecting the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system.", "title": "Identification of I kappa BL as the second major histocompatibility complex-linked susceptibility locus for rheumatoid arthritis.", "pmid": "12509789", "id": "54"},

We further examined genetic covariates that included three single nucleotide polymorphisms shown to be associated with Lp-PLA\u2082 activity levels. The mean age was 66 years. Whites had the highest Lp-PLA\u2082 mass and activity levels, followed by Hispanics and Asians, and then African-Americans; in age and sex adjusted analyses, these differences were significant for each non-White race as compared to Whites (p < 0.0001).

{"abstract": "Schizophrenia is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder whose genetic influences remain elusive. Recent genome-wide scans revealed that rare structural variants disrupted multiple genes in neurodevelopmental pathways, which strongly implicate nitric oxide (NO) signaling in schizophrenia. NO acts as a second messenger of N-methyl-D aspartate receptor activation, which further interacts with both dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways. NO is mainly synthesized by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) in the brain, and its gene locus, 12q24.2, has attracted much attention as a major linkage region for schizophrenia. Genetic variations of NOS1 have also been associated with schizophrenia, and differential expression of NOS1 was observed in the postmortem brain of schizophrenic patients. Here, we explored the hypothesis that a putative cis-acting G-84A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs41279104) in the exon 1c promoter region of the NOS1 gene is associated with the levels of NOS1 immunoreactivity in postmortem prefrontal cortex specimens regardless of disease phenotype. Individuals with the A-allele of this SNP showed significantly lower levels of NOS1 immunoreactivity than did GG homozygotes (p=0.002). Furthermore, a case-control study using 720 individuals in a Japanese population revealed a significant association between the SNP and schizophrenia (genotypic p=0.0013 and allelic p=0.0011).

One reason could be that many genes individually have such weak effects that they cannot meet standard thresholds of genome wide significance, but as a group in specific combinations of genetic variations, they can have a strong influence. Previously we reported that such genetic signatures of 281 genetic markers associated with about 130 genes can do a relatively good job of differentiating centenarians from non\u2010centenarians particularly if the centenarians are 106 years and older. This would support our hypothesis that the genetic influence upon exceptional longevity increases with older and older (and rarer) ages. We investigated this list of markers using similar genetic data from 5 studies of centenarians from the USA, Europe and Japan. The results from the meta\u2010analysis show that many of these variants are associated with survival to these extreme ages in other studies.

The increases in FEV(1) after inhalation of procaterol hydrochloride (Delta FEV(1) procaterol) or oxitropium bromide (Delta FEV(1) oxitropium), and after sequential inhalation of procaterol and oxitropium (total airway reversibility), were measured in 81 Japanese patients with moderate to severe asthma.

{"abstract": "Our aim was to identify the role of the homeostatic chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 and their common receptor CCR7 in atherogenesis and to study the relationships between CCL19, CCL21, and CCR7 gene variants and coronary artery disease in a Chinese Han population. Immunohistochemical analysis of samples with atherosclerosis of various stages showed increased CCL19, CCL21, and CCR7 expression in atherosclerotic coronary plaques compared with nonatherosclerotic controls. Expression levels increased in positive correlation with coronary lesion stage. Cell adhesion assays confirmed that CCL19 promoted monocyte adhesion, which was induced by CCR7, to human umbilical vein endothelial cells, an effect partially antagonized by atorvastatin. After the human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with CCR7-neutralizing antibody, both CCL19- and CCL21-induced monocyte to human umbilical vein endothelial cell migration and CCL19-induced monocyte to human umbilical vein endothelial cell adhesion were abolished. The associations between genetic variants of CCL19, CCL21, CCR7, and coronary artery disease in a Chinese Han population were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The following single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with coronary artery disease: CCL19 rs2227302, CCL21 rs2812377, and CCR7 rs588019. Individuals with the CCL19 rs2227302 T allele or CCL21 rs2812377 G allele had higher plasma CCL19 levels than those with C/C genotype and higher CCL21 levels than those with T/T genotype in both case and control subjects.

{"abstract": "In the last year there has been considerable success in the identification of genes harbouring susceptibility for primary osteoarthritis. This report brings the reader up-to-date by focusing on three of the more compelling finds. A UK group reported an association of the FRZB gene with hip osteoarthritis in females. FRZB codes for secreted frizzled-related protein 3, an antagonist of Wnt signalling. The Wnt signal transduction pathway is critical for normal development and is also active in adult tissues. Secreted frizzled-related protein 3 helps to maintain articular cartilage and the associated alleles at FRZB reduce the activity of this important protein. A Japanese group has reported an association of the asporin gene ASPN with knee and hip osteoarthritis and an association of the calmodulin 1 gene CALM1 with hip osteoarthritis. Asporin is a cartilage extracellular protein that regulates the activity of transforming growth factor-beta. Calmodulin is an intracellular protein that interacts with a number of proteins involved in signal transduction. The associated alleles at ASPN and CALM1 reduce the ability of chondrocytes to express the genes encoding aggrecan and type II collagen. Since these are essential structural components of articular cartilage, the ASPN and CALM1 associations are predicted to adversely affect the maintenance of cartilage. The FRZB, ASPN and CALM1 results are compelling and highlight that polymorphism in signal transduction pathways is a major component of osteoarthritis susceptibility. This is an exciting observation since signal transduction pathways are malleable and therefore potentially amenable to intervention and modification.", "title": "Polymorphism in signal transduction is a major route through which osteoarthritis susceptibility is acting.", "pmid": "16093844", "id": "89"},

{"abstract": "It is well known that high serum uric acid (SUA) is the cause of gout and a risk factor of cardiovascular diseases. Although SUA is thought to have an association with folate metabolism through elevated production and/or damaged renal excretion, studies on functional polymorphisms of folate metabolizing are still limited, showing inconsistent findings. We hypothesized that hyperuricemia would be associated with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and thymidylate synthase (TS) 28-bp tandem repeat polymorphism. Subjects were 793 healthy health checkup examinees (272 male and 521 female Japanese) aged 39 years or older. There was no clear difference in SUA means among those with different genotypes of MTHFR and TS, but a significant association between hyperuricemia (SUA > or =7mg/dL) and MTHFR 677T allele carriers was observed. The odds ratio of harboring 677T allele adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, serum creatinine, systolic blood pressure, currents habits of smoking and drinking, and TS genotype was 2.77 (95% confidence interval, 1.38-5.56). The TS genotype was not significantly associated with hyperuricemia; the corresponding adjusted odds ratio was 1.36 (95% confidence interval, 0.75-2.48) for non-33 genotype relative to 33 genotype. Because MTHFR 677CC was rarer both in  or =7 mg/dL group, the comparisons of SUA means were not useful to elucidate the roles of the polymorphism. This new view may partly explain the inconsistent results on the association of the MTHFR polymorphism with SUA.", "title": "Significant association between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677T allele and hyperuricemia among adult Japanese subjects.", "pmid": "19917450", "id": "100"},

In this hospital based, case-control study 194 patients newly diagnosed with histologically confirmed prostate cancer were enrolled. Visitors for cancer screening served as healthy controls. We genotyped 12 PSCA gene single nucleotide polymorphisms in 194 cases and 169 healthy controls. Men with the rs1045531 AA genotype were at higher risk for prostate cancer than those with the CC genotype. Individuals with the CCCAGGTACGG haplotype were at significantly increased risk for prostate cancer.

{"abstract": "Based on the data and technology generated in previous international projects, such as the Human Genome Project and the HapMap, for the building of the common patterns of genetic variation in humans, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to HCV infection was conducted to reveal genetic effects against treatment response or the induction of side effects. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with response to pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy were determined around IL-28B in chromosome 19, and the strong association was also observed in spontaneous viral clearance regardless of population. These data imply that an important interaction between HCV infection and IL-28B is critical for viral persistence or clearance. PEG-IFN and RBV therapy is associated with a range of treatment-limiting adverse effects. One of the frequent side effects induced by the combination therapy is haemolytic anaemia. The severe anaemia requires the reduction of the RBV dose, which could lead to treatment failure. Genetic variants around inosine triphosphatase gene (ITPA) were associated with heamolytic anaemia. Interestingly, the significant SNPs observed in Europe and the United States were not strongly associated with Japanese population although all significant SNPs were located around ITPA gene, suggesting that SNPs typing using individual population are required for the collection of precise data.

This study aimed to investigate HCMV genetic polymorphisms in CRC and its correlation with the clinical outcomes. We performed PCR and sequencing of a viral immunomodulatory gene, UL144, in clinical isolates and CRC specimens. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences were aligned, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. The clinical, pathological and survival data were compared among tumours with different UL144 genotypes. HCMV was detected in 49 (47.8 %) of the tumour specimens. Genotype A predominated in 43 samples (22/43; 51.2 %) with successful sequencing, followed by genotype B (13/43; 30.2 %) and genotype C (8/43; 18.6 %). The genotypic distribution was similar to that of the clinical isolates and those reported in other Asian populations. The amino acid sequence of genotype B was the most conserved. For stage II and III CRC patients with HCMV-positive tumours, disease-free survival (DFS) varied among the three major genotypes (P50.0046). The presence of genotype B virus in the tumours was associated with a shorter DFS and independently predicted tumour recurrence in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model (hazard ratio, 5.79; 95 % confidence interval, 1.30\u201325.81; P50.021). By reverse transcription PCR, tumour samples with genotype B viruses had the highest rate of UL144 expression.

POAG is a genetically complex trait with a substantial fraction exhibiting a significant heritability. Less than 10% of POAG cases in the general population are caused by specific gene mutations and the remaining cases are polygenic. Quantitative traits related to POAG pathogenesis such as intra-ocular pressure (IOP), vertical cup/disc ratio (VCDR), optic disc area, and central corneal thickness (CCT) are highly heritable, and likely to be influenced at least in part by genes and show substantial variation in human populations.

{"abstract": "We aim to review the most recent advances in the field of epilepsy genetics with particular focus on the progress in gene discovery in monogenic epilepsies, identification of risk genes in complex genetic epilepsies and recent findings in the field of epilepsy pharmacogenomics. During the last 12 months, the use of massive parallel sequencing technologies has allowed for the discovery of several genes for monogenic epilepsies. Most importantly, PRRT2 was identified as the long-sought gene for benign familial infantile seizures. Mutations in KCNT1 were found in two seemingly unrelated monogenic epilepsies including malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy and severe autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. A genome-wide association study in idiopathic generalized epilepsy revealed the first common risk variants for human seizure disorders including variants in VRK2, PNPO and SCN1A. Furthermore, a landmark study provided evidence that screening for the HLA-B1502 variant may prevent carbamazepine CBZ-induced side effects in the Taiwanese population. Also, HLA-A3101 variants were identified as a risk factor for carbamazepine side effects in Europeans.

Previously, we reported the association of four single nuclear proteins (SNPs) in the exons of the C3 gene with childhood and adult BA. The C3 gene, however, is a large gene, and functional SNPs associated with susceptibility to BA have not yet been identified. We analyzed 26 SNPs in the C3 gene and its promoter region to narrow down the regions showing association with childhood and adult BA. Childhood and adult atopic BA patients and healthy child and adult controls were recruited from urban cities in Japan and genotyped. In SNP analysis, an SNP (SNP24, rs11569562) located in intron 31 of the C3 gene was associated with adult BA [corrected P (Pcor) = 0.030]. In linkage disequilibrium (LD) block 4 spanning exons 24-41, the frequency of the CCC haplotype in adult BA was significantly higher than that in adult controls (Pcor = 0.038).

{"abstract": "Recent large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci which harbor genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), many of which encode proteins not previously suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis of T2D. Most GWAS for T2D have focused on populations of European descent, and GWAS conducted in other populations with different ancestry offer a unique opportunity to study the genetic architecture of T2D. We performed genome-wide association scans for T2D in 3,955 Chinese (2,010 cases, 1,945 controls), 2,034 Malays (794 cases, 1,240 controls), and 2,146 Asian Indians (977 cases, 1,169 controls). In addition to the search for novel variants implicated in T2D, these multi-ethnic cohorts serve to assess the transferability and relevance of the previous findings from European descent populations in the three major ethnic populations of Asia, comprising half of the world's population. Of the SNPs associated with T2D in previous GWAS, only variants at CDKAL1 and HHEX/IDE/KIF11 showed the strongest association with T2D in the meta-analysis including all three ethnic groups. However, consistent direction of effect was observed for many of the other SNPs in our study and in those carried out in European populations. Close examination of the associations at both the CDKAL1 and HHEX/IDE/KIF11 loci provided some evidence of locus and allelic heterogeneity in relation to the associations with T2D. We also detected variation in linkage disequilibrium between populations for most of these loci that have been previously identified. These factors, combined with limited statistical power, may contribute to the failure to detect associations across populations of diverse ethnicity. These findings highlight the value of surveying across diverse racial/ethnic groups towards the fine-mapping efforts for the casual variants and also of the search for variants, which may be population-specific.", "title": "Transferability of type 2 diabetes implicated loci in multi-ethnic cohorts from Southeast Asia.", "pmid": "21490949", "id": "121"},

Recent studies suggest that TGF-beta(2) is a predominant isoform expressed in severe asthma and it is also associated with airway remodelling. To determine whether the polymorphisms in TGF-beta(2) are associated with childhood atopic bronchial asthma in a Japanese population. We identified a total of eight polymorphisms and characterized the linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping of the gene. Three variants in the promoter and 3'UTR were genotyped, and we conducted an association study of TGF-beta(2) (childhood atopic asthma n=297, normal controls n=555). An association analysis of these variants and an expression and functional analysis were performed. 3'UTR 94862T >A was found to be significantly associated with the risk of childhood atopic asthma (P=0.00041). The -109-->ACAA ins promoter variant was also associated with the risk of childhood atopic asthma (P=0.0037). TGF-beta(2) expression was observed in both the normal and asthmatic bronchial epithelium, and both real-time PCR and an ELISA showed a significant basal and TGF-beta(1)-induced TGF-beta(2) expression in the bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS2B. Furthermore, the promoter variant -109-->ACAA ins increased the TGF-beta(2) promoter-reporter activity in BEAS2B cells.

Several reports have linked GD to the region 5q12-q33; and a locus between markers D5s436 and D5s434 was specifically linked to GD susceptibility in the Chinese population. In the present study, association analysis was performed using a large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at this locus in 2811 patients with GD recruited from different geographic regions of China. The strongest associations with GD in the combined Chinese Han cohorts were mapped to two SNPs in the promoter (pSNP) of SCGB3A2 [SNP76, rs1368408, P = 1.43 x 10(-6), odds ratio (OR) = 1.28 and SNP75, -623 - -622, P = 7.62 x 10(-5), OR = 1.32, respectively], a gene implicated in immune regulation.

{"abstract": "In asthma genetics, the association of highly replicated susceptibility genes lacks consistency across populations. To identify genuine associations, we investigated the reproducibility of the 23 most promising asthma and asthma-related candidate genes in a moderately sized sample from the Japanese population. We compared the frequency of 33 polymorphisms in unrelated cases and controls and tested for their association with asthma, atopy and serum total IgE levels using allele frequency, codominant, dominant and recessive genotype models. On the basis of the consistency of our findings with previous meta-analyses and large replication studies, IL13, TNF, ADAM33, IL4RA and TBXA2R might represent common major asthma and asthma-related trait genes. Individual gene assessment was extended to the interactions between two polymorphisms using our original method. Interactions between TBXA2R and ADAM33, and IL4RA and C3 were suggested to increase the risk for childhood and all asthma (adult and childhood asthma combined).

The genome-wide association study (GWAS) variant (rs9277535; 550A/G) in the 3'UTR of the HLA-DPB1 gene that associated most significantly with chronic hepatitis B and outcomes to HBV infection in Asians had a marginal effect on HBV recovery in our European- and African-American samples (odds ratio [OR] = 0.39, P = 0.01, combined ethnic groups).

First-ever-stroke patients (n=322; cerebral infarction, n=201, intracerebral hemorrhage, n=84, and subarachnoid hemorrhage, n=37) aged 40 to 89 years were recruited from Hokuetsu Hospital, Japan. Healthy controls (n=1126) were selected from the general population in the same area. ApoE genotypes were determined by restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis. Compared with apoE epsilon3/epsilon3 subjects, epsilon2 carriers had a 2-fold risk of cerebral infarction (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.2). Among cerebral infarction patients, epsilon2 carriers had increased risks of cortical infarction (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.6) (an anatomic subtype) and atherothrombosis (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.7 to 9.0) and cardioembolism (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.6 to 14.4) but not lacunar infarction (clinical subtypes). ApoE epsilon4 carriers had a 2. 5-fold risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.4). ApoE epsilon2/epsilon2 subjects had an increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.0 to 19.7). ApoE epsilon3/epsilon4 subjects showed approximately 2-fold increased risk of atherothrombosis (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.1) and intracerebral hemorrhage (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.3). The association between epsilon2 and stroke was accentuated in subjects aged 70 years or older but not in those aged 40 to 69 years. Our study suggests that apoE epsilon2 is a risk factor for atherothrombosis, cardioembolism, and intracerebral hemorrhage, whereas epsilon4 is a risk factor for atherothrombosis, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

{"abstract": "To evaluate the effect of DNA repair gene XRCC1 polymorphisms on the risk of lung cancer in a northeastern Chinese population, we studied five cSNPs in the XRCC1 gene, three that lead to non-synonymous changes: Arg194Trp, Arg280 His and Arg399Gln and two that lead to synonymous changes: Pro206Pro and Gln632Gln. A hospital-based case-control study consisted of 247 lung cancer cases and 253 cancer-free controls matched on age, gender and ethnicity. PCR-RFLP was used for genotyping. Carriers of the minor G-allele of Pro206Pro were at significantly increased risk of lung cancer (adjusted OR=1.96, 95% CI=1.26-3.06, P=0.003). Stratified analyses revealed a significantly decreased risk of lung cancer associated with the AG/AA genotype of Arg280His (AG+AA versus GG, OR=0.38, 95% CI=0.19-0.75, P=0.005) among never smokers, although there was no interaction between Arg280His and smoking. In a haplotype analysis, a haplotype defined by Arg194Trp(C)-Pro206Pro(G)-Arg280His(G)-Arg399Gln(G)-Gln632Gln(G) was associated with increased risk of lung cancer (OR=28.60, 95% CI=2.49-331.31, P=4.45x10(-5)). No associations were observed for the other polymorphisms or haplotypes.

It has been suggested that SIPA1 polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to breast cancer. In the present study, we performed a meta-analysis to systematically summarize the possible association between SIPA1 and the risk for breast cancer. We conducted a search of case-control studies on the associations of SPIA1 with susceptibility to breast cancer in PubMed, Embase, International Statistical Institute Web of Science, Wanfang Database in China, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. Data from eligible studies were extracted for meta-analysis. Breast cancer risk associated with SIPA1 was estimated by pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Four studies on SIPA1 and breast cancer were included in our meta-analysis. Our results showed that rs746429 was associated with the risk of breast cancer. However, rs931127 and rs3741378 were not found to be associated with breast cancer in our analysis. This meta-analysis suggests that rs746429 is associated with the risk of breast cancer.

Increasing studies have been conducted on the association of CCND1 G870A polymorphism with lung cancer risk. However, the results were controversial. The aim of the present study was to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship. Meta-analyses examining the association between CCND1 G870A polymorphism and lung cancer were performed. Subgroup analyses regarding ethnicity, smoking status, histological types and source of controls were also implemented. All eligible studies for the period up to May 2012 were identified. The overall data from ten case-control studies including 5,008 cases and 5,214 controls indicated that variant A allele may have an association with increased lung cancer risk (AA vs GG: OR = 1.21; 95 % CI = 1.08-1.36, dominant model: OR = 1.09; 95 % CI = 1.00-1.19, recessive model: OR = 1.23; 95 % CI = 1.01-1.49). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, A allele may elevate lung cancer risk among Asians but not Caucasians or Mixed ethnicities. In smoking status subgroup, A allele was shown to associate with increased lung cancer risk among smokers but not non-smokers. In the subgroup analysis by histological types, increased cancer risks were shown in adenocarcinoma but not squamous cell carcinoma, under the homozygote comparison and recessive models. Collectively, the results of the present study suggest that CCND1 G870A polymorphism might be a low-penetrant risk factor for lung cancer, particularly among Asians and smokers.

{"abstract": "A strong correlation between bone mass and genetic factors has been shown in twins and family studies. Some of the genes involved would regulate bone metabolism, bone formation, and resorption, all processes that determine bone mass. One candidate genes, calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) in the parathyroid gland, regulates calcium homeostasis by sensing decreases in extracellular calcium level and effecting an increase in secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium (Ca) reabsorption in the kidney. We have investigated a possible association between the CA-repeat polymorphism at the human CASR gene locus and the bone mineral density (BMD) of radial bone in 472 postmenopausal Japanese women. Genotypes were classified into nine groups according to the number of CA repeats present, from 20 to 12. BMD was expressed as the adjusted BMD, which was the body mass index (BMI), and age-adjusted average BMD. The 247 women who had an A3 allele (228 bp, containing 18 repeats of CA) had significantly lower adjusted BMD (mean +/- SD: 0.303 +/- 0.059 versus 0.316 +/- 0.063 g/cm(2); P = 0.0308) than the participants (n = 201) who did not carry an allele of that size.

{"abstract": "Animal studies have demonstrated that glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GIP receptor (GIPR) contribute to the etiology of obesity. In humans, genomewide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GIPR gene that are strongly associated with body mass index (BMI); however, it is not clear whether genetic variations in the GIP gene are involved in the development of obesity. In the current study, we assessed the impact of GIP SNPs on obesity-related traits in Japanese adults. Six tag SNPs were tested for associations with obesity-related traits in 3,013 individuals. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that rs9904288, located at the 3'-end of GIP, was significantly associated with visceral fat area (VFA). Moreover, rs1390154 and rs4794008 showed significant associations with plasma triglyceride levels and hemoglobin A1c levels, respectively. Among the significant SNPs, rs9904288 and rs1390154 were independently linked with SNPs in active enhancers of the duodenum mucosa, the main GIP-secreting tissue. The haplotypes of these two SNPs exhibited stronger associations with VFA. Numbers of VFA-increasing alleles of rs9904288 and BMI-increasing alleles of previously identified GIPR SNPs showed a strong additive effect on VFA, waist circumference, and BMI in the subject population. These novel results support the notion that the GIP-GIPR axis plays a role in the etiology of central obesity in humans, which is characterized by the accumulation of visceral fat.

A cohort of 400 unrelated POAG patients (294 high tension glaucoma, HTG, and 106 normal tension glaucoma, NTG) and 281 unrelated control subjects were recruited. All coding exons and splicing junctions in MYOC and OPTN were screened for sequence alterations. Common polymorphisms in APOE were genotyped. Single genes were investigated by univariate and haplotype analysis, and gene-gene interactions by logistic regression and stratified analysis. Multiple comparisons were corrected by the Bonferroni method.

Disease-causing mutations in MYOC and OPTN were identified in 1.75% and 1% of POAG patients, respectively. Most of these mutations were highly conserved across species, many predicted to create new motifs or change protein secondary structures. No individual MYOC polymorphisms significantly contributed to HTG or NTG. A haplotype containing the minor allele of the MYOC IVS2+35A>G increased NTG risk (p=0.0001).

{"abstract": "Natural human skin colour is determined both by environmental exposure to ultraviolet light and through inherited genetic variation in a very limited number of genes. Variation of a non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNP; rs1426654) in the gene (SLC24A5) encoding the NCKX5 protein is associated with differences in constitutive skin colour in South Asians. The nsSNP encodes the substitution of alanine for threonine at residue 111 (A111T) near a transmembrane region required for exchanger activity, a region which is highly conserved across different species and between NCKX family members. We have shown that NCKX5 is located at the trans-Golgi network of melanocytes and functions as a potassium-dependent sodium-calcium exchanger. When heterologously expressed, the 111T variant of NCKX5 shows significantly lower exchanger activity than the A111 variant. We have postulated that lower exchanger activity causes the reduced melanogenesis and lighter skin in Thr111-positive individuals. We used gene expression microarrays with qPCR replication and validation to assess the impact of siRNA-mediated knockdown of SLC24A5 on the transcriptome of cultured normal human melanocytes (NHM). Very few genes associated with melanogenesis were altered at the transcript level except for MC1R, suggesting that SLC24A5 interacts with at least one well-characterized melanogenic signalling pathway. More surprisingly, the expression of a number of cholesterol homeostatic genes was altered after SLC24A5 knockdown, and the total cholesterol content of NHM was increased.

Since breast cancer incidence and clinicopathologic features of breast cancers are different between Japanese and Caucasian women, it is conceivable that the risk factors of breast cancer might also differ. In addition, a preliminary study has shown that the frequencies of the variant allele in the CYP1A1 gene are different among ethnic groups. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the association of CYP1A1 polymorphisms with breast cancer risk in Japanese women. The association of two CYP1A1 polymorphisms, that is, 3' noncoding region (6235(T/C)) and codon 462 (Ile/Val), with breast cancer risk was analyzed by a case-control study (195 cases and 272 controls). Variant allele 6235C carriers at the 3' noncoding region polymorphism showed a significantly (p < 0.01) reduced breast cancer risk (odds ratio 0.60; 95% CI 0.41-0.88) as compared with noncarriers, and variant allele 462Val carriers at the codon 462 polymorphism also showed a significantly (p < 0.05) reduced risk (odds ratio 0.66; 95% CI 0.45-0.96) as compared with noncarriers. The relationship between the genetic polymorphisms and clinicopathologic characteristics of breast cancers was also investigated. Variant allele 6235C carriers showed a significantly (p < 0.02) higher positivity of lymph node metastasis than noncarriers (54% versus 36%), and tumors measuring less than 2 cm were significantly (p < 0.03) more frequently observed in variant allele 462Val carriers than noncarriers (50% versus 33%).

A decrease in risk of developing AD was demonstrated for -415 AA/-180 GG genotype [OR = 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.18-0.75, P = 0.007] and -415 A/-180 G allele (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.51-0.91, P = 0.009). The HSPA5 transcriptional activity of the -415 A/-180 G allele was significantly lower than that of the -415 G/-180 del alleles, whereas induction of HSPA5 expression after ER stress was markedly increased in the cells with the -415 A/-180 G allele.

This study first reports a genome-wide association study on FCM, to explore the genetic basis of FCM and facilitate the integration of FCM with conventional individual differences research. Healthy individuals of the Korean population were classified into the four constitutional types (FCTs). A total of 353,202 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were typed using whole genome amplified samples, and six-way comparison of FCM types provided lists of significantly differential SNPs. In one-to-one FCT comparisons, 15,944 SNPs were significantly differential, and 5 SNPs were commonly significant in all of the three comparisons. In one-to-two FCT comparisons, 22,616 SNPs were significantly differential, and 20 SNPs were commonly significant in all of the three comparison groups.

{"abstract": "Surfactant protein A (SP-A) enhances phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Two functional genes, SP-A1 and SP-A2, encode human SP-A. As we showed before, baculovirus-mediated insect cell-expressed SP-A2 enhances the association of P. aeruginosa with rat alveolar macrophages (rAMs) more than does SP-A1. However, true phagocytosis (internalization) was not shown, and insect cell derived proteins lack or are defective in certain mammalian posttranslational modifications that may be important for SP-A1 and SP-A2 activity and specificity. Here we used SP-A1 (6A(2), 6A(4)) and SP-A2 (1A(0), 1A(1)) allele variants expressed by CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) mammalian cells to study their effect on association and/or internalization of P. aeruginosa by rAMs and/or human AMs (hAMs) and to study if phagocytosis can be modulated differentially and/or more effectively by CHO cell-expressed SP-A variants than by insect-cell expressed SP-A variants. For cell association and internalization assessments, light microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses were used, respectively. We found the following for the first time. (i) SP-A2 variants enhanced phagocytosis (cell association and/or internalization) of P. aeruginosa more than SP-A1 variants did, and the cell association correlated with internalization. (ii) Differences in the activities of SP-A variants were observed in the following order: 1A(1)>1A(0)>6A(2)>6A(4). (iii) rAMs, although more active than hAMs, are an appropriate model, as SP-A2 variants exhibited activity higher than that seen for SP-A1 variants with either rAMs or hAMs. (iv) CHO cell-expressed SP-A was considerably more active than insect cell-expressed variants. We conclude that SP-A2 variants stimulate phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa more effectively than SP-A1 variants and that posttranslational modifications positively influence the phagocytic activity of SP-A.", "title": "Surfactant protein A2 (SP-A2) variants expressed in CHO cells stimulate phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa more than do SP-A1 variants.", "pmid": "17220308", "id": "158"},

Fourteen articles and 19 individual studies were included for analysis. Main analyses revealed extreme heterogeneity and random effect pooled odds ratios (OR) were weakly significant in allele contrast (OR 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01, 1.63; P=0.04) and dominant model (OR 1.52; 95% CI 1.19, 1.94; P=0.0008) for T allele. Subgroup analyses for Caucasians showed marginal positive results in the dominant model. However, analyses for Asians yielded an obvious relationship to T2DM risk in all genetic models. Interestingly, T allele even seemed to be a protective factor against the development of T2DM in Blacks in allele contrast. Sensitivity analyses did not alter materially for most comparisons and no publication bias was found in this meta-analysis. The results of the present meta-analysis provide evidence that the GLUT1 rs841853 polymorphism may confer increased susceptibility to T2DM in Asians.

Of these, high-frequency alleles found at a frequency of \u22655% were 6 HLA-A (A*02:01, A*02:06, A*11:01, A*24:02, A*31:01, A*33:03), 5 HLA-B (B*15:01, B*44:03, B*51:01, B*54:01, B*58:01) and 7 HLA-DRB1 (DRB1*01:01, DRB1*04:05, DRB1*07:01, DRB1*08:03, DRB1*09:01, DRB1*13:02, DRB1*15:01) alleles. At each locus, A*02, B*15 and DRB1*04 generic groups were most diverse at allelic level, consisting of 8, 11 and 10 different alleles, respectively. Two- and three-locus haplotypes estimated by the maximum likelihood method revealed 73 A-B, 74 B-DRB1 and 42 A-B-DRB1 haplotypes with frequencies of \u22650.3%. A total of 193 A-B-DRB1 haplotypes found at a frequency of \u22650.1% were presented, and the six most common haplotypes were A*33:03-B*44:03-DRB1*13:02 (4.6%), A*33:03-B*58:01-DRB1*13:02 (3.0%), A*24:02-B*07:02-DRB1*01:01 (2.7%), A*33:03-B*44:03-DRB1*07:01 (2.5%), A*30:01-B*13:02-DRB1*07:01 (2.2%) and A*24:02-B*52:01-DRB1*15:02 (2.1%).

The aim of this study concerns the analysis of glutathione S-transferase (GST) GSTM1, GSTP1 and GSTT1 genetic variants and five polymorphisms at the TP53 gene, which are related to cancer susceptibility, in an urban/admixed population and five Amerindian tribes (Bari, Panare, Pemon, Warao and Wayuu) from Venezuela. Genotyping was carried out in 120 individuals from an urban sample and 188 Amerindians. The analysis performed on TP53 haplotype and GST allele distribution showed a close correlation for Pemon and Warao populations, while Bari group appears isolated from the other populations. GSTT1 null variant frequency in our admixed (11%) and native samples (0.0-11.4%) was lower when compared with Caucasians, Africans and Asians. Frequency of the GSTP1*Val cancer-associated allele found in Bari (88.6%) and Panare (63.0%) is of the highest so far reported. Fourteen TP53 haplotypes were observed in the admixed populations, whereas only 3 to 5 in Amerindians. To our knowledge this is the first report of GST polymorphisms and TP53 haplotype distribution in Venezuelans. The distribution of most of analyzed polymorphisms in the urban sample is consistent with the admixed origin of the present-day population of Venezuela. While, the inter-ethnic variations in genetic polymorphisms found in Native American tribes seem to be the result of the influence of demographic factors.

To test this hypothesis, this study examined the association between the +61 A>G polymorphism in the 5'-untranslated region of the EGF gene and the risk of lung cancer in a Korean population. The EGF+61 A>G genotype was determined in 432 lung cancer patients and 432 healthy age- and gender-matched control subjects.

Whole-exome sequencing identified two heterozygous AP4E1 coding variants, c.1549G>A (p.Val517Ile) and c.2401G>A (p.Glu801Lys), that co-segregate with persistent developmental stuttering in a large Cameroonian family, and we observed the same two variants in unrelated Cameroonians with persistent stuttering. We found 23 other rare variants, including predicted loss-of-function variants, in AP4E1 in unrelated stuttering individuals in Cameroon, Pakistan, and North America. The rate of rare variants in AP4E1 was significantly higher in unrelated Pakistani and Cameroonian stuttering individuals than in population-matched control individuals, and coding variants in this gene are exceptionally rare in the general sub-Saharan West African, South Asian, and North American populations. Clinical examination of the Cameroonian family members failed to identify any symptoms previously reported in rare individuals carrying homozygous loss-of-function mutations in this gene. AP4E1 encodes the \u03b5 subunit of the heterotetrameric (\u03b5-\u03b24-\u03bc4-\u03c34) AP-4 complex, involved in protein sorting at the trans-Golgi network. We found that the \u03bc4 subunit of AP-4 interacts with NAGPA, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the mannose 6-phosphate signal that targets acid hydrolases to the lysosome and the product of a gene previously associated with stuttering.

The imbalance of T-helper 1 (Th1)/Th2 cells is critical in the pathogenesis of SLE. The T-cell immunoglobulin mucin (TIM) proteins comprise a family of cell surface molecules expressed on T cells that regulate Th1- and Th2-cell-mediated immunity. Recent work has found increased expression of TIM-1 and TIM-3 ligand (galactin-9) mRNA in SLE patients and implied that TIM proteins might be involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. In this study, genotyping of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed for TIM-1 (rs1501909 and rs12522248) and TIM-3 (rs9313439 and rs10515746) in 202 SLE patients and 217 healthy individuals in a Chinese population. Results showed no significant differences existed between the patients with SLE and the controls as well as SLE patients with nephritis and those without nephritis, in all four SNPs.

Each polymorphism was tested in controls to ensure its fit with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by conditional logistic regression analysis to estimate the association between genetic polymorphisms and the risk of gastric and colorectal cancers. Twenty-one SNPs in nine genes were associated with the risk of gastric cancer (P < 0.05) and 15 SNPs in nine genes were associated with the risk of colorectal cancer (P < 0.05).

However, any possible association between this polymorphism and sdLDL profiles is unclear. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of the polymorphism of the beta(3)-AR gene on LDL particle size and sdLDL in a rural Japanese population. Among 277 subjects, body mass index, blood pressure, fasting serum insulin levels, and insulin resistance index (fasting glucose x fasting insulin/405) were determined. The polymorphism of the beta(3)-AR gene was assessed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism using buccal samples. Low-density lipoprotein particle size and sdLDL were measured with the electrophoretic separation of lipoproteins on the LipoPrint System (Quantimetrix, Redondo Beach, CA). The frequency of the beta(3)-AR allele was 0.19. In Arg carriers (Trp/Arg or Arg/Arg), the mean value of LDL particle size was smaller than that of non-Arg carriers (Trp/Trp) (P < .05). The area percentage of sdLDL was higher in Arg carriers (P < .05) than in non-Arg carriers. A multiple regression analysis showed that the area percentage of sdLDL was correlated with the polymorphism of the beta(3)-AR gene (P < .05), independently of age, sex, body mass index, smoking, and insulin resistance index.

{"abstract": "We evaluated the clinical usefulness of a genetic risk score (GRS) based on 14 well-established variants for type 2 diabetes. We analyzed 14 SNPs at HHEX, CDKAL1, CDKN2B, SLC30A8, KCNJ11, IGF2BP2, PPARG, TCF7L2, FTO, KCNQ1, IRS-1, GCKR, UBE2E2, and C2CD4A/B in 1,487 Japanese individuals (724 patients with type 2 diabetes and 763 control subjects). A GRS was calculated according to the number of risk alleles by counting all 14 SNPs (T-GRS) as well as 11 SNPs related to \u03b2-cell function (\u03b2-GRS) and then assessing the association between each GRS and the clinical features. Among the 14 SNPs, 4 SNPs were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes in the present Japanese sample (P < 0.0036). The T-GRS was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes (P = 5.9 \u00d7 10(-21)). Among the subjects with type 2 diabetes, the \u03b2-GRS was associated with individuals receiving insulin therapy (\u03b2 = 0.0131, SE = 0.006, P = 0.0431), age at diagnosis (\u03b2 = -0.608, SE = 0.204, P = 0.0029), fasting serum C-peptide level (\u03b2 = -0.032, SE = 0.0140, P = 0.022), and C-peptide index (\u03b2 = -0.031, SE = 0.012, P = 0.0125).

{"abstract": "Do genetic associations identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of age at menarche (AM) and age at natural menopause (ANM) replicate in women of diverse race/ancestry from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) Study? We replicated GWAS reproductive trait single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in our European descent population and found that many SNPs were also associated with AM and ANM in populations of diverse ancestry. Menarche and menopause mark the reproductive lifespan in women and are important risk factors for chronic diseases including obesity, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Both events are believed to be influenced by environmental and genetic factors, and vary in populations differing by genetic ancestry and geography. Most genetic variants associated with these traits have been identified in GWAS of European-descent populations. A total of 42 251 women of diverse ancestry from PAGE were included in cross-sectional analyses of AM and ANM. SNPs previously associated with ANM (n = 5 SNPs) and AM (n = 3 SNPs) in GWAS were genotyped in American Indians, African Americans, Asians, European Americans, Hispanics and Native Hawaiians. To test SNP associations with ANM or AM, we used linear regression models stratified by race/ethnicity and PAGE sub-study. Results were then combined in race-specific fixed effect meta-analyses for each outcome. For replication and generalization analyses, significance was defined at P < 0.01 for ANM analyses and P < 0.017 for AM analyses. We replicated findings for AM SNPs in the LIN28B locus and an intergenic region on 9q31 in European Americans. The LIN28B SNPs (rs314277 and rs314280) were also significantly associated with AM in Asians, but not in other race/ethnicity groups. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns at this locus varied widely among the ancestral groups. With the exception of an intergenic SNP at 13q34, all ANM SNPs replicated in European Americans. Three were significantly associated with ANM in other race/ethnicity populations: rs2153157 (6p24.2/SYCP2L), rs365132 (5q35/UIMC1) and rs16991615 (20p12.3/MCM8). While rs1172822 (19q13/BRSK1) was not significant in the populations of non-European descent, effect sizes showed similar trends. Lack of association for the GWAS SNPs in the non-European American groups may be due to differences in locus LD patterns between these groups and the European-descent populations included in the GWAS discovery studies; and in some cases, lower power may also contribute to non-significant findings. The discovery of genetic variants associated with the reproductive traits provides an important opportunity to elucidate the biological mechanisms involved with normal variation and disorders of menarche and menopause. In this study we replicated most, but not all reported SNPs in European descent populations and examined the epidemiologic architecture of these early reported variants, describing their generalizability and effect size across differing ancestral populations.

This case-control study included of 93 aggressive periodontitis (AgP) patients, 372 chronic periodontitis (CP) patients and 158 healthy controls (HC). The FcgammaRIIIb genotypes were determined by PCR using allele-specific primers. The risk for periodontitis associated with genotypes was calculated as the odds ratio (OR). A significant difference was observed in the distribution of the FcgammaRIIIb genotype between either AgP and HC, or AgP and CP, but not between CP and HC. The OR for carriage of the NA2 allele (NA1NA2+NA2NA2 versus NA1NA1) in AgP was 3.27 [95% confidence interval (CI)=1.57-7.51, p=0.0027] and 2.94 (95% CI=1.49-6.48, p=0.0037), as compared with HC and CP. After adjusting for possible confounding factors, the association was still significant.

Four SNPs (HGF -1652 C/T, +44222 C/T, and +63555 G/T, and c-met -980 T/A) were analyzed in 159 SSc patients and 103 healthy control subjects with the use of a polymerase chain reaction-based assay. The influence of the HGF -1652 SNP on transcription activity was evaluated with a luciferase reporter assay and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). There was no difference in the distribution of HGF/c-met SNPs between SSc patients and controls. HGF -1652 TT was found much more frequently in SSc patients with end-stage lung disease (ESLD) than in those without (41% versus 8%; P = 0.0004). This association was confirmed by a replication study involving a separate cohort of 155 SSc patients. Kaplan-Meyer analysis revealed that HGF -1652 TT carriers had a higher probability of developing ESLD than did CT or CC carriers. The HGF promoter carrying the HGF -1652 T allele had lower transcription activity than did the promoter carrying the C allele. EMSA showed the presence of a potential negative transcription regulator that binds specifically to the HGF promoter carrying a T allele at position -1652.

The study included 428 young Chinese adults with CCA IMT measured using a high-resolution B-mode tomographic ultrasound system. We created a genetic risk score (GRS) by summing the risk alleles of 6 obesity-associated genetic variants confirmed in our previous analyses. The GRS was significantly associated with greater CCA IMT (p<0.001) after adjustment for age and gender. Per 2 alleles of the GRS was related to 0.023 mm increment in IMT. The association was attenuated by one half with additional adjustment for obesity status, but remained significant (p=0.009). In addition, we found that blood pressure significantly modified the association between the GRS and CCA IMT (p for interaction=0.001). The associations between the GRS and CCA IMT were stronger in participants with systolic blood pressure (SBP) \u2265120 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) \u226580 mmHg (per 2 allele increment of the GRS relating to 0.028 mm greater CCA IMT, p for trend<0.001) than those with SBP<120 mmHg and DBP<80 mmHg (per 2 allele increment of the GRS relating to 0.001 smaller CCA IMT, p for trend=0.930).

Analyses of the association between rs1165196 and gout were then conducted, focusing especially on renal underexcretion (RUE) gout. Immunohistochemical analysis and functional analysis using Xenopus oocytes were also performed. Single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1165196 significantly decreased the risk of RUE gout (odds ratio 0.73, P = 0.031) but did not confer a risk for all gout (P = 0.123).

{"abstract": "Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (E.C. 1.14.17.1; protein abbreviation: DbetaH) catalyzes conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine. Previous work identified two expressed alleles of the gene encoding DbetaH (locus symbol DBH), containing either G or T at nucleotide position 910, resulting in specification by codon 304 of alanine (DBH*304A) or serine (DBH*304S), respectively. The current study employed denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to identify these alleles, and after developing a PCR RFLP for rapid genotyping, estimated the frequencies of the alleles in African-Americans, European-Americans, and in several geographically dispersed populations (Mbuti, Danes, Adygei, Chinese, Japanese, Surui, Maya, and Nasioi). DBH*304A was the most common allele in all populations tested, with allele frequencies greater than 0.80 in each case. There was significant heterogeneity in allele frequency across population groups. The DBH*304S allele was most common in subjects of African descent, and least common in East Asians and individuals from indigenous populations of North and South America. The frequency of DBH*304S was significantly higher in African-Americans (0.16) than in European-Americans (0.06; P < 0.004). Of the four DBH*304S homozygotes observed, all were Europeans and three of the four were Danes. Based on empirical P-values generated by computer simulation, the observed proportions of DBH*304S homozygotes did not differ significantly from Hardy-Weinberg expectations in any of the populations after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The observation of significant heterogeneity in DBH*304S allele frequency across different population samples demonstrates the importance of controlling for population stratification in future studies testing for associations between DBH*304S and clinical phenotypes.", "title": "Population genetics of a functional variant of the dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene (DBH).", "pmid": "9259372", "id": "208"},

We have utilized oligonucleotide probes to further identify the DR2 specificity and its molecular subtypes on the basis of specific DNA sequences as they occur in a select sample from the Asian Indian population. In addition, oligonucleotide typing of HLA-DQA1 and -DQB1 genes allowed us to determine specific associations of DRB1, DRB5, DQA1, and DQB1 alleles in DR2 individuals. A set of 60 oligonucleotide probes were hybridized to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA from DR2 homozygous or heterozygous individuals. The most common DR2 subtypes that occurred in this selected population are: DRB1*1501 (60%), DRB1*1502 (33.8%), and DRB1*1602 (6.2%). No example of DRB1*1601 was detected. By combining these results with the allelic variations at DQA1 and DQB1, we were able to detect at least seven different haplotypes, the most common being DRB1*1502-DRB5*0102-DQA1*0103-DQB1*0601 and DRB1*1501-DRB5*0101-DQA1*0102-DQB1*0502.

Recent studies have suggested that a T29 --> C polymorphism in the signal sequence region of the TGF-beta1 gene may be related to bone mineral density (BMD) and bone loss in postmenopausal Japanese women. In the present study, we examined the relationship between this polymorphism and BMD in a population-based sample of 102 estrogen-deficient postmenopausal women from the Heidelberg cohort of the European Vertebral Osteoporosis Study (EVOS). Average BMD in women with the TT genotype was approximately 10% higher at both the lumbar spine and the femoral neck compared with women with the CC genotype (spine: 980 vs. 887 mg/cm2, P = 0.05; femoral neck: 755 vs. 674 mg/cm2; P = 0.02). Women with the TT genotype also experienced less overall bone loss at the total hip, compared with women with the CC genotype. Serum levels of TGF-beta1 were higher in women with the TT genotype than in those with the CC genotype (46.5 ng/ml vs. 32.3 ng/ml, P = 0.001). These data are clearly in contrast to findings in postmenopausal Japanese women where the CC genotype was associated with higher BMD and decreased bone loss.

Anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, abdominal fat area and blood lipid profiles were compared between the 2 groups, and the association of Ala allele frequency in PPARgamma2 gene with obesity or hypertension was evaluated. Most anthropometric parameters and blood lipid profiles did not differ significantly between the genotypes. However, all variables of skinfold thickness, body circumference and abdominal fat area of Pro12Ala heterozygous were consistently higher compared to the Pro12Pro homozygous subjects without a significance differences. The hypertensive group had significantly higher (p = 0.004) Ala12 allele frequency than the normotensive group whereas allele frequencies did not differ significantly between the obese group and non-obese group.

UBE2L3 encodes an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, UBCH7, involved in cell proliferation and immune function. In this study, we sought to further characterize the genetic association in the region of UBE2L3 and use molecular methods to determine the functional effect of the risk haplotype. We identified significant associations between variants in the region of UBE2L3 and SLE in individuals of European and Asian ancestry that exceeded a Bonferroni-corrected threshold (P<1 \u00d7 10(-4)). A single risk haplotype was observed in all associated populations. Individuals harboring the risk haplotype display a significant increase in both UBE2L3 mRNA expression (P=0.0004) and UBCH7 protein expression (P=0.0068). The results suggest that variants carried on the SLE-associated UBE2L3 risk haplotype influence autoimmunity by modulating UBCH7 expression.", "title": "A functional haplotype of UBE2L3 confers risk for systemic lupus erythematosus.", "pmid": "22476155", "id": "226"},

We also performed meta-analysis of our studies, with previously published data, of several recently purported CRC risk loci. We failed to find convincing evidence for a previously reported genome-wide association at rs11903757 (2q32.3). Of the three additional loci for which evidence of an association in Europeans has been previously described we failed to show an association between rs59336 (12q24.21) and CRC risk. However, for the other two SNPs, our analyses demonstrated new, formally significant associations with CRC.

The study was performed on 309 patients with abdominal discomfort and 146 healthy controls. -196 to -174del polymorphism of TLR2 was investigated by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction method in all of the subjects. Gastritis scores of antral gastric mucosa were assessed according to the updated Sydney system in H. pylori-positive subjects (n = 156). Patients with abdominal discomfort was consisted of 80 gastric ulcers (25.9%), 38 duodenal ulcers (12.3%), five gastric + duodenal ulcers (1.6%), 105 patients with gastritis (34.0%) and 81 normal healthy stomachs (26.2%). We did not find any association between TLR2 polymorphism and risk of gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastric and duodenal ulcer and gastritis compared to healthy controls. However, the TLR2-196 to -174ins allele was associated with severity of intestinal metaplasia in more than 60 years of ages (P = 0.02).

However, in China, one of the endemic areas for HBV infection, no reports have been published on occult HBV infection. The present study investigated the virological features and the mechanism of occult HBV infection in China. Full-length HBV DNA from eight patients with occult HBV infection (S1-S8) and three HBsAg-positive cases (SWT1-SWT3) was cloned and sequenced. Additionally, four entire linear HBV genomes from occult cases were transfected transiently into HepG2 cells. The sequencing results showed two major mutations in patients with occult HBV infection as follows: deletions in the pre-S1 (S3, S4, and S7) and X (S1, S2, and S5) regions. Such deletions covered the S promoter and the basal core promoter (BCP), and function analysis of these variants also showed a decrease in DNA replication and antigen expression. Two patients with occult infection (S6 and S8) had no mutations capable of interfering with viral replication and gene expression in the major viral population. Thus, the deletions in the S promoter and the BCP regions that disable the regulatory elements may be the reason for the absence of HBsAg, and multiple mechanisms may be responsible for occult HBV infection.", "title": "Molecular characterization and functional analysis of occult hepatitis B virus infection in Chinese patients infected with genotype C.", "pmid": "19319940", "id": "231"},
{"abstract": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes fatal neurological disease in humans, is one of the most important emerging pathogens of public health significance. JEV represents the JE serogroup, which also includes West Nile, Murray Valley encephalitis, and St. Louis encephalitis viruses. Within this serogroup, JEV is a vaccine-preventable pathogen, but the molecular basis of its neurovirulence remains unknown. Here, we constructed an infectious cDNA of the most widely used live-attenuated JE vaccine, SA14-14-2, and rescued from the cDNA a molecularly cloned virus, SA14-14-2MCV, which displayed in vitro growth properties and in vivo attenuation phenotypes identical to those of its parent, SA14-14-2. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of neurovirulence, we selected three independent, highly neurovirulent variants (LD50, 1.5\u00d7105 PFU) by serial intracerebral passage in mice. Complete genome sequence comparison revealed a total of eight point mutations, with a common single G1708\u2192A substitution replacing a Gly with Glu at position 244 of the viral E glycoprotein. Using our infectious SA14-14-2 cDNA technology, we showed that this single Gly-to-Glu change at E-244 is sufficient to confer lethal neurovirulence in mice, including rapid development of viral spread and tissue inflammation in the central nervous system. Comprehensive site-directed mutagenesis of E-244, coupled with homology-based structure modeling, demonstrated a novel essential regulatory role in JEV neurovirulence for E-244, within the ij hairpin of the E dimerization domain. In both mouse and human neuronal cells, we further showed that the E-244 mutation altered JEV infectivity in vitro, in direct correlation with the level of neurovirulence in vivo, but had no significant impact on viral RNA replication. Our results provide a crucial step toward developing novel therapeutic and preventive strategies against JEV and possibly other encephalitic flaviviruses.

We evaluated genetic variation in the PRL and PRL receptor (PRLR) genes as predictors of plasma PRL levels and breast cancer risk among African-American, Native Hawaiian, Japanese-American, Latina, and White women in the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC). We selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from both the public (dbSNP) and private (Celera) databases to construct high density SNP maps that included up to 20 kilobases (kb) upstream of the transcription initiation site and 10 kb downstream of the last exon of each gene, for a total coverage of 59 kb in PRL and 210 kb in PRLR. We genotyped 80 SNPs in PRL and 173 SNPs in PRLR in a multiethnic panel of 349 unaffected subjects to characterize linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype patterns. We sequenced the coding regions of PRL and PRLR in 95 advanced breast cancer cases (19 of each racial/ethnic group) to uncover putative functional variation. A total of 33 and 60 haplotype \"tag\" SNPs (tagSNPs) that allowed for high predictability (Rh2 > or = 0.70) of the common haplotypes in PRL and PRLR, respectively, were then genotyped in a multiethnic breast cancer case-control study of 1,615 invasive breast cancer cases and 1,962 controls in the MEC. We also assessed the association of common genetic variation with circulating PRL levels in 362 postmenopausal controls without a history of hormone therapy use at blood draw. Because of the large number of comparisons being performed we used a relatively stringent type I error criteria (p < 0.0005) for evaluating the significance of any single association to correct for performing approximately 100 independent tests, close to the number of tagSNPs genotyped for both genes.

For the total population and for male subjects, the distribution of the dominant model of rs1558139 (CC vs. CT+TT) differed significantly between the EH patients and control subjects (p=0.037 and p=0.005, respectively), with a higher percentage of EH patients showing the CC genotype. Logistic regression showed that, for men, the CC genotype of rs1558139 was more prevalent in the EH patients than in the control subjects (p=0.026), while, for the total population, the difference disappeared (p=0.247). For men, the overall distribution of the haplotypes was significantly different between the EH patients and the control subjects (p=0.042), and the frequency of the T-T-G haplotype was also significantly lower for EH patients than for control subjects (p=0.009). In conclusion, the present results indicate that rs1558139 might be a genetic marker for EH and the T-T-G haplotype might be a protective genetic marker for EH in Japanese men.", "title": "Haplotype-based case-control study of the human CYP4F2 gene and essential hypertension in Japanese subjects.", "pmid": "18971550", "id": "244"},
{"abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of legal blindness among older individuals of industrialized countries. In neovascular AMD, which is an advanced stage of AMD, choroidal neovascularization develops underneath the macula and destroys central vision. Oxidative stress is a hypothesized pathway for the pathophysiology of AMD. CD36 was chosen as a candidate gene for neovascular AMD because the protein plays an important role in this pathway as well as in angiogenesis and in maintaining chorioretinal homeostasis. We tested 19 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across CD36 for their association with the disease in a Japanese population comprising 109 neovascular AMD subjects and 182 unrelated controls. Five of the 19 SNPs demonstrated a nominally significant association with neovascular AMD (P < 0.05), of which two (rs3173798 and rs3211883) withstood Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (rs3173798, nominal P = 9.96 x 10-4, allele-specific odds ratio = 0.55; rs3211883, nominal P = 2.09 x 10-4, allele-specific odds ratio = 0.50). Population structure analyses excluded stratification artifacts in our study cohort. This study supports the candidacy of CD36 as a novel susceptibility gene for neovascular AMD.

To explore whether mutation in GBA is also associated with PD in Mainland China, we have now a case control study. The occurrence of the GBA L444P mutation was analyzed in an independent cohort of PD patients and controls from Mainland China. This mutation was present in 20/616 (3.2%) of PD compared with 1/411 (0.2%) of controls (odds ratio, OR=13.76, 95% Confidence interval, CI: 1.84-102.92, p=0.001). All carriers harbored the heterozygous genotype. In a subset analysis, the frequency of this mutation was higher both in early onset (EOPD) and late onset PD (LOPD) than in controls. However, no difference in clinical characteristics, such as gender, age at onset, onset symptoms, Hoehn-Yahr stage and UPDRS, was found between L444P carriers and non-carriers. In addition, we also explored the potential relationship between GBA L444P mutation and LRRK2 G2385R and R1628P variants in patients with PD. But no association was found, either.

Genotyping of -262A/T (rs2295614) and -188A/G (rs2295613) in SLAM was carried out in 248 cases and 278 controls. Promoter activities of haplotypes on the SLAM gene were evaluated with the dual-luciferase reporter system. The mRNA expressions of SLAM on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of SLE patients with different genotypes were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Frequencies of -262A allele and -188G allele were significantly higher in SLE patients than in controls. Haplotype analysis and multifactorial logistic regression analysis showed that individuals with the AG/AG haplotype had increased susceptibility to SLE (p = 0.002, OR 1.478, 95% CI 1.152-1.897). In response to PHA stimulation, the SLAM mRNA expression on PBMC of SLE patients was significantly higher in -262A-188G haplotype homozygotes compared with -262A-188G heterozygotes and individuals with other genotypes.

Several studies have attempted to identify the genetic determinants of metabolic syndrome (MetS), though no study has revealed a cis- or trans-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that affects plasma adiponectin levels, except the adiponectin structure gene and genes encoding adiponectin-regulatory proteins. We performed a genome-wide association study in regards to plasma adiponectin concentrations in 3,310 Japanese subjects. We identified the strongest statistically associated SNP (rs4783244) with adiponectin levels (P = 3.8 \u00d7 10(-19)) in the first intron of CDH13 (T-cadherin) gene in a 30-kb haplotype block covering the promoter region to first intron.

The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I) are considered to be associated with HDL-C metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the CETP gene Taq I B and Apo A-I gene Msp I polymorphisms and plasma lipid levels taking into account environmental factors, and to determine the combined effects of these polymorphisms on HDL-C levels in Japanese women. The study involved 270 Japanese women aged 30-69 years. We found a significant association between the CETP genotypes and HDL-C levels (p=0.0020), which were also associated with the Apo A-I gene (M1) polymorphism. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that both the CETP Taq I B and Apo A-I gene (M1) genotypes were independent predictive variables. The strength of the association between the Apo A-I (M1) subgroup and HDL-C levels was reduced in the subjects with a high Body Mass Index (BMI). The combination of genotypes provided more detailed information about HDL-C levels. The \"high risk\" combination of the M1+ (M1+/+) and B1B1 genotypes was associated with the lowest HDL-C level (1.52+/-0.36 mmol/L), and the \"low risk\" combination of the M1- (M1+/- or M1-/-) and B2B2 genotypes was associated with the highest HDL-C levels (2.06+/-0.34 mmol/L).

We compared the distribution frequencies of GNLY polymorphisms between an HBV-induced chronic liver disease (CLD) group and a spontaneous recovery (SR) control group to determine whether GNLY polymorphisms play a role in HBV clearance. A total of 117 patients in the SR group and 230 patients in the CLD group were enrolled. Samples derived from complex infections, including hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus, and those associated with insufficient clinical information (10 samples in SR and 24 samples in CLD) were excluded from the study. The final analysis included 107 SR and 206 CLD samples. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood, and GNLY genotypes were determined by the GoldenGate(\u00ae) method. The genotype distribution of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2886767 (C>T), rs1561285 (G>C), and rs11127 (T>C) were significantly different between the SR and CLD groups in a recessive model (p<0.015).

{"abstract": "Asthma genetics has been extensively studied and many genes have been associated with the development or severity of this disease. In contrast, the genetic basis of allergic rhinitis (AR) has not been evaluated as extensively. It is well known that asthma is closely related with AR since a large proportion of individuals with asthma also present symptoms of AR, and patients with AR have a 5-6 fold increased risk of developing asthma. Thus, the relevance of asthma candidate genes as predisposing factors for AR is worth investigating. The present study was designed to investigate if SNPs in highly replicated asthma genes are associated with the occurrence of AR. A total of 192 SNPs from 21 asthma candidate genes reported to be associated with asthma in 6 or more unrelated studies were genotyped in a Swedish population with 246 AR patients and 431 controls. Genotypes for 429 SNPs from the same set of genes were also extracted from a Singapore Chinese genome-wide dataset which consisted of 456 AR cases and 486 controls. All SNPs were subsequently analyzed for association with AR and their influence on allergic sensitization to common allergens. A limited number of potential associations were observed and the overall pattern of P-values corresponds well to the expectations in the absence of an effect. However, in the tests of allele effects in the Chinese population the number of significant P-values exceeds the expectations. The strongest signals were found for SNPs in NPSR1 and CTLA4. In these genes, a total of nine SNPs showed P-values <0.001 with corresponding Q-values <0.05. In the NPSR1 gene some P-values were lower than the Bonferroni correction level. Reanalysis after elimination of all patients with asthmatic symptoms excluded asthma as a confounding factor in our results. Weaker indications were found for IL13 and GSTP1 with respect to sensitization to birch pollen in the Swedish population. Genetic variation in the majority of the highly replicated asthma genes were not associated to AR in our populations which suggest that asthma and AR could have less in common than previously anticipated.

In particular, lachrymal/salivary gland lesions tend to manifest in a highly active AIP disease state, and several genes are speculated to be associated with the onset of this complication. We therefore searched for candidate susceptibility genes related to lachrymal/salivary gland lesions in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with the GeneChip Human Mapping 500k Array Set (Affymetrix, CA) that was followed by fine mapping of additional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in strongly significant genes with TaqMan assays. Venous blood samples were obtained from 50 type 1 AIP patients with lachrymal/salivary gland lesions (A group) and 53 type 1 AIP patients without (B group). The mean values of IgG and IG4 were both significantly different (P<0.05) between the groups. SNPs that showed a significant association with the A group at the genome-wide level (P<0.0001) were identified and subsequently used in fine SNP mapping of candidate genes.

All the calculations were performed using STATA version 11.0. Three common nonsynonymous polymorphisms in XRCC1, codon 194, codon 280 and codon 399, and two common nonsynonymous polymorphisms in ERCC2, codon 312 and codon 751, were analyzed. The result showed in total population, Lys751Gln in ERCC2 is associated with an increase of lung cancer risk, with a summary OR as 1.15. No association was found for any other polymorphisms. When studies were stratified by ethnicity, the risk effect of Lys751Gln in ERCC2 was found only in Caucasians, not in Asians. In conclusion, Lys751Gln in ERCC2 is associated with lung cancer, and the risk effect probably exists in Caucasians.

To derive a precise estimate for this association, we carried out an updated meta-analysis by pooling data thus far published. The pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) was calculated to assess the role of APE1 Asp148Glu polymorphism in lung carcinogenesis. The pooled ORs suggested that variant genotypes of APE1 Asp148Glu were modestly associated with an elevated risk of lung cancer (GluGlu vs. AspAsp, OR=1.22, 95 % CI 1.01-1.48, P=0.038; GluGlu vs. AspAsp + AspGlu, OR=1.19, 95 % CI 1.02-1.39, P=0.023).

Genotyping was performed using DNA from cervical biopsy specimens collected from 53 patients with cervical adenocarcinoma, of whom 34 were HPV 16 or 18 positive, and from the cervical exfoliated cells from 286 control women, of whom 48 were positive for HPV 16 or 18. For the determination of p53 polymorphisms genomic DNA was examined by PCR amplification of the specific allele assay, and for the determination of p21 polymorphisms DNA was examined by the PCR-RFLP assay using BsmAI. We found significant differences in genotype frequencies of both genes between the two groups (p < 0.001). The p53 genotypes containing the Pro allele were significantly associated with cervical adenocarcinoma with an OR of 2.89 (95% CI 1.54-5.42). Also, homozygous carriers of the p21 Ser allele showed a substantially increased risk of developing cervical adenocarcinoma (OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.13-3.79) compared to genotypes containing the Arg allele. In addition, the combination of the Pro allele containing genotypes of p53 and the Ser homozygous genotype of p21 posed a remarkably increased risk (OR 5.22; 95% CI 2.24-12.16), although the interaction of the two genes could not be found.

Genetic studies revealed that EPAS1 plays a key role in high altitude adaptation and is associated with the low hemoglobin concentration in Tibetans. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs13419896, rs4953354, rs1868092) of noncoding regions in EPAS1 exhibited significantly different allele frequencies in the Tibetan and Han populations and were associated with low hemoglobin concentrations in Tibetans.

Genotyping was performed by high resolution melting curve analysis. The G-G-G haplotype of rs13419896, rs4953354, and rs1868092 was significantly more frequent in HAPC patients than in control subjects, whereas no differences in the allele or genotype frequencies of the 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms were found between HAPC patients and control subjects.

Moreover, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) may provide insight into how variants alter CRC risk and how regulatory elements control gene expression. To investigate the racial and ethnic diversity of CRC-susceptibility genetic variants and their relevance to the Taiwanese population, we genotyped 705 CRC cases and 1,802 healthy controls (Taiwan Biobank) for fifteen previously reported East Asian CRC-susceptibility SNPs and four novel genetic variants identified by whole-exome sequencing. We found that rs10795668 in FLJ3802842 and rs4631962 in CCND2 were significantly associated with CRC risk in the Taiwanese population. The previously unreported rs1338565 was associated with a significant increased risk of CRC. In addition, we also genotyped tumor tissue and paired adjacent normal tissues of these 705 CRC cases to search for LOH, as well as risk-associated and protective alleles. LOH analysis revealed preferential retention of three SNPs, rs12657484, rs3802842, and rs4444235, in tumor tissues. rs4444235 has been recently reported to be a cis-acting regulator of BMP4 gene; in this study, the C allele was preferentially retained in tumor tissues (p\u200a=\u200a0.0023). rs4631962 and rs10795668 contribute to CRC risk in the Taiwanese and East Asian populations, and the newly identified rs1338565 was specifically associated with CRC, supporting the ethnic diversity of CRC-susceptibility SNPs.

{"abstract": "One-carbon metabolism plays an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Meta-analyses have suggested protective associations of folate and vitamin B6 intakes with colorectal cancer primarily based on studies in Caucasians, and genetic polymorphisms pertaining to the folate metabolism have been a matter of interest. Less investigated are the roles of methionine synthase (MTR) and thymidylate synthetase (TS) polymorphisms in colorectal carcinogenesis. In a study of 816 cases and 815 community controls in Japan, we investigated associations of dietary intakes of folate, methionine, vitamin B2, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 with colorectal cancer risk. The associations with MTR 2756A>G, MTRR 66A>G, and TSER repeat polymorphism were examined in 685 cases and 778 controls. Methionine and vitamin B12 intakes were inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk, but the associations were totally confounded by dietary calcium and n-3 fatty acids. The other nutrients showed no association with the risk even without adjustment for calcium and n-3 fatty acids. The TSER 2R allele was dose-dependently associated with an increased risk. The MTR and MTRR polymorphisms were unrelated to colorectal cancer risk. There was no measurable gene-gene or gene-nutrient interaction, but increased risk associated with the TSER 2R allele seemed to be confined to individuals with high folate status. This study does not support protective associations for folate and vitamin B6. The TSER 2R allele may confer an increased risk of colorectal cancer. The role of the TSER polymorphism in colorectal carcinogenesis may differ by ethnicity.

As PCa risk SNPs may also influence disease outcome, we studied here eight 8q24 risk alleles, and evaluated their role in PCa clinical covariates in northern Chinese men. Blood samples and clinical information were collected from ethnically Chinese men from Northern China with histologically-confirmed PCa (n=289) and from age-matched normal controls (n=288). Eight 8q24 SNPs were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction- high-resolution melting analysis in 577 subjects. We examined the prevalence distribution of 8q24 risk alleles and analyzed the associations between the risk allele and PCa and clinical covariates to infer their impact on aggressive PCa. Three of the eight SNPs were associated with PCa risk in northern Chinese men, including rs16901966 (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.01-1.70, p=0.042), rs1447295 (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.09-1.98, p=0.011) and rs10090154 (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.14-2.12, p=0.005).

The purpose of this study was to examine the relation of rs6929846 of BTN2A1 to Type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 8650 Japanese individuals from two independent subject panels were examined: Panel A comprised 1141 individuals with Type 2 diabetes and 3161 control subjects and panel B comprised 1664 individuals with Type 2 diabetes and 2684 control subjects. The chi-square test revealed that rs6929846 of BTN2A1 was significantly related to the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in subject panel A (P = 0.0002) and subject panel B (P=0.006). Multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age, sex, body mass index and smoking status revealed that rs6929846 was significantly associated with Type 2 diabetes (P = 0.0006; odds ratio 1.25) in all individuals, with the T allele representing a risk factor for this condition.

Given the critical role of CYP19 in estrogen synthesis, the potential influence of CYP19 rs4646 polymorphism on breast cancer survival, deserves further study. Genotyping for CYP19 rs4646 variants was performed on 406 Chinese women with stage I-II and operable stage III breast cancer. Associations were evaluated between CYP19 rs4646 genotypes and disease-free survival (DFS). In premenopausal patients, women who are homozygous for the minor allele (AA) have a longer DFS compared with those carrying the major allele (CC or AC) (87 months versus 48.7 months; Hazard ratio (HR) = 0.56, 95 % CI = 0.318-0.985, P = 0.041). These differences were further demonstrated by a multivariate analysis (HR = 0.456, 95 % CI = 0.249-0.836, P = 0.011). Conversely, the same variant (AA) was estimated to be associated with a poorer DFS in postmenopausal women (AA versus AC or CC: 13.7 months versus 56.3 months; HR = 2.758, 95 % CI = 1.432-5.313, P = 0.002). Furthermore, the differences were confirmed by the COX proportional hazards model (HR = 2.983, 95% CI =1.494-5.955, P = 0.002).

{"abstract": "Mouse inbred strains with inherited predisposition and resistance to lung cancer provide an essential tool for the dissection of the genetics of this complex disease. We have previously mapped a major locus (Pulmonary adenoma susceptibility 1, Pas1) affecting inherited predisposition to lung cancer in mice on chromosome 6, near Kras2. Appropriate crosses that include susceptible mice (Pas1(s)) provide a model system for identifying loci that can modify the lung cancer predisposition phenotype caused by Pas1. Using this approach we have mapped the Pulmonary adenoma resistance 1 (Par1) locus that behaves like a modifier locus of Pas1. More recently, we mapped additional lung tumor resistance loci (Par2, and Par4), and a locus specifically involved with lung tumor progression (Papg1). The mapping of Pas1 in mice stimulated us to test the possible association of genetic markers located in the homologous human region (12p12) with risk and prognosis of lung adenocarcinomas in man. In the Italian population, we carried out an association study by genotyping lung adenocarcinoma patients and healthy controls for genetic markers located in the putative region of interest. Homozygosity of the A2 allele at a Kras2/RsaI polymorphism, and allele 2 at a VNTR polymorphism in the PTHLH gene showed borderline statistically significant associations with lung cancer risk. Furthermore, the same alleles were significantly associated with tumor prognosis. Studies on association were then performed in the Japanese and in European populations. In the Japanese population, the KRAS2/RsaI marker was significantly associated with prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma, whereas the European study did not confirm this association.

Based on an analysis of 71 Japanese patients with esophageal squamous cell cancer and 329 healthy control subjects, the distribution of the slow acetylator phenotype was significantly higher in esophageal cancer patients than in the controls (19.7% and 9.4%, respectively, p = 0.040). The odds ratio of esophageal cancer for the slow phenotype was 2.55 (95% CI = 1.15-5.65, p = 0.023) compared with the rapid type. Furthermore, a significant difference between the distribution of acetylator phenotype and the incidence of lymph node metastasis and lymphatic involvement was found based on the clinicopathological features of these cancers.

Qualified articles were retrospective or nested case-control studies of MMP family gene polymorphisms and CAD. A total of 11 polymorphisms from five MMP family genes were meta-analysed. Forty-eight articles encompassing 59 studies fulfilled the predefined criteria. Data were independently extracted from qualified articles by two reviewers using a standardized Excel template and were verified. Any disagreement was adjudicated by discussion and a consensus was reached. Overall significant associations were observed for Glu45Lys in MMP3 gene under both allelic (OR: 1.52; 95% CI 1.3 to 1.76; p<0.001) and dominant (1.37; 1.23 to 1.54; <0.001) models, and for -1562C/T in MMP9 gene under allelic model (1.11; 1.02 to 1.2; 0.012).

This metabolite is then detoxified by aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), a key enzyme in the elimination of acetaldehyde, via further oxidation to acetic acid. The toxic effects of acetaldehyde are well documented and may be partially mediated by genotoxic damage. In the present study, we investigated the effects of alcohol-drinking behavior and genetic polymorphisms in two different genes (ALDH2 and CYP2E1) on the micronuclei (MN) frequency in 248 healthy Japanese men. Genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP analysis. The ALDH2 variant (deficient type) was significantly associated with an increased MN frequency in subjects drinking more than three times/wk, while habitual drinkers with wild-type CYP2E1 also had a significantly increased MN frequency. Furthermore, when the subjects were divided into eight groups according to their drinking frequency and genotypes of ALDH2 and CYP2E1, we found that habitual drinkers with homozygous CYP2E1*1/*1 and heterozygous ALDH2*1/*2 or homozygous ALDH2*2/*2 showed the highest mean MN frequency. In the present study, we found clear associations among ALDH2 and CYP2E1 gene polymorphisms, alcohol-drinking behavior and genotoxic effects in a healthy Japanese population. Therefore, analysis of the polymorphisms of alcohol-metabolizing enzymes may lead to elucidation of the mechanism(s) for individual susceptibilities to the toxicity of ethanol metabolites.", "title": "Gene-environmental interactions between alcohol-drinking behavior and ALDH2 and CYP2E1 polymorphisms and their impact on micronuclei frequency in human lymphocytes.", "pmid": "16126235", "id": "296"},
{"abstract": "Gemcitabine (2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine) is an anticancer drug, which is effective against solid tumours, including non-small-cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. After gemcitabine is transported into cells by equilibrative and concentrative nucleoside transporters, it is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) and further phosphorylated to its active diphosphorylated and triphosphorylated forms. Gemcitabine is rapidly metabolized by cytidine deaminase (CDA) to an inactive metabolite, 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU), which is excreted into the urine. Toxicities of gemcitabine are generally mild, but unpredictable severe toxicities such as myelosuppression and interstitial pneumonia are occasionally encountered. The aim of this study was to determine the factors, including genetic polymorphisms of CDA, DCK and solute carrier family 29A1 (SLC29A1 [hENT1]), that alter the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine in Japanese cancer patients. 250 Japanese cancer patients who received 30-minute intravenous infusions of gemcitabine at 800 or 1000 mg/m2 in the period between September 2002 and July 2004 were recruited for this study. However, four patients were excluded from the final model built in this study because they showed bimodal concentration-time curves. Two patients who experienced gemcitabine-derived life-threatening toxicities in October 2006 and January 2008 were added to this analysis. One of these patients received 30-minute intravenous infusions of gemcitabine at 454 mg/m2 instead of the usual dose (1000 mg/m2). Plasma concentrations of gemcitabine and dFdU were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array/mass spectrometry. In total, 1973 and 1975 plasma concentrations of gemcitabine and dFdU, respectively, were used to build population pharmacokinetic models using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling software (NONMEM version V level 1.1). Two-compartment models fitted well to plasma concentration-time curves for both gemcitabine and dFdU. Major contributing factors for gemcitabine clearance were genetic polymorphisms of CDA, including homozygous CDA*3 [208G>A (Ala70Thr)] (64% decrease), heterozygous *3 (17% decrease) and CDA -31delC (an approximate 7% increase per deletion), which has a strong association with CDA*2 [79A>C (Lys27Gln)], and coadministered S-1, an oral, multicomponent anti-cancer drug mixture consisting of tegafur, gimeracil and oteracil (an approximate 19% increase). The estimated contribution of homozygous CDA*3 to gemcitabine clearance provides an explanation for the life-threatening severe adverse reactions, including grade 4 neutropenia observed in three Japanese patients with homozygous CDA*3. Genetic polymorphisms of DCK and SLC29A1 (hENT1) had no significant correlation with gemcitabine pharmacokinetic parameters. Aging and increased serum creatinine levels correlated with decreased dFdU clearance. A population pharmacokinetic model that included CDA genotypes as a covariate for gemcitabine and dFdU in Japanese cancer patients was successfully constructed. The model confirms the clinical importance of the CDA*3 genotype.", "title": "Population pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine and its metabolite in Japanese cancer patients: impact of genetic polymorphisms.", "pmid": "20608756", "id": "297"},

{"abstract": "Diabetes Mellitus, which affects 366 million people worldwide, is a leading cause of mortality, morbidity, and loss of quality of life. South Asians, comprising 24% of the world's population, suffer a large burden of type 2 diabetes. With intriguing risk phenotypes, unique environmental triggers, and potential genetic predisposition, South Asians offer a valuable resource for investigating the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. Genomics has proven its potential to underpin some of the etiology of type 2 diabetes by identifying a number of susceptibility genes, but such data are scarce and unclear in South Asians. We present a systematic review of studies on the genetic basis of type 2 diabetes or its complications in South Asians published between 1987-2012, and discuss the findings and limitations of the available data. Of the 91 eligible studies meeting our inclusion criteria, a vast majority included Indian populations, followed by a few in those of Pakistani origin, while other South Asian countries were generally under-represented. Though a large number of studies focused on the replication of findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in European populations, a few studies explored new genes and pathways along with GWAS in South Asians and suggested the potential to unravel population- specific susceptibility genes in this population. We find encouraging improvements in study designs, sample sizes and the numbers of genetic variants investigated over the last five years, which reflect the existing capacity and scope for large-scale genetic studies in South Asians.

We studied retrospectively two independent cohorts composed of 526 white (25% BCR) and 320 Asian men (36% BCR) with pathologically organ-confined prostate cancer who had a median follow-up of 88.8 and 30.8 mo after surgery, respectively. Patients were genotyped for 19 haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) in SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 genes, and their prognostic significance on prostate-specific antigen recurrence was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox regression model. After adjusting for all clinicopathologic risk factors, four SNPs (rs2208532, rs12470143, rs523349, and rs4952197) were associated with BCR in both whites and Asians. The strongest effect was conferred by the SRD5A2 V89L nonsynonymous SNP (rs523349C) with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.07-4.00; p = 4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070; 48% BCR). In addition, in whites, the combination of two SNPs, rs518673T in SRD5A1 and rs12470143A in SRD5A2, was associated with a reduced BCR rate for carriers of three or four alleles (HR: 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19-0.71; p=0.003;16% BCR) compared with noncarriers (38% BCR), whereas the SRD5A2 rs12470143A was significant in Asians (HR: 0.46; 95% CI, 0.28-0.73; p=0.001).

{"abstract": "Cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), play an important role in the liver. The aim of this study was to investigate associations between common polymorphisms in potential functional promoters of cytokine genes and liver damage markers among enrollees of a large Japanese cohort study. Subjects included 3257 Japanese individuals (1608 men and 1649 women, aged 35-69 years). Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter regions of five cytokine genes, IL1B (T-31C), IL6 (C-634G), IL8 (T-251A), IL10 (T-819C), tumor necrosis factor-A (TNFA) (T-1031C), and TNFA (C-857T), were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction. Information regarding alcohol intake, smoking habits, height, and weight was collected by a self-administered questionnaire. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured during a routine health check-up. Of the six SNPs genotyped, an IL6 polymorphism (rs1800796, C-634G) was most strongly associated with a liver damage marker, AST. Mean serum AST was significantly different among the three genotypes (mean \u00b1 SD, 22.7 \u00b1 7.3 IU/L for CC, 22.8 \u00b1 7.7 IU/L for CG, and 24.3 \u00b1 8.6 IU/L for GG, p=0.011 by analysis of variance). The differences remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders by general linear models. The variations in mean serum AST and ALT levels were marked especially among men. Thus, the functional polymorphism IL6 C-634G may affect serum AST and ALT levels, possibly through different IL-6 production.", "title": "Associations between polymorphisms of interleukin-6 and related cytokine genes and serum liver damage markers: a cross-sectional study in the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) Study.", "pmid": "25523094", "id": "301"},

{"abstract": "To clarify the role of genetic factors in atherosclerotic plaque formation in the carotid artery and magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities in the brain, we investigated the association of these abnormalities with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genotype. One hundred sixty-nine subjects (age, 59.2+/-0.8 years, mean+/-SE) admitted to our hospital for health checkups underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate lacunar infarction. B-mode ultrasound examinations of the carotid arteries were performed to detect atherosclerotic plaque. The I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene was determined by the polymerase chain reaction method. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to assess the effects of the following variables on the presence of plaque, mean plaque thickness, and number of plaques: fibrinogen, sex, age, body mass index, mean blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, hematocrit, and the D allele of the ACE gene. The frequency of carotid atherosclerotic plaque was significantly (P=.034) higher in subjects with the D allele than in those without this allele. However, the frequency of lacunar stroke was similar in these groups. A multivariate regression analysis showed that the presence of plaque was independently associated with the D allele (odds ratio=3.27, P=.016). However, mean plaque thickness and the number of plaques were not associated with the D allele.

We studied whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) gene contribute to the effect of HRT on lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD). Subjects were 84 post-menopausal women who had been taking HRT for 3 years to treat osteopenia or osteoporosis. Eighteen SNP in the ERalpha gene were characterized by a single nucleotide primer extension assay. Genotyping of the 84 individuals revealed that all SNP were quite common, the minor allele frequency being > or = 20%. A SNP in intron 6 (IVS6+14144) was significantly associated with the response to HRT for the first 3 years after starting treatment (P = 0.043, 0.025 and 0.032 for the first, second and third years respectively).

We investigated whether genetic polymorphisms on the alpha-chain of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRIalpha) gene were associated with the AICU phenotype. We genotyped 2 promoter polymorphisms (-344C>T and -95T>C) of FcepsilonRIalpha gene in the Korean population, and the functional effect of the -344C>T polymorphism was analyzed by using a luciferase reporter assay and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The rare allele frequency of the -344C>T polymorphism was significantly higher in the patients with AICU compared with the other subjects (P= .008 for AICU vs aspirin-tolerant chronic urticaria; P= .03 for AICU vs controls). This polymorphism was also significantly associated with total serum IgE concentrations and a higher rate of atopy in the patients with AICU (P= .01 and .05, respectively). The reporter plasmid that carried the -344T allele exhibited significantly higher promoter activity in a rat mast cell line (RBL-2H3) compared with the promoter activity of the -344C allele (P< .001). We found that transcription factor Myc-associated zinc finger protein preferentially bound the -344C promoter. Moreover, patients with AICU with the heterozygous CT genotype of the -344C>T polymorphism exhibited greater anti-IgE-mediated histamine release compared with those with the homozygous CC genotype. These results suggest that the -344C>T polymorphism of the FcepsilonRIalpha promoter may be associated with increased expression of FcepsilonRIalpha on mast cells and enhanced release of histamine.

We have determined 4 frequent nonsynonymous gene polymorphisms of CYP1B1 in the human tumor cell lines panels of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research (JFCR): rs10012 (R48G), rs1056827 (A119S), rs1056836 (L432V), and rs1800440 (N453S). Numerous anticancer drugs have been tested against these panels that offer the opportunity to detect associations between gene polymorphisms and drug sensitivity. CYP1B1 single nucleotide polymorphisms were in marked linkage disequilibrium. The L432V allelic variants were significantly associated with reduced sensitivity to DNA-interacting anticancer agents, alkylators, camptothecins, topoisomerase II inhibitors, and some antimetabolites.

Among the pregnant women, those that carried MTHFR 677CC (i.e. wild-genotype homozygote) and 1298CC (i.e. mutant-genotype homozygote) exhibited higher BLLs than those that carried 677CT/TT (standardized \u03b2 = 0.074, P = 0.042) and 1298AC/AA (standardized \u03b2 = 0.077, P = 0.035) when other covariates (e.g., age, no. of children, education and income, etc.) were adjusted. The BLLs of pregnant women consistently decreased during the pregnancy and these levels positively correlated with BMI (standard \u03b2 = 0.086-0.096, P<0.05). The 1298CC mutant-type homozygote in the MTHFR gene is a risk factor for high BLLs among low-level environmental lead-exposed Chinese pregnant women, whose BLLs consistently decreased during gestation.", "title": "Association of blood lead levels with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms among Chinese pregnant women in Wuhan city.", "pmid": "25723397", "id": "313"},
{"abstract": "IL-4 gene cluster on chromosome 5 contains several candidate genes for atopy and asthma. Several independent studies have shown evidence for linkage between the markers flanking IL-4 gene cluster and asthma and/or asthma-related traits. Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is located approximately 300 kb telomeric to IL-4 and recent study reveals that IRF-1 deficiency results in an elevated production of Th2-related cytokines and a compensatory decrease in the expression of native cell- and Th1-related cytokines. To determine if there are any mutations associated with the development of atopy and asthma present in the coding exons and 5' flanking region of the IRF-1 gene. We have screened the promoter and coding regions of the IRF-1 gene in atopic asthmatics and controls by SSCP method. We found three novel nuclear variants (the -300G/T and 4396 A/G polymorphisms and the 6355G > A rare variant) in the IRF-1 gene. No variants causing amino acid alterations of IRF-1 were detected. The -300G/T polymorphism was in nearly complete linkage disequilibrium with the 4396 A/G polymorphism. An association between the 4396 A > G polymorphism and atopy/asthma was examined by transmission disequilibrium test in 81 asthmatic families. Either of 4396 A or 4396G alleles was not significantly preferentially transmitted to atopy- or asthma-affected children.

Many of these compounds undergo alpha-hydroxylation by CYP2E1 to form DNA adducts. The gene coding for this enzyme is polymorphic and thus may constitute a susceptibility factor for CRC. We conducted a population-based case-control study in Hawaii to test the association of two functional polymorphisms in CYP2E1 (the G1259C RsaI substitution and a 5' 96-bp insertion variant) with CRC, as well as their modifying effects on the association of RM and processed meat (PM) with this cancer. We obtained interviews and blood samples for 521 patients with CRC (165 with rectal cancer) and 639 controls of Japanese, Caucasian, or Hawaiian origin. Genotyping was performed by PCR. After adjustment for CRC risk factors, subjects with the 5' insert variant were found to be at a 60% increased risk (95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.5) for rectal cancer. Subjects who carry the insert and who were predicted to have been exposed to increased levels of nitrosamines, based on their high intake of RM or PM, were at a markedly greater increased risk (2- and 3-fold for RM and PM, respectively) for rectal cancer. No clear association was found for colon cancer. A similar increase in rectal cancer risk was found for CYP2E1 insert carriers who consumed salted/dried fish or Oriental pickled vegetables.

Recently, whole-genome association studies have identified several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FGFR2 as novel breast cancer susceptibility loci. In the present study of 1049 breast cancer patients and 1073 cancer-free controls, we assessed whether polymorphisms of FGFR2 are associated with breast cancer risk in Chinese women and whether these associations are stronger in women with a reproductive history suggestive of greater exposure to endogenous estrogens. We genotyped three FGFR2 polymorphisms (rs2981582C/T, rs1219648A/G and rs2420946C/T) using the SNPstream 12-plex platform. Each of the three SNPs was significantly associated with increased breast cancer risk in a dose-dependent manner.

In this study we analyze the PCOS phenotype-genotype relationship in silico, using SNPs of representative genes for analysis of genetic clustering and distance, to evaluate the degree of genetic similarity. 1000 Genomes, HapMap, and Human Genome Diversity Project databases were used as source of allele frequencies of the SNPs, using data from male and female individuals grouped according to their geographical ancestry. Genetic clustering was calculated from SNPs data by Bayesian inference. The inferred ancestry of individuals was matched with PCOS phenotype data, extracted from a previous meta-analysis. The measure of genetic distance was plotted against the geographic distance between the populations. The individuals were assigned to five genetic clusters, matching with different world regions (Kruskal-Wallis/Dunn's post test; P < .0001), and converging in two main PCOS phenotypes in different degrees of affinity.

Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Heterogeneity was assessed using the heterogeneity metric (I\u00b2) and Chi-squared test. The glutathione S-transferase M1 null polymorphism was associated with increased risk of low-grade intra-epithelial lesions (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.05-1.77), but no increased risk of high-grade intra-epithelial lesions (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.87-1.8) or invasive cervical cancer (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.99-1.46). The association seemed to be confined to Southeast Asians (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.44-2.71). No significant associations were found for the glutathione S-transferase T1 null polymorphism for any of the populations. The glutathione S-transferase M1 null polymorphism significantly increases susceptibility to early-stage cervical lesions in Southeast Asians. However, the glutathione S-transferase T1 null polymorphism does not appear to be a risk factor for cervical lesions in any population.", "title": "Association of glutathione S-transferase M1 and T1 null polymorphisms with the development of cervical lesions: a meta-analysis.", "pmid": "21962942", "id": "332"},

This study aimed to investigate the associations of SIRT1 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs7895833, rs7069102, and rs2273773, with various laboratory data in 1279 Japanese health checkup examinees. The genotyping was performed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with confronting 2-pair primers (CTPP) assay. Concerning rs7895833 (A allele frequency: 0.290), body fat ratio and body mass index were high in the AA carriers of male subjects, and diastolic blood pressure was high in the AA carriers of female subjects. Concerning rs7069102 (G allele frequency: 0.181), body fat ratio and systolic blood pressure were high in the GG carriers of male subjects. Concerning rs2273773 (C allele frequency: 0.323), fasting glucose and body fat ratio were high in the TT carriers of male subjects, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were high in the CC carriers of male subjects. Thus, the A allele of rs7895833, G allele of rs7069102, and T allele of rs2273773 carried a high risk for obesity in men. Furthermore, the A allele of rs7895833 in women, and the G allele of rs7069102 and C allele of rs2273773 in men, carried a high risk for hypertension. The T allele of rs2273773 in men carried a high risk for hyperglycemia. In conclusion, these SIRT1 gene polymorphisms are associated with high body fat and blood pressure in Japanese, especially in men.

To address these issues, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis using 40 case-control and 13 cohort studies that reported on the risk associated with alcohol drinking for at least three levels of consumption. In studies adjusted for age, sex, and tobacco smoking, the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between light alcohol drinking (\u2264 12.5 g/d) and risk of ESCC was 1.38 (1.14-1.67). The association was slightly stronger in Asian countries than in other populations. The adjusted RRs (95% CIs) were 2.62 (2.07-3.31) for moderate drinking (>12.5-<50 g/d) and 5.54 (3.92-7.28) for high alcohol intake (\u226550 g/d); the RRs were slightly higher in non-Asian populations. In prospective studies, the RR (95% CI) was 1.35 (0.92-1.98) for light, 2.15 (1.55-2.98) for moderate, and 3.35 (2.06-5.46) for high alcohol intakes; light drinking showed an association with ESCC in Asia (five studies) but not in other regions (three studies). Among never-smokers (nine studies), the RR (95% CI) was 0.74 (0.47-1.16) for light, 1.54 (1.09-2.17) for moderate, and 3.09 (1.75-5.46) for high intakes.

{"abstract": "This study was performed to explore the possibility of an association between polymorphisms within the uridine diphosphate  glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 gene (UGT1A1) and hyperbilirubinemia arising during tocilizumab therapy. We examined the distributions of 3 variant alleles, UGT1A1*6, *28, and *27, in 46 Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had received tocilizumab therapy for at least 24\u00a0weeks, grouped the patients according to their carriage status of these UGT1A1 variants, and determined the frequency of hyperbilirubinemia in each of the groups. Of the 46 patients treated with tocilizumab, 34 maintained normal bilirubin levels after 24\u00a0weeks, whereas the remaining 12 developed mild or moderate hyperbilirubinemia. Patients carrying 2 copies of UGT1A1*28 (*28/*28) were more likely to develop hyperbilirubinemia than those without UGT1A1*28. In addition, patients carrying 2 copies of variant alleles, either as homozygotes (UGT1A1*6/*6 or *28/*28) or as compound heterozygotes (UGT1A1*6/*28), were at higher risk of hyperbilirubinemia as compared with those without either UGT1A1*6 or UGT1A1*28 (odds ratio [OR] 28.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.39-336.00; p\u00a0=\u00a00.005). Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed the strong association of tocilizumab-induced hyperbilirubinemia with the presence of 2 copies of variant alleles (OR 25.51; 95% CI 2.35-276.53; p\u00a0=\u00a00.008), yielding an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.78 (95% CI 0.60-0.95, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005). Tocilizumab can induce hyperbilirubinemia in RA patients, especially those carrying UGT1A1*6/*6, *6/*28, and *28/*28 genotypes. Considering this genetic association, it may be unnecessary to withdraw this drug from RA patients in the absence of other signs of hepatic injury. Given that tocilizumab has the potential to inhibit UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation, however, it may inhibit not only bilirubin metabolism but also UGT1A1-dependent detoxification of drugs, thereby increasing the risk of unwanted adverse events during RA therapy.", "title": "Tocilizumab-induced hyperbilirubinemia in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis: its association with UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 gene polymorphisms.", "pmid": "21993917", "id": "352"},

A case-control study was conducted on patients with clinically diagnosed ADHD; the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham, Fourth Revision (SNAP-IV) questionnaire was used to identify normal controls aged 4-15 years. Participants were examined for urinary NP concentrations, blood lead levels, and select single-nucleotide polymorphisms of two dopamine-related genes (D4 dopamine receptor, DRD4, and dopamine transporter, DAT1). Socio-demographic variables, maternal lifestyle factors during pregnancy and family medical history were obtained using a questionnaire.

We further demonstrate that the disease-associated genotype INS +/+ confers susceptibility independently of HLA class II alleles associated with IDDM.

Of the 104 patients, 102 (98.1%) harboured cagA(+) strains and all had vacA s1 genotype. The babA2(+) strains were found in 83 (79.8%) patients and were associated with higher lymphocytic infiltration (p=0.028), presence of glandular atrophy (odds ratio (OR) 7.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-24.3), and intestinal metaplasia (OR 7.4, 95% CI 2.2-25.3) in the antrum. Increased epithelial proliferation was also noted in individuals infected with babA2(+) strains (p=0.025). Strains harbouring cagA(+)/vacA s1 genotypes lacked this association in the absence of babA2.

Plasma ACE activity and carotid-wall thickening measured by ultrasonography were related, and it was postulated that long-term exposure to high levels of plasma ACE could be involved in structural changes of the arterial wall. In addition, angiotensinogen gene mutation was recently reported to be associated with essential hypertension and preeclampsia. There exists a possibility that the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the progress of cardiovascular diseases in humans. Therefore, we examined the association between the molecular variant of the angiotensin gene and coronary atherosclerosis. This study included 82 patients who had coronary atherosclerosis and 160 control subjects; all study participants were Japanese. All patients with coronary atherosclerosis had at least one coronary artery with > 25% luminal diameter obstruction on average according to multiple coronary angiographic views. Angiotensinogen gene molecular variants were designated AA, Aa, and aa. The a allele indicated thymine-cytosine transition at nucleotide 704 in exon 2. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. Polymerase chain reaction was performed to amplify the concerned region of the angiotensinogen gene. After restriction enzyme digestion, it was possible to distinguish the molecular variant of the angiotensinogen gene. The frequencies of these genotypes were 7.3%, 26.8%, and 65.9% in the patients and 18.8%, 31.9%, and 49.3% in the control subjects for the AA, Aa, and aa alleles, respectively. There was an excess in the a allele among patients (P < .01). We found a significant association between coronary atherosclerosis and a molecular variant of the angiotensin gene.

Study subjects were 583 histologically diagnosed gastric cancer patients and age- and sex-matched 1592 control outpatients, who visited Aichi Cancer Center Hospital from 2001 to 2005. Serum anti-H. pylori IgG antibody and pepsinogens were measured to evaluate H. pylori infection and gastric atrophy, respectively. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by a logistic model. Among the seropositive subjects, the age- and sex-adjusted OR of gastric atrophy was 1.17 (95%CI: 0.91-1.50) for G/C, 1.20 (95%CI: 0.76-1.89) for C/C, and 1.18 (95%CI: 0.93-1.49) for G/C+C/C relative to G/G genotype.

These play a key role in epilepsy, with the most commonly mutated gene in epilepsy being SCN1A. We examined whether polymorphisms in the above genes affect epilepsy risk in 1,529 epilepsy patients and 1,935 controls from four ethnicities or locations: Malay, Indian, and Chinese, all from Malaysia, and Chinese from Hong Kong. Of patients, 19\u00a0% were idiopathic, 42\u00a0% symptomatic, and 40\u00a0% cryptogenic. We genotyped 43 polymorphisms: 27 in Hong Kong, 28 in Malaysia, and 12 in both locations.

The adjusted odds ratio of gastric atrophy for low folate level (< or = 4 mg/ml) was 0.21 (95% confidence interval = 0.05-0.78). The associations of tHcy with serum folate and MTHFR genotype were clearly observed in this dataset. The present study demonstrated that folate and MTHFR genotype were the deterministic factors of plasma tHcy, but not H. pylori infection and subsequent gastric atrophy, indicating that even if H. pylori infection influences the risk of atherosclerosis, the influence may not be through the elevation of homocysteine.", "title": "No associations of Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric atrophy with plasma total homocysteine in Japanese.", "pmid": "17396161", "id": "386"},
{"abstract": "A male patient, who was born with congenital cutis laxa characterized by cutaneous laxity due to the degeneration of elastic fibers, presented with an arrest of mental and motor development at the age of 3 years. The progressive decline of the psychomotor abilities led to the patient's death at the age of 4 years and 9 months. An autopsy revealed extensive white matter degeneration, characterized by the formation of numerous neuroaxonal spheroids and a diffuse loss of axons and myelin sheaths. The centrum semiovale and the cerebellar white matter were the most severely affected. The ultrastructure of the spheroids was consistent with a dystrophic type of axonal swelling. Neurons of the cerebral cortex, cerebellar cortex, and some brain stem nuclei were lost in moderate to severe degrees, and there were relatively few neuroaxonal spheroids in the gray matter. The pallidum and substantia nigra were well preserved. Neuroaxonal leukodystrophy, in which the spheroid formation predominantly affects the white matter, is the rarest variant of primary neuroaxonal dystrophies, and there are very few reports of autopsied cases. Among the reported cases, two Japanese siblings had congenital skin lesions similar to those of our case.

{"abstract": "With dense single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) maps for 199 drug-related genes, we examined associations between 4190 SNPs and 38 commonly measured quantitative traits using data from 752 healthy Japanese subjects. On analysis, we observed a strong association between five SNPs within the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) gene and serum total bilirubin levels (minimum P-value in Mann-Whitney test=1.82 x 10(10)). UGT1A1 catalyzes the conjugation of bilirubin with glucuronic acid, thus enhancing bilirubin elimination. This enzyme is known to play an important role in the variation of serum bilirubin levels. The five SNPs, including a nonsynonymous SNP-rs4148323 (211G>A or G71R variant allele known as UGT1A1*6)-showed strong linkage disequilibrium with each other. No other genes were clearly associated with serum total bilirubin levels. Results of linear multiple regression analysis on serum total bilirubin levels followed by analysis of variance showed that at least 13% of the variance in serum total bilirubin levels could be explained by three haplotype-tagging SNPs in the UGT1A1 gene.", "title": "Association study between single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 199 drug-related genes and commonly measured quantitative traits of 752 healthy Japanese subjects.", "pmid": "19343046", "id": "388"},
{"abstract": "Association studies using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have the potential to help unravel the genetic basis of hypertension. Nevertheless, to date, association studies of hypertension have yielded ambiguous results. It is becoming clear that such association studies must be interpreted within the context of the genetic structure of the populations being studied, and patterns of variation within specific genomic regions. With this in mind we analyzed genetic variation in the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 4 (GRK4) gene, a gene whose product has recently been shown to inhibit the dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1) from increasing sodium excretion. We genotyped three previously identified GRK4 SNPs, as well as ten additional SNPs, over 71.6 kb of the GRK4 locus in four populations: African Americans, Asians, Hispanics and Caucasians. Haplotype structure varied among populations, with Hispanics and Caucasians having the most linkage disequilibrium (LD) among SNPs. African Americans had three shorter haplotype blocks, while patterns of markers in the Asian populations demonstrated less LD among markers, a pattern inconsistent with block structure. We observed limited haplotype diversity in each of the four populations, with differing haplotype frequencies among the ethnic groups. We also found substantial evidence for population differentiation, with the largest differences between the African-American and Asian samples with F(ST) values in the upper 90(th) percentile when compared to a genome-wide distribution. However, for all population comparisons, F(ST) values decreased sharply in the 3' region of the gene. This pattern of differentiation among populations is consistent with selection in this part of the gene maintaining similar patterns of variation among otherwise divergent populations. Our results document not only different allele frequencies between populations, but differences in haplotype structure that may be important in evaluating association studies between hypertension and GRK4.", "title": "Patterns of genetic variation in the hypertension candidate gene GRK4: ethnic variation and haplotype structure.", "pmid": "16441255", "id": "389"},

Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) produced by T lymphocytes and natural killer cells plays an essential role in affecting cellular immune responses. A functional study demonstrated that two single nucleotide polymorphisms located in the IFN-gamma gene intron (at positions +874 and +2109) were involved in its transcriptional regulation. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether IFN-gamma gene polymorphisms or its haplotypes might be associated with predisposition to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the Chinese population. The study included 181 cases with HBV infection and 272 gender, age-matched healthy controls. All genotyping were identified by polymerase chain reaction in association with the measurement of amplification refractory mutation system. A significant difference was observed between case and control groups. The frequency of +874A allele was significantly higher in patients than in controls (OR = 2.25, 95%CI = 1.69-2.99, P < 0.0001). However, no significant difference was found in the allelic frequencies of IFN-gamma +2109A/G between cases and controls (P > 0.05). By haplotype analysis, the frequency of haplotype AG (+874A and +2109G) revealed a significant difference in the cases in comparison to controls (P < 0.0001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that individuals possessing haplotype AG had an increased likelihood of HBV infection (OR = 8.14, 95%CI = 4.98-13.30).

Accordingly, mitochondrial functional differences are thought to be one of the most important factors for the risk of myocardial infarction among various individuals.

The study population comprised 2,137 unrelated Japanese individuals, including 1,181 subjects with a first myocardial infarction (920 males, 261 females) and the control subjects (522 males, 434 females). Twenty-eight mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms of 12 major mitochondrial haplogroups (A, B, D4, D5, F, G1, G2, M7a, M7b, M7c, N9a, and N9b) were determined by use of 28-plex PCR and fluorescent beads combined with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes. After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and prevalence of smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes, a significantly (P = 0.0019) lower prevalence of haplogroup N9b was detected in subjects with myocardial infarction than in the controls. Especially, the prevalence of this haplogroup was significantly lower (P = 0.0007) in the male subjects with the disease than in the male controls. In contrast, there were trends towards higher prevalence of the disease in haplogroup G1 for males (P < 0.05). No significant haplogroup-related associations were detected for females.

Recent studies suggested that histone deacetylases (HDACs) might increase the expression of several key genes in the brain and may also be associated with susceptibility to SCZ. Among human HDACs, HDAC2 is a critical modulator of gene regulation. Here, we designed a two-stage case-control study to thoroughly examine the association between the HDAC2 gene and SCZ. A total of 19 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the region of the HDAC2 gene were analyzed in the test group of 1430 patients and 2862 matched healthy controls. A comparison of the genotype and allele frequencies of the SNPs between cases and controls revealed that three SNPs, rs13212283, rs6568819 and rs9488289, were nominally associated with SCZ. However, we failed to observe any association between these SNPs and SCZ in the validation group consisting of 896 cases and 1815 matched healthy controls. Furthermore, haplotypic analysis also confirmed the negative results. Our results provide preliminary evidence that HDAC2 may not confer susceptibility to SCZ in Han Chinese.

We investigated the effect of rs187238 and rs1946518 in IL-18 gene and rs8099917 in IL-28B gene on HBV recurrence in liver transplant patients. A total of 200 liver transplant recipients and relevant donors were enrolled in this study. The patients' mean follow-up was 39 month (range 10-65 month). All liver transplant recipients were in a stable stage. The total recipients (n = 200) were divided into end-stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis B (n = 140) and end-stage liver disease secondary to other diseases (n = 60) before transplantation.

Among those primary studies, 22 studies were for Europeans, and one study focused on the MTR A2756G polymorphism in Asians. The results of combined analyses of the MTR A2756G polymorphism suggested that the G allele was associated with increased risk of CHD and myocardial infarction (MI) especially for Europeans (GG vs. AA for CHD: OR [95% CI]=1.63 [1.18-2.25], p(z)(-test)=0.001, p(heterogeneity)=0.274; GG+AG vs. AA for MI: OR [95% CI]=1.44 [1.08-1.93], p(z)(-test)=0.014, p(heterogeneity)=0.611).

To identify additional, non-HLA susceptibility genes, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using Japanese samples.

CCR1 and CCR3 mRNA levels were significantly lower in patients than in healthy controls, and CCR1 mRNA levels were associated with rs3181077 genotypes. In vitro chemotaxis assays were also performed to measure monocyte migration. We observed that monocytes from carriers of the rs3181077 risk allele had lower migration indices with a CCR1 ligand.

The genotype distribution and T allele frequency of G1704T (9.9%) and S allele frequency of G82S (14.2%) in the microalbuminuria group did not significantly differ from those (T allele frequency, 8.4%; S allele frequency, 12.3%) in the normoalbuminuria group. There were no differences among the genotypes of G1704T and G82S of the RAGE gene regarding age, duration of diabetes, body mass index, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure, and serum lipid levels.

FCRL3 SNP -169T/C was genotyped in 573 patients with SLE, 670 patients with RA, and 758 controls. Genotype distributions and allele frequencies were compared among the 3 groups as aggregates or as stratified by clinical characteristics, autoantibody profile, and sex within patient groups. Overall, FCRL3 SNP -169T/C was not associated with susceptibility to either SLE or RA.

A genetic polymorphism coding for a valine to isoleucine substitution in exon 7 has been associated with lung cancer risk in Japanese populations. In a previous study, we found no association between CYP1A1 genotype and breast cancer risk. However, we were interested in determining whether genotype would relate to risk when PCB body burden was taken into account. In a subset of a case-control study in western New York, 154 postmenopausal women with incident, primary, histologically confirmed postmenopausal breast cancer and 192 community controls were interviewed and underwent phlebotomy. Serum levels of 56 PCB peaks were determined by high resolution gas chromatography with electron capture. PCR-RFLP analyses of the CYP1A1 polymorphism were performed. Unconditional logistic regression was used to compute adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Among women with serum PCB levels above the median of the distribution in the control group, there was increased risk of breast cancer associated with the presence of at least one valine allele, compared with women who were homozygous for the isoleucine alleles (odds ratio, 2.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-7.36). Among women with low PCB body burden, no association between CYP1A1 genotype and breast cancer risk was observed. Adjustment for serum lipids and body mass index did not affect the magnitude of the observed associations. PCB body burden may modify the effect of the polymorphism on postmenopausal breast cancer risk through increased CYP1A1 enzyme induction or by activation by specific PCB congeners.

A total of 277 patients and 241 normal subjects were recruited for the study. Mitochondrial nt 3116 - 3353, which spans the 16S rRNA, tRNA(leu(UUR)) and the NADH dehydrogenase 1 gene, were detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct DNA sequencing, PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and allele-specific PCR. Variants were analyzed by two-tailed Fisher exact test. The function of the variants in 16S rRNA were predicted for minimal free energy secondary structures by RNA folding software mfold version 3. Four homoplasmic nucleotide substitutions were observed, 3200T-->C, 3206C-->T, 3290T-->C and 3316G-->A. Only the 3200T-->C mutation is present in the diabetic population and absent in the control population. No statistically significant associations were found between the other three variants and type 2 diabetes. The 3200T-->C and 3206C-->T nucleotide substitutions located in 16S rRNA are novel variants. The 3200T-->C caused a great alteration in the minimal free energy secondary structure model while the 3206C-->T altered normal 16S rRNA structure little.

A GWAS of hypertension-related phenotypes in a Japanese population was conducted in the current study. A total of 936 participants were recruited from the Suita Study and a GWAS with 538,732 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) was performed. The phenotypes included were systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration and alcohol consumption (AC). The SNP exceeding the genome-wide significance level were subjected to subsequent association studies using samples available from the Suita Study and Nomura Study. There is no master gene in the Japanese population that profoundly affects SBP, DBP, BMI, WHR, PRA and PAC. AC was influenced by the functional polymorphism in ALDH2, which affected BP levels in men. The BNP concentration was influenced by a polymorphism in the 3' region of the gene encoding for BNP. However, this polymorphism did not influence blood pressure (BP). Six SNP were identified to be associated with hypertension in both the Suita and Nomura studies.

Classic narcolepsy markers DQB1*06:02 and low CSF hypocretin-1 were found in 87.4% of cases with cataplexy, and in 20.0% without cataplexy. Nine cases (all with cataplexy) were DQB1*06:02 negative with low CSF hypocretin-1, constituting 1.7% [0.8%-3.4%] of all cases with cataplexy and 1.8% [0.8%-3.4%] of cases with low CSF hypocretin independent of cataplexy across sites.

Genetic polymorphisms of cytokine-encoding genes are known to predispose to malignant disease. We hypothesized that the risk of OPCLs might be associated with cytokine gene polymorphisms of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10.

Among women aged less than 50 years, circulating IGF-1 serum levels were significantly lower for those with CC genotype for IGF-1 rs1520220 than levels for those with the GC or GG genotypes (in recessive model: P = 0.007).In gene-diet analyses among these women, we found carrying CC genotype for IGF-1 rs1520220 and high soy isoflavone intake tend to be associated with lower circulating IGF-1 levels synthetically (P = 0.002). Women with GG or GC genotypes for IGF-1 rs1520220 and with low intake of soy isoflavones had the highest levels of circulating IGF-1 (geometric mean [95% CI]: 195 [37, 1021] \u00b5g/L). Comparatively, women with both the CC genotype and high soy intake had the lowest levels of circulating IGF-1 (geometric mean [95% CI]: 120 [38,378] \u00b5g/L). IGF-1 serum levels are significantly lower among women with the CC genotype for IGF-1-rs1520220.

{"abstract": "The Inuit (Eskimo) gene pool is in many respects similar to that of East Asian populations. Some polymorphisms imply frequent occurrence of disorders comparatively rare in Western Europe (e.g. lactose and sucrose malabsorptions). Low frequencies of alleles for slow isoniazid acetylation and sparteine/debrisoquine oxidation indicate slow elimination of a multitude of drugs. Autoimmune disorders (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Graves' disease and psoriasis) are rare, possibly explained by the associations of these disorders with HLA-alleles rare in the Inuit (e.g. HLA-B8). A correspondingly high incidence of reactive arthritis may be explained by a frequent HLA-B27 allele. The prevalence of disorders due to instability of mesenchymal tissues (e.g. spondylolisthesis, osteoarthrosis, hernia, heart block) still requires a biochemical explanation.

{"abstract": "A compelling genetic association with osteoarthritis (OA) of 2 functional alleles in the aspartic acid (D) repeat of the asporin gene was recently reported in a Japanese population. Allele D13 of the repeat encoded OA protection, whereas allele D14 encoded OA susceptibility. The 2 alleles mediate differences in the capacity of asporin to inhibit the cartilage growth factor transforming growth factor beta, with the D14 allele being a particularly potent inhibitor. Our objective was to assess whether the D repeat is associated with OA in UK Caucasians. The repeat was genotyped in 1,247 patients who had undergone elective joint replacement of the hip or the knee due to end-stage primary OA and in 748 age-matched controls. The D13 allele was more common in controls, and the D14 allele was more common in patients. However, this trend was significant only for men who had undergone hip replacement (P = 0.016, odds ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.09-2.01). Our data suggest that the asporin polymorphism is not a major influence on OA etiology in Caucasians. The results of our study do not question the veracity of the Japanese report.

This study aimed to evaluate the associations of CYP2C9 genetic polymorphism with the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin in Chinese patients with hyperlipidemia. A total of 218 patients with hyperlipidemia were selected and treated with 10 mg rosuvastatin per day for 12 weeks. Blood samples were collected prior to the treatment and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. Clinical biochemistry analyses for serum lipid profiles were performed. Genotyping for CYP2C9 polymorphisms was performed using allele-specific real-time PCR. 197 out of 218 patients featured a wild-type CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype, and 21 patients featured a CYP2C9*1/*3 or CYP2C9*3/*3 mutation genotype. No patients with CYP2C9*2 alleles were identified. Sixteen patients discontinued the medication due to adverse effects. No serious adverse events (i.e., hepatotoxicity or myolysis) were observed. After the 12 weeks of treatment, we observed significant reductions in total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels compared to baseline (p < 0.05).

DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1) is a major enzyme that determines genomic methylation patterns and both maintains methyltransferase and exhibits de novo DNA methylation activity in vivo. In order to clarify the association of DNMT1 polymorphisms with SLE, we scrutinized the genetic polymorphisms in exons and their boundaries of DNMT1, including the -1,500 bp promoter region, by direct sequencing in 24 Korean individuals. Twenty-nine sequence variants were identified: two in 5'UTR, six in exons, and 21 in introns. Eight of these polymorphisms were selected for a larger-scale genotyping (n=680) by considering their allele frequencies, haplotype-tagging status, and linkage disequilibrium coefficiencies (LDs) among polymorphisms. The associations between DNMT1 polymorphisms and the clinical profiles of SLE were analyzed. No significant associations with the risk of SLE were detected. However, further analyses of association with autoantibody production among SLE patients revealed that one nonsynonymous SNP, +14463G>C (V120L) in exon 4, was weakly associated with an increased risk of anti-La antibody production (P=0.04), although the significance could not be retained after correction of multiple tests.

In addition, we performed stratified analyses to evaluate ethnicity-specific and age-specific effects. Our subgroup analyses based on ethnicity and age-of-onset confirmed the role of the ORMDL3 rs7216389 polymorphism in conferring susceptibility to both childhood- and adult-onset asthma, especially in Caucasians and Asians. The results of this meta-analysis firmly established that genetic variation at the rs7216389 locus, which controls the expression of the ORMDL3, may be a major, independent predisposing factor for asthma in ethnically diverse populations.

Till now genetic associations of two SNP in exon 2 (+45T/G) and intron 2 (+276G/T) of adiponectin gene with type 2 diabetes and adiponectin level were reported in Japanese population and with insulin resistance in some Caucasian populations (Italy, Germany).

Two polymorphisms, CYP1A2*1C and CYP1A2*1F, were genotyped in 126 patients receiving oral slow-release theophylline (TP) therapy and in 224 healthy volunteers. The CYP1A2 phenotype was assessed by the plasma [1-methyluric acid (1U)+3-methylxanthine (3X)]/TP ratio in the patients. The volunteers were given 150 mg caffeine, and the urine [1X+1U+5-acetylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil (AAMU)]/17U ratio was used for CYP1A2 phenotyping. CYP1A2 intron 1 and six exons (exon 2-exon 7) were sequenced in the patients whose (1U+3X)/TP ratios were below the mean-2SD of those of all patients, and intron 1 was also sequenced in an additional 20 healthy volunteers exhibiting putative low CYP1A2 activities. The individual (1U+3X)/TP ratios ranged from 0.007 to 0.21 (a 30-fold difference) in the patients, and the (1X+1U+AAMU)/17U ratios ranged from 1.6 to 112 (a 70-fold difference) in the healthy volunteers. The CYP1A2 activities were not significantly influenced by CYP1A2*1C or CYP1A2*1F. We found no functional polymorphisms by a sequencing analysis. These results suggest that the CYP1A2*1C and CYP1A2*1F genotypes are not crucial factors for the variability of CYP1A2 activity and that the CYP1A2*1K haplotype is either nil or only shows a very low frequency in Japanese.", "title": "Phenotype-genotype analysis of CYP1A2 in Japanese patients receiving oral theophylline therapy.", "pmid": "16385402", "id": "440"},

Because findings for CRC and adenoma were similar, we combined both groups in the analyses. We confirmed the associations with an increased risk of CRC/adenoma for the 8q24, 11q23 and 15q13 loci in European Americans, and observed significant associations between the 8q24 and 20p12 loci with CRC/adenoma risk in African Americans. Moreover, we found statistically significant cumulative effects of risk alleles on CRC/adenoma risk in all populations (odds ratio [OR] per allele = 1.07-1.09, P \u2264 0.039) except in Japanese Americans (OR = 1.01, P = 0.52). We found heterogeneity in the associations by tumor subsite, age of CRC/adenoma onset, sex, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status for some of the variants. These results provide evidence that the known variants are in aggregate significantly associated with CRC/adenoma risk in multiple populations except Japanese Americans, and the influences may differ across groups defined by clinicopathological characteristics for some variants.

The PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, and Web of Science were searched up to June 2, 2014 for studies on the association of IKZF1 polymorphisms with childhood AL risk. Data were extracted and the odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated by a fixed-effects or random-effects model. Subgroup analysis by ethnicity and leukemia subtype, sensitivity and cumulative meta-analyses were performed. Moreover, publication bias was assessed by Begg's and Egger's tests. In total, 33 case control studies were finally included in this meta-analysis. For rs4132601 polymorphism, significantly increased AL risk was observed in all genetic models (the association was still significant when the p value was Bonferroni adjusted to 0.025). In the subgroup analysis by tumor type, statistical association was observed in B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL). Additionally, when stratified by ethnicity, significantly increased AL risk was only observed in European subgroup, but not among African or mixed population subgroups. Finally, similar results were found for rs11978267 polymorphism. In summary, this meta-analysis provides evidence that rs4132601 and rs11978267 polymorphisms in the IKZF1 gene might contribute to the occurrence of BCP-ALL, especially in European populations.

Multiple obesity loci have been identified using genome-wide association studies mainly in European populations. The aims of this study were to examine the associations of these loci with obesity and gene\u00d7dietary behavior interactions among Chinese children and adolescents. Nineteen candidate SNPs were genotyped using Sequenom technology in the Chinese children (N=2977, 853 obese and 2124 controls, aged 7-17). Dietary behaviors were assessed using self-administered questionnaires. After adjusting for age, sex and multiple testing, MC4R rs17782313, SEC16B rs543874, MAP2K5 rs2241423 and KCTD15 rs11084753 were associated with obesity and obesity-related traits (all P<0.005), with odd ratios ranging from 1.22 to 2.15. Dose-response association was significant between genetic risk score, which was calculated by summing the risk alleles, and the risk of obesity (P<0.001). Multiplicative interaction was found between rs543874 and salt preference on obesity with an OR of 4.40 (95% CI, 1.12-17.30).

Serologic HLA typing showed a remarkably significant increase of HLA-B51 and a significant decrease of HLA-DQw1 in the patients with BD, especially those with ocular lesions including complete type, as compared with the control group (for B51, chi-squared = 46.75, P corrected < 0.001, relative risk [RR] = 7.9; for DQw1, chi-squared = 12.10, P corrected < 0.01, RR = 0.4). By PCR-RFLP genotyping, no significant difference was revealed in any class II alleles between the patient and the control groups in the corrected P value test, but P value analysis showed the significantly high frequency of DRB1*0802 and the significantly low frequencies of DQA1*0103, DQB1*0601, and DQB1*0501. No significant difference was observed in any DPB1 alleles by either P value analysis. These results indicated that the primary and primordial gene(s) responsible for the susceptibility to BD, especially related to ocular lesions, were not located in the HLA class II gene region but were in or very close to the HLA-B locus in the class I region.

The allele type of -2518 polymorphism was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism of Pvu II. The level of MCP-1 in serum and culture supernatent was measured by sandwich ELISA. The average serum level of MCP-1 in Behcet patients was 2.37 times higher than in normal controls. The serum MCP-1 concentration was higher in G-allele carriers than in AA homozygotes, and symptoms accompanying graver cases of Behcet's disease, such as gastrointestinal inflammation and uveitis, were more frequent in patients with the G-allele. However, the frequency of G-allele in patient group was not higher than that in healthy Koreans, probably due to the dominance of G-allele in general Korean population. When stimulated in vitro with IL-1beta and LPS, the mononuclear cells from patients carrying the G-allele showed a steeper increase in MCP-1 production than the boost observed in AA homozygotes. Although the allele frequency of MCP-1 promoter -2518 polymorphism is not likely to be the reason for the elevated serum MCP-1 level in Korean patients with Behcet's disease, it is possible that proinflammatory factors induced in patients' serum cause stronger activation of MCP-1 expression from the G-type promoter, as well as increased incidence of uveitis and gastric ulcer, among carriers of the G-allele.", "title": "The MCP-1 promoter -2518 polymorphism in Behcet's disease: correlation between allele types, MCP-1 production and clinical symptoms among Korean patients.", "pmid": "15115316", "id": "466"},

Significant differences in genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies of PRNP 1368 polymorphism were not observed between AD and normal controls. There were no significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of the PRNP 1368 polymorphism between Korean VaD patients and normal controls.

The CC genotype of the CDKAL1 variant was associated with elevated glycosylated hemoglobin A\u2081(c) (HbA1c) levels. The prevalence of MetS was 25.6% for CC and 16.3% for TT + CT (odds ratio = 2.18, 95% confidence interval: 1.06, 4.48; P = 0.035). When dietary energy intake was accounted for, the variant's effect on HbA1c was observed in the highest energy-intake group (mean: CC, 5.6% (standard deviation, 1.7); TT + CT, 5.0% (standard deviation, 0.5); P = 0.025). In addition, the positive association between HbA1c and energy intake was stronger in subjects with the CC genotype than in subjects with TT + CT.

Insulin has important effects on the regulation of the Abeta level in the brain, modulating both Abeta production and clearance. An optimal brain insulin level promotes Abeta clearance, which may play protective roles against AD. A functional human leptin receptor gene (LEPR) polymorphism, a glutamine to an arginine substitution at codon 223 (Gln223Arg), has been associated with insulin resistance capacity and an altered leptin-binding activity.

No significant association was found between any haplotype and paranoid schizophrenia. The present studies showed that lncRNA MIAT was a novel susceptibility gene for paranoid schizophrenia in the Chinese Han population.

{"abstract": "The human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1) epidemic in Chongqing, China, is increasing rapidly with the dominant subtype of CRF07_BC over the past 3 years. Since human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms have shown strong association with susceptibility/resistance to HIV-1 infection from individuals with different ethnic backgrounds, a recent investigation on frequencies of HLA class I and class II alleles in a Chinese cohort also indicated that similar correlation existed in HIV infected individuals from several provinces in China, however, such information is unavailable in Chongqing, southwest China. In this population-based study, we performed polymerase chain reaction analysis with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (PCR-SSOP) for intermediate-low-resolution HLA typing in a cohort of 549 HIV-1 infected individuals, another 2475 healthy subjects from the Han nationality in Chongqing, China, were selected as population control. We compared frequencies of HLA-A, B, DRB1 alleles, haplotypes and genotypes between the two groups, and analyzed their association with HIV-1 susceptibility or resistance. The genetic profile of HLA (A, B, DRB1) alleles of HIV-1 infected individuals from Chongqing Han of China was obtained. Several alleles of HLA-B such as B*46 (P = 0.001, OR = 1.38, 95%CI = 1.13-1.68), B*1501G(B62) (P = 0.013, OR = 1.42, 95%CI = 1.08-1.88), B*67 (P = 0.022, OR = 2.76, 95%CI = 1.16-6.57), B*37 (P = 0.014, OR = 1.93, 95%CI = 1.14-3.28) and B*52 (P = 0.038, OR = 1.64, 95%CI = 1.03-2.61) were observed to have association with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection in this population. In addition, the haplotype analysis revealed that A*11-B*46, A*24-B*54 and A*01-B*37 for 2-locus, and A*11-B*46-DRB1*09, A*02-B*46-DRB1*08, A*11-B*4001G-DRB1*15, A*02-B*4001G-DRB1*04, A*11-B*46-DRB1*08 and A*02-B*4001G-DRB1*12 for 3-locus had significantly overrepresented in HIV-1 infected individuals, whereas A*11-B*1502G, A*11-B*1502G-DRB1*12 and A*33-B*58-DRB1*13 were underrepresented. However, the low-resolution homozygosity of HLA-A, B, DRB1 loci and HLA-Bw4/Bw6 genotypes did not differ significantly between the two groups. These results may contribute to the database of HLA profiles in HIV-1 infected Chinese population, consequently, the association of certain HLA alleles with susceptibility or resistance to HIV-1 infection would provide with clues in choosing proper preventive strategies against HIV-1 infection and developing effective HIV-1 vaccines in Chinese population, especially for those in southwest China.", "title": "Association of HLA-A, B, DRB1 alleles and haplotypes with HIV-1 infection in Chongqing, China.", "pmid": "20003377", "id": "478"},

Subjects with inactive ALDH2 *2 allele(s) showed a lower level of alcohol consumption than ALDH2 *1/*1 homozygotes (P < 0.001). Among the ALDH2 *1/*2 carriers (n = 243), current/ex-drinkers had a significantly increased risk for gastric cancer compared with never/rare drinkers (OR 2.80, 95% CI 1.51-5.19).

{"abstract": "The linked fetal globin genes (the G gamma- and A gamma-globin genes) were cloned from Japanese individuals with three different haplotypes of the HindIII polymorphisms within the gamma-globin genes. Determination of nucleotide sequences of the segment spanning from IVS2 to the 3' flanking region of each gamma-globin gene revealed that nucleotide differences are located at 43 positions and a stretch of simple GT or GC sequences. Almost half of the nucleotide changes could be accounted for by gene conversion between the G gamma- and A gamma-globin genes. We found that gene conversion had created the SacI polymorphic site just downstream of the A gamma-globin coding region. Association of the SacI polymorphic site with the HindIII polymorphic site suggests that the region containing these two sites was derived from that of the linked G gamma-globin gene through a gene conversion event. The nucleotide sequences obtained here are identical to those of the Caucasoid fetal globin genes of the same haplotypes, with the exception of some sequence changes in the hot spots of mutations. These results indicate that the sequence heterogeneity of the gamma-globin genes can be classified into three major categories according to HindIII haplotypes.

Although the serum IgE level, a useful endophenotype, is generally increased in patients with asthma, genetic factors influencing IgE regulation in asthma are still not fully understood. To identify the genetic variations associated with total serum and mite-specific IgEs in asthmatics, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 657,366 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed in 877 Korean asthmatics. This study found that several new genes might be associated with total IgE in asthmatics, such as CRIM1 (rs848512, P\u200a=\u200a1.18\u00d710(-6); rs711254, P\u200a=\u200a6.73\u00d710(-6)), ZNF71 (rs10404342, P\u200a=\u200a7.60\u00d710(-6)), TLN1 (rs4879926, P\u200a=\u200a7.74\u00d710(-6)), and SYNPO2 (rs1472066, P\u200a=\u200a8.36\u00d710(-6); rs1038770, P\u200a=\u200a8.66\u00d710(-6)).

In further pathway analysis, the phosphatidylinositol signaling system and adherens junction pathways were estimated to play a role in the regulation of total IgE levels in asthma. Although functional evaluations and replications of these results in other populations are needed, this GWAS of serum IgE in asthmatics could facilitate improved understanding of the role of the newly identified genetic variants in asthma and its related phenotypes.

The interaction between killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) regulates the activation of natural killer (NK) cells and certain T cell subsets in response to inflammation. The objective of this study was to explore whether KIR gene and HLA-C allele polymorphisms were associated with DED in a Chinese Han population. Polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers method was used to genotype KIR genes and HLA-C alleles in 106 DED patients and 220 healthy controls. Framework genes KIR2DL4, KIR3DL2, KIR3DL3, and KIR3DP1 were present in all individuals. There were no significant differences in the frequencies of inhibitory KIR genes between the two groups. However, the frequency of KIR2DS2 was significantly higher in severe DED patients than that in healthy controls (p=0.031, odds ratio [OR]=1.828, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.05-3.17). Significantly different distributions of HLA-C allele groups were not observed in severe DED patients and controls. The frequency of the combination of HLA-C1 allele group with KIR2DS2 was significantly higher in severe DED patients compared with controls (p=0.013, OR=2.083, 95% CI=1.16-3.74).

The etiology of PCa is largely unknown but is thought to be multifactorial, where inherited genetics plays an important role. In this article, we first briefly review results from studies of familial aggregation and genetic susceptibility to PCa. We then recap key findings of rare and high-penetrance PCa susceptibility genes from linkage studies in PCa families. We devote a significant portion of this article to summarizing discoveries of common and low-penetrance PCa risk-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genetic association studies in PCa cases and controls, especially those from genome-wide association studies (GWASs). A strong focus of this article is to review the literature on the potential clinical utility of these implicated genetic markers. Most of these published studies described PCa risk estimation using a genetic score derived from multiple risk-associated SNPs and its utility in determining the need for prostate biopsy. Finally, we comment on the newly proposed concept of genetic score; the notion is to treat it as a marker for genetic predisposition, similar to family history, rather than a diagnostic marker to discriminate PCa patients from non-cancer patients. Available evidence to date suggests that genetic score is an objective and better measurement of inherited risk of PCa than family history.

When the patients were grouped according to contact sports, judo players formed the largest group, followed by wrestlers. When grouped according to age, high school students formed the largest group, but the endemic had also expanded among junior high school students and adults, and there was one nursery school child who was a member of a judo club.

{"abstract": "Vitiligo is a common, acquired, idiopathic depigmenting skin disorder. Although the exact pathogenesis remains unknown, genetic susceptibility and autoimmune responses play a role in vitiligo development. Previous studies have suggested that the D allele of the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene is associated with vitiligo in Indians and Koreans. Furthermore, significantly higher serum ACE levels have been demonstrated in patients with some autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders. The objectives were to investigate any association between the ACE I/D polymorphism and vitiligo susceptibility in an Indian population, and to compare serum ACE levels in patients with vitiligo and healthy subjects. The ACE I/D genotypes of 79 patients with vitiligo and 100 normal individuals were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification. A meta-analysis was done to compare the distribution of the ACE I/D alleles and genotypes in the current and three previous studies. Serum ACE levels were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A significant increase in the frequency of the ACE I/D D allele was evident in patients with vitiligo in both the case-control study [P=0\u00b7005; odds ratio (OR) 1\u00b787; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1\u00b722-2\u00b785] and the meta-analysis (P=0\u00b7044; OR 1\u00b744; 95% CI 1\u00b701-2\u00b706). Serum ACE levels were significantly increased in patients with vitiligo compared with healthy subjects (P<0\u00b70001). In agreement with earlier reports, the ACE I/D D allele is associated with vitiligo susceptibility in the Indian population. The significantly elevated serum ACE levels in our cohort of patients with vitiligo concur with those previously found in patients with some other autoimmune diseases.", "title": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme gene insertion/deletion polymorphism in Indian patients with vitiligo: a case-control study and meta-analysis.", "pmid": "23278772", "id": "496"},
{"abstract": "Several epidemiological studies have evaluated the association between the GNB3 C825T polymorphism and hypertension or stroke. The results of these studies were inconsistent; therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify these discrepancies. We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, and CBM databases, and manually searched reference lists of relevant papers, meeting abstracts, and relevant journals. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for dominant, recessive, and allelic models. A fixed or random effects model was separately adopted depending on study heterogeneity. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to detect study heterogeneity and examine result stability, respectively. Publication bias was tested using funnel plots, the Egger's regression test, and Begg's test. We screened 66 studies regarding hypertension and eight concerning stroke. A combined analysis showed that only the allelic model found a marginal association with hypertension (OR\u200a=\u200a1.07, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.01-1.13) and female gender (OR\u200a=\u200a1.11, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a0.99-1.24). However, no comparison models found an association with stroke (allelic model: OR\u200a=\u200a1.11, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a0.94-1.32; dominant model: OR\u200a=\u200a1.16, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a0.92-1.48; and recessive model: OR\u200a=\u200a1.05, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a0.97-1.14). Sensitivity analysis suggested that all models did not yield a relationship to hypertension or stroke among Asians. Besides, there was a lack of statistical association with hypertension in Caucasians, which maybe due to a small sample size. When we restricted the included studies to normal populations according to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, no association was found.

This study aims to assess whether the apelin and AGTRL1 genetic polymorphisms might contribute to essential hypertension or its related phenotypes. We recruited 1015 Han Chinese from 248 families with essential hypertension. Each individual was genotyped for 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in apelin and 6 SNPs in AGTRL1. Data were analyzed using the family-based association test (FBAT) and the haplotype-based association test (HBAT). FBAT analysis showed that two SNPs rs3761581 and T-1860C within apelin conferred significant association with hypertension and its related phenotypes even after correcting for age and gender. Three SNPs (rs7119375, rs10501367 and rs9943582) within AGTRL1 were found to be associated with hypertension, BMI and the onset age of hypertension, whereas after correction, only marginal associations were noted.

{"abstract": "Lung cancer is a major cause of cancer-related death in the developed countries and the overall survival rate has still an extremely poor. Although cigarette smoking is the main cause of lung cancer, not all smokers develop lung cancer, and a fraction of lifelong non-smokers will die from lung cancer. Genetic host factors have recently been implicated to account for some of the observed differences in lung cancer susceptibility. Various DNA alterations can be caused by exposure to environmental and endogenous carcinogens. Most of these alterations, if not repaired, may result in genetic instability, mutagenesis and cell death. DNA repair mechanisms are important for maintaining DNA integrity and preventing carcinogenesis. Recent genetic association studies on lung cancer risk have focused on identifying effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes, among which DNA repair genes are increasingly studied. Genetic variations in DNA repair genes are thought to modulate DNA repair capacity and are suggested to be related to lung cancer risk. We identified a sufficient number of epidemiologic studies on lung cancer to conduct a meta-analysis for genetic polymorphisms in nucleotide base repair (BER) pathway, focusing on 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1, X-ray cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1. The 399Gln/Gln genotype of the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer among Asians (OR=1.34, 95% CI=1.16-1.54) but not among Caucasians. Little evidence of associations has been found between other BER genes and lung cancer risk. Considering the data available, it can be conjectured that if there is any risk association between single SNP and lung cancer, this risk increase/decrease will probably be minimal. Advances in identification of new polymorphisms and in high-throughput genotyping techniques will facilitate analysis of multiple genes in multiple DNA repair pathways. Therefore, it is likely that the defining feature of future epidemiologic studies will be the simultaneous analysis of large samples of cases and controls.", "title": "Association of genetic polymorphisms in the base excision repair pathway with lung cancer risk: a meta-analysis.", "pmid": "16982113", "id": "501"},

However, the risk conferred in men living in China is unkown. We selected 6 previously identified variants as candidates to define their association with PCa in Chinese men. We genotyped 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1465618, rs1983891, rs339331, rs16901966, rs1447295 and rs10090154) using high resolution melting (HRM) analysis and assessed their association with PCa risk in a case-control study of 481 patients and 480 controls in a Chinese population. In addition, the individual and cumulative contribution for the risk of PCa and clinical covariates were analysed. We found that 5 of the 6 genetic variants were associated with PCa risk. The T allele of rs339331 and the G allele of rs16901966 showed a significant association with PCa susceptibility: OR (95%CI)= 0.78 (0.64-0.94), p<0.009 and OR (95%CI)= 0.66 (0.54-0.81), p<0.0001, as well as A allele of rs1447295 (OR [95%CI]=1.46 (1.17-1.84), p<0.001) and T allele of rs10090154 (OR [95%CI]= 0.58 (0.46-0.74), p<0.0001). rs339331(T) was associated with a 0.71-fold and 1.42-fold increase of PCa risk by dominant model (p=0.007) and recessive model (p=0.007). rs16901966 (G) was associated with a 0.51-fold and 1.98-fold increase of PCa risk by dominant model (p=0.006) and recessive model (p=0.0058). rs10090154 (T) was associated with a 1.89-fold and 0.53-fold increase of PCa risk by dominant model (p=0.000006) and recessive model (p=0.000006).

A case-control study was conducted with 196 EH cases and matched controls from male railway employees. Occupational stress was scaled by a validated Chinese version of the Occupational Stress Inventory. Information on risk factors for hypertension, including smoking, alcohol consumption, family hypertension history and body mass index, was collected by face to face interviews. Genotypes of GR BCL1 and G678S genes were determined with PCR-RFLP. Conditional logistic regression was applied to examine the interactions of occupational stress and GR gene polymorphisms with adjustment for potential confounders. A positive relationship was observed in the CG/GG genotype compared with the CC genotype in the GRBCL1 gene. The interaction between the GRBCL1 gene and occupational stress was statistically significant on EH. The odds ratio (OR) was 1.56 (95% CI: 0.93, 2.63) when comparing the CG/GG genotype of the GRBCL1 gene with low/medium personal strain with the CC genotype with low/medium strain, whereas the OR was 3.43 (95% CI: 1.45, 8.12) when comparing the same genotype with high strain with the same reference.

The 'A-G-C-C' haplotype constructed with rs1126477, rs1126478, rs2073495, and rs9110 was the risk factor to be ovarian cancer. The expression of LTF gene was lower in individuals with 'A-G-C-C' haplotype compared with that in individuals without 'A-G-C-C' haplotype.

{"abstract": "Identifying culprit genes for a complex trait in a homogeneous population such as the Japanese remains challenging. We aimed to use previous achievements of genome-wide association studies to identify precise susceptibility loci for inflammatory bowel disease in Japanese people and to simultaneously investigate the replication of recently identified susceptibility loci. An unrelated Japanese population of 174 Crohn's disease patients, 296 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and 394 healthy controls was consecutively enrolled in this study. Genotype and haplotype analyses focusing on susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease were performed using 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including 5 HapMap tag SNPs within surfactant, pulmonary-associated protein D (SFTPD) along with the 2 Caucasian susceptibility loci. We performed fine-scale mapping of trait-associated loci with the extension of a shattered coalescent process in a Bayesian framework. Epistasis on disease phenotypes was statistically explored with the interaction dendrogram. A minor allele G of rs911887 reached statistical significance for susceptibility to UC. The 2-allele haplotype GG comprising rs911887 and rs2243639 (Ala160Thr) within SFTPD was significantly associated with susceptibility to UC. A posterior density plot shows that trait-associated variants in the vicinity of rs911887 are likely to exist. An association between NKX2-3 and UC susceptibility was replicated and diverse evidence of epistasis in Japan was suggested. This preliminary study suggests that SFTPD is both a susceptibility gene and a disease-modifying gene for UC in Japanese. Replication of the causality and functional analyses of SFTPD is urgently warranted.", "title": "Genetic variants in surfactant, pulmonary-associated protein D (SFTPD) and Japanese susceptibility to ulcerative colitis.", "pmid": "19340882", "id": "511"},

Because slit-lamp examination may overlook latent deposits of exfoliation materials, an ocular biopsy is usually needed for a precise diagnosis. We evaluated a possible association between EX and BRVO using lysyl oxidase-like 1 (LOXL1) gene variants as alternative markers for EX. Allelic and genotypic frequencies of three LOXL1 variants (rs1048661, rs3825942, and rs2165241) were determined for 78 consecutive Japanese patients with BRVO (11 patients with exfoliation syndrome [EX+], 67 patients without exfoliation syndrome [EX-]), and 158 patients with cataract without EX (CT) as controls. The rs1048661 variant differed between the BRVO and CT groups in allelic and genotypic frequencies (p=0.0137 and p=0.0203, respectively). Subgroup analysis, compared to the CT group, showed that BRVO EX+ had significantly different allelic and genotypic frequencies of rs1048661 (p=0.00011 and p=0.000189, respectively), while BRVO EX- did not (p=0.175 and p=0.288, respectively). The frequencies of rs3825942 and rs2165241 did not differ between the BRVO and CT groups.

We examined whether the genetic variation predisposing to PCOS affected glycemic changes in women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and whether such an effect was modified by changes in body adiposity, especially during and after pregnancy. This is a longitudinal study in Tianjin, China. We genotyped 7 genome-wide association study-identified PCOS single nucleotide polymorphisms and assessed gestational weight gain and changes in glycemic traits and weight at 1 to 5 years postpartum in 1133 women with prior GDM. The main outcome measure was postpartum glycemic changes. The PCOS genetic risk score significantly interacted with postpartum weight reduction on changes in fasting glucose and 2-h glucose (P for interaction = .032 and .007; respectively) after multivariable adjustment. In women with postpartum weight reduction of \u2265 5 kg/y, the genetic risk score was associated with decreased fasting and 2-h glucose, whereas an opposite genetic effect was found in women who lost less weight. The association between postpartum weight reduction and glycemic improvement was more significant among women with a higher genetic risk score. In a large cohort of Chinese women with a history of GDM, our data for the first time indicate that the genetic predisposition to PCOS may interact with postpartum weight reduction on long-term glycemic changes, emphasizing the importance of postpartum weight management in prevention of diabetes in this subgroup of women.", "title": "Genetic Predisposition to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, Postpartum Weight Reduction, and Glycemic Changes: A Longitudinal Study in Women With Prior Gestational Diabetes.", "pmid": "26431507", "id": "514"},

This study evaluated the ApoE genetic polymorphism and its relation to MetS defined by the modified National Cholesterol Education Program and International Diabetes Federation criteria in a population-based cross-sectional survey of an elderly Chinese population in Beijing, China. Genotypes of 937 men and 1385 women were included in the study.

We applied a logistic regression model to derive adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals. In this Chinese population, the \u025b2, \u025b3, and \u025b4 allele frequencies were 8.3%, 83.4%, and 8.3% for men and 8.7%, 82.9%, and 8.4% for women, respectively. In men, concentrations of fasting triglycerides were higher among the APOE2 and E4 subjects; and a lower level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was observed in the APOE4 group. There were approximately linear associations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with APOE genotype groups in both men and women.

{"abstract": "A variety of evidence suggests brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as a candidate gene for schizophrenia, and several genetic studies have shown a significant association between the disease and certain SNPs within BDNF (specifically, Val66Met and C270T). According to a recent study, the functional microsatellite marker BDNF-LCPR (BDNF-linked complex polymorphic region), which affects the expression level of BDNF, is associated with bipolar disorder. The goals of our current study were to 1) evaluate the quality of HapMap-based linkage disequilibrium (LD) tagging of BDNF-LCPR, 2) examine whether these tagging SNPs are associated with schizophrenia in a Japanese population, and 3) conduct a meta-analysis of the two most extensively studied polymorphisms: Val66Met and C270T. We genotyped eight tagging SNPs, including Val66Met and C270T. Our LD evaluation showed that BDNF-LCPR could be represented by these tagging SNPs in controls (with 73.5% allelic coverage). However, the functional A1 allele was not captured due to its low minor allele frequency (2.2%). In a case-control study (1117 schizophrenics and 1102 controls), no association was found in single-marker or multimarker analysis. Moreover, in a meta-analysis, the Val66Met polymorphism was not associated with schizophrenia, whereas C270T showed a trend for association in a fixed model (p=0.036), but not in a random model (p=0.053). From these findings, we conclude that if BDNF is indeed associated with schizophrenia, the A1 allele in BDNF-LCPR would be the most promising candidate.

A total of 280 consecutive lacunar infarction patients and 306 unrelated population-based controls that had been matched for age and sex were examined using a case-control design. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PRKCH gene (rs3783799 and rs2230500) were genotyped with ligase detection reaction (LDR) and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype analysis were also investigated between these two groups. Overall alleles and genotype frequencies were similar between cases and controls. No significant association was detected with the gene polymorphisms mentioned above and lacunar infarction; no significant difference was found with haplotype analysis between these two groups. None of the two SNPs showed significant association with lacunar infarction in the whole subjects before and after adjustment for conventional stroke risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia). The frequencies of PRKCH differed largely from those in the Japanese population.

We also examined mirtazapine's effects on the serum BDNF and plasma levels of catecholamine metabolites in these patients. Eighty-four patients who met the DSM-IV-TR criteria for MDD were treated with only mirtazapine for 4 weeks. The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was detected by direct sequencing in the region, and serum BDNF levels and plasma levels of catecholamine metabolites were measured by ELISA and HPLC-ECD, respectively. Mirtazapine treatment for 4 weeks significantly increased serum BDNF levels in the responders, whereas nonresponders showed significant decreases. No association was found between either of the two genotypes (Val/Val vs. Met-carriers) and the response to mirtazapine at T4 or the serum BDNF levels at T0. Mirtazapine did not alter the plasma levels of homovanillic acid (HVA) or 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG). Discussion The dynamics of serum BDNF levels, but not plasma levels of HVA and MHPG, reflect the response to mirtazapine treatment; the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism in patients with depression is, however, associated with neither a particular response to mirtazapine treatment nor baseline serum BDNF levels.

{"abstract": "To estimate the genetic factors influencing depressed mood caused by job stress, a total of 243 employees at a manufacturing company and a local hospital in Japan (mean age 40.8+/-10.3 years) were recruited with informed consent. The Brief Job Stress Questionnaire was used to assess the present status of stress. Alcohol consumption and smoking were assessed as lifestyle factors. DNA samples were prepared to detect gene polymorphisms of serotonin transporter (5HTT), aldehyde dehydrogenase 2, D2 dopamine receptor, and cytochrome p450 2A6. The relationship between job stress, lifestyle factors and these polymorphisms was assessed for each gender. The level of depressed mood for female subjects was significantly higher among the carriers of two short (s/s) alleles of the 5HTT regulatory region compared with the carriers of one (s/l) or two (l/l) long alleles (Mann-Whitney U test, p<0.05). The odds ratio of depressed mood also confirmed this relationship for the female subjects, whereas there was no relationship for the male subjects. When social support was taken into consideration, the depressed mood score for those who had high support was significantly lower than for those who had low support, irrespective of 5HTT polymorphisms and gender. Job stress may elicit biological responses that contribute to depressed mood in relation to 5HTT polymorphisms, and social support may reduce depressed mood irrespective of 5HTT polymorphisms.", "title": "Association between serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms and depressed mood caused by job stress in Japanese workers.", "pmid": "18360696", "id": "529"},

{"abstract": "The role of dopamine neurotransmitter in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remains controversial. Many molecular studies focusing on dopamine receptors have attempted to analyze the gene polymorphisms involved in dopaminergic transmission. Of these, rs1800497 (TaqIA) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene has been focused on by the most attention. However, this locus has recently been identified within the exon 8 of ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 (ANKK1), giving rise to a Glu713-to-Lys substitution in the putative ANKK1 protein. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis to determine whether ANKK1 polymorphism influences the risk of ADHD and examined the relationship between rs1800497 genetic variant and the etiology of ADHD. Relevant case-control studies were retrieved by database searches and selected according to established inclusion criteria. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the strength of the associations. Meta-regression, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis and cumulative meta-analysis were performed. A total of 11 studies with 1645 cases and 1641 controls were included. In the dominant model, the rs1800497 locus was associated with ADHD, with a pooled OR of 1.785 (95% CI=1.068-2.984, p=0.027). Subgroup analysis for ethnicity indicated that the polymorphism was associated with ADHD in Africans (OR=3.286, 95% CI=1.434-7.527, p=0.005), but not in East Asians (OR=1.513, 95% CI=0.817-2.805, p=0.188) and Caucasians (OR=1.740, 95% CI=0.928-3.263, p=0.084). However, the results of meta-regression indicated that publication date (p=0.601), source of controls (p=0.685), ethnicity (p=0.755) and diagnostic criteria (p=0.104) could not explain the potential sources of heterogeneity.

The purified IL4-BP was immobilized via a single biotinylated SH group near the carboxyl end to a biosensor matrix and analysed in real time for interaction with IL-4 and IL-4 variants. IL-4 was bound to IL4-BP at a molar ratio of approximately 1:1. The association and dissociation at pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl had rate constants of 1.9 +/- 0.3 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 and 2 +/- 1 x 10(-3) s-1, respectively. Glycosylation and engineered amino acid substitutions of IL4-BP did not alter the kinetic constants as shown by a parallel analysis of IL4-BP variants produced in Escherichia coli or Chinese hamster ovary cells. The rate of association was only slightly affected in binding-deficient variants [E9Q]IL-4 and [R88Q]IL-4 and by acidic pH down to values of 4.5, but it was reduced up to fivefold at higher ionic strength. The rate of dissociation was increased 70-fold and 150-fold with the IL-4 variants and fivefold at an acidic pH of 4.5, but it was not affected by high ionic strength. Temperatures between 6 degrees C and 37 degrees C yielded similar rates of IL-4 dissociation and only a marginally reduced rate of IL-4 association at 6 degrees C. These results indicate that the high-affinity binding of IL-4 to its receptor (Kd approximately 100 pM) is mainly the result of an unusually high association rate. The IL-4/IL4-BP interaction appears to be dominated by charge effects.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time the existence of three new polymorphisms in perforin promoter and, contrary to what was stated, the presence of these SNPs does not alter the levels of protein expression.

{"abstract": "Recently, a new polymorphic gene family called the major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene A (MICA) was discovered about 40 kb centromeric to HLA-B gene. The MICA protein, expressed on epithelial cells and many kinds of tumor cells, serves to regulate immune function. The MICA protein is thought to activate immune function on mucosal tissue by binding to NKG2D which is expressed on most natural killer cells, CD8 positive T cells, and gamma delta T cells. An association between MICA gene polymorphisms and the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has also been reported. This study was designed to test this association in Japanese patients with OSCC. The (GCT)(n) polymorphisms of the MICA gene was investigated in 123 patients with OSCC and 188 normal controls using polymerase chain reaction amplification and denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Five alleles, namely A4, A5, A6, A9, and A5.1, were found in both groups. The phenotype frequency of the MICA-A5.1 allele was significantly higher in patients with OSCC when compared with normal controls (OR 1.707, 95% CI 0.76-3.45, P=0.042). Also, the microsatellite frequency of the MICA-A5.1 allele was significantly higher in patients with OSCC compared with normal controls (OR 1.664, 95% CI 0.82-3.42, P=0.021). Lastly, the frequency of the MICA-A5.1 allele was significantly higher in those with lymph node metastasis from OSCC compared with normal controls (OR 2.605, 95% CI 1.14-5.27, P=0.026). These results suggest that the MICA-A5.1 allele may be associated with an increased susceptibility to OSCC in Japan.", "title": "An association between the MICA-A5.1 allele and an increased susceptibility to oral squamous cell carcinoma in Japanese patients.", "pmid": "17559497", "id": "548"},

Nearly half of the Japanese population is sensitive to alcohol due to a genetic polymorphism in low K(m) aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2). In the present study, we investigated the effects of the ALDH2 genotype on both self-reported alcohol-associated symptoms and alcohol drinking behavior among Japanese university students. The study subjects were 423 (389 males and 34 females) university students in a medical university. The subjects completed a questionnaire regarding self-reported alcohol-associated symptoms and alcohol drinking behavior. The ALDH2 genotype was determined through digestion of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products by a restriction enzyme Ksp632I. The frequency of alcohol-associated symptoms generally increased in the order ALDH2*1/*1, ALDH2*1/*2, ALDH2*2/*2 among males. The frequency of those who drink > or = 5 days/week was less than 10% in all genotype groups. However, the frequency of those who drink 1-4 days/week was significantly higher in ALDH2*1/*1 than that in ALDH2*1/*2 and in ALDH2*2/*2. A similar tendency also was observed in females.

The clinical characteristics and smoking status were obtained from the health screening record. The incidence of diabetes was 1.5-fold higher in the GSTT1 and GSTM1 null (-) genotype than the GSTT1 and GSTM1 present (+) genotype, respectively. Although the effect of each null genotype was not significant, the combined GSTT1+/GSTM1+ genotypes conferred a significant reduction in risk of diabetes in comparison with the other combinations of genotypes (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.12-0.71).

All participants were genotyped for 366 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 34 genes selected from those involved in neurotransmitter systems. Association analyses were performed using PLINK version 1.07 software. Allelic analyses before adjustment for multiple tests showed that 15 polymorphisms within seven genes were associated with AUD (p<0.05).

{"abstract": "Depression and anxiety disorders often coexist clinically and both are known to have a genetic basis, but the mode of inheritance is too complicated to be determined so far. Serotonin is the biogenic amine neurotransmitter most commonly associated with depression and anxiety. Since tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin biosynthesis, its role in the pathophysiology of these psychiatric diseases has been intensively studied. In this study, we examined whether polymorphism of the TPH1 gene is related to the etiology of major depression, anxiety and comorbid depression and anxiety. Five single nucleoside polymorphisms of the TPH1 gene were studied in a population-based sample of postpartum Taiwanese women consisting of 120 subjects with depression or/and anxiety and 86 matched normal controls. A significant difference (P = 0.0107) in genotype frequency for the T27224C polymorphism was found between the comorbid and normal groups, and risk analysis showed that the C allele conferred a strong protective effect (odds ratio = 0.27; 95% confident interval = 0.11-0.7). Three-allele haplotypes involving T27224C polymorphism were constructed and haplotype associations between particular haplotype combinations and various diseases identified. However, the associations were weak and the overall haplotype frequency profiles in all groups were similar. The results suggest that depression, anxiety, and comorbid depression and anxiety disorders may have related etiologies. In addition, this study suggests that the TPH1 gene might play a role in the pathogenesis of these closely related disorders.", "title": "Association of tryptophan hydroxylase gene polymorphism with depression, anxiety and comorbid depression and anxiety in a population-based sample of postpartum Taiwanese women.", "pmid": "15544576", "id": "566"},

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of RAD51 G135C and XRCC3 Thr241Met genotypes on AML susceptibility. We conducted a systematic search of three databases including PubMed and EMBASE for the period up to 20 February 2013 and identified 43 relevant studies. Six eligible studies were eventually selected for RAD51 (1764 cases and 3469 controls) and six studies for XRCC3 (1352 cases and 2582 controls). Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of AML associated with RAD51 and XRCC3 were appropriately calculated based on \ufb01xed- or random-effects models. The quality of studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Subgroup analyses were performed among Asian, Caucasian and other populations. The pooled results showed that the leukemia risk was not significantly associated with RAD51: the same results were obtained among any subgroup analysis. No significant association was demonstrated for AML risk with XRCC3 in the total population, but elevated associations were observed in Caucasians for the homozygote and recessive comparison (Met/Met vs. Thr/Thr, OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.09-2.57, p = 0.019; recessive model, OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.19-2.65, p = 0.005).

Besides, 65 out of 257 AD patients, 11 with D/D genotype, 28 with I/I genotype and 26 with I/D genotype were recruited. Their plasma ACE protein levels were measured by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay and compared for their corresponding ACE gene indel polymorphism. patients with ACE-I/I homozygote were less likely to be associated with AD, compared with both I/D and D/D (OR: 0.601; 95% CI: 0.372-0.969; P = 0.037), or only I/D genotype (OR: 0.584; 95% CI: 0.349-0.976; P = 0.040). There were significantly different plasma ACE protein levels among these three different genotype groups (P = 0.023).

OPV-like strains were the only pathogen identified in 208 children who were diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infection (24.5%), acute gastroenteritis (16.8%) or upper respiratory tract infection (10.6%). Timing of poliovirus isolation relative to the tOPV vaccination was unusual in 59 patients, including 6 before any dose and 53 more than 10 weeks after the 3rd or later dose of tOPV. Sequence analyses of the VP1, 2C and 3C/D regions for 19 poliovirus isolates revealed that 4 had previously reported neurovirulence reversions, 1 had intertypic recombination, and 6 had both. No patient had neurological complications, but 3 died of myocarditis, including 2 with recombinant strains and 1 who never received OPV.

The aim of the present study was to analyze the potential association between two functional miR-146a polymorphisms (rs2910164 and rs57095329) and multiple sclerosis (MS) in the Han Chinese population. A cohort of 525 patients and 568 healthy controls were genotyped to detect the two polymorphisms by SNaPshot. No significant differences were detected in the distribution of the two miR-146a polymorphisms between the patients and controls (P > 0.05). However, stratification by gender showed a statistically significant difference in the frequency of the genotype rs2910164 between MS patients and control females (P=0.009). Further stratification analysis by subgroup revealed that the miR-146a rs2910164 C allele conferred a higher risk of developing relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) (P=0.018). In addition, the rs2910164 C allele was significantly associated with increased expression of miR-146a in patients with RRMS (P=0.025).

The blood samples of 232 cervical cancer patients and 332 non-cancer control subjects who managed at Seoul National University Hospital from 1999 to 2002 were collected. Polymorphism in MMP-1 promoter -1607 region was determined using TaqMan method. Allele frequency and genotype distribution in the cervical cancer group were compared with those of the control group to determine whether this polymorphism elevates the susceptibility of Korean women to cervical cancer. The relationship between this SNP and cancer invasiveness was also evaluated by collating clinicopathologic data of those in the cancer group, such as FIGO stage, lymph node status, histologic type and parametrial invasion. In the cervical cancer group, the allele frequency of 2G was 66.1%, in the control group 68.2%, showing no significant difference (P=0.41). Similarly the genotypes with insertion (2G/2G) or deletion (1G/1G) polymorphism showed no increased risk for cervical cancer susceptibility compared with 1G/2G genotype. A subgroup analysis of the clinicopathologic parameters in cancer group also showed no significant difference suggesting the lack of an association between SNP of the MMP-1 promoter -1607 bp region and cervical cancer invasiveness.

{"abstract": "Recently, genetic variations in MICA (lead single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] rs2596542) were identified by a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to be associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Japanese patients. In the present study, we sought to determine whether this SNP is predictive of HCC development in the Caucasian population as well. An extended region around rs2596542 was genotyped in 1924 HCV-infected patients from the Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort Study (SCCS). Pair-wise correlation between key SNPs was calculated both in the Japanese and European populations (HapMap3: CEU and JPT). To our surprise, the minor allele A of rs2596542 in proximity of MICA appeared to have a protective impact on HCC development in Caucasians, which represents an inverse association as compared to the one observed in the Japanese population. Detailed fine-mapping analyses revealed a new SNP in HCP5 (rs2244546) upstream of MICA as strong predictor of HCV-related HCC in the SCCS (univariable p=0.027; multivariable p=0.0002, odds ratio=3.96, 95% confidence interval=1.90-8.27). This newly identified SNP had a similarly directed effect on HCC in both Caucasian and Japanese populations, suggesting that rs2244546 may better tag a putative true variant than the originally identified SNPs. Our data confirms the MICA/HCP5 region as susceptibility locus for HCV-related HCC and identifies rs2244546 in HCP5 as a novel tagging SNP.

ZnT8A were detected in 862 subjects (57.3%), with the highest frequencies and median titers being associated with the shortest duration of disease. ZnT8A were present at similar frequencies in non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics, but significantly less prevalent in those of Asian ancestry. Sera containing ZnT8A selectively recognizing at least one of the SLC30A8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (encoding ZnT8A) were detected in all populations; however, Trp-specific sera were much less frequent in non-Hispanic blacks, consistent with the anticipated lower frequency of the SLC30A8 rs13266634 T allele in African American populations. ZnT8A positivity was associated with HLA-DQ8, but this was primarily due to the DRB1*0404-DQ8 haplotype.

PCA, ABG, and PA occur in increased frequency in patients with type 1 diabetes and their relatives and are considered \"minor\" components of forms of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS). A customized radioimmunoprecipitation assay was applied to 6,749 samples from the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium to measure ATP4A autoreactivity. Autoantibody prevalence was correlated with variants in HLA class II, PTPN22, and CTLA4 genes. With an ATP4A radioimmunoprecipitation assay, PCA were detected in sera from 20.9% of affected individuals. PCA prevalence increased with age and was greater in females (25.3%) than males (16.5%) and among Hispanics (36.3%) and blacks (26.2%) compared with non-Hispanic whites (20.8%) and Asians (16.7%). PCA and other organ-specific autoantibodies GAD65, IA-2, thyroid peroxidase (TPO), 21-hydroxylase (21-OH), and transglutaminase (TG) clustered within families with heritability estimates from 71 to 95%. PCA clustered with TPO, 21-OH, and persistent GAD65 autoantibodies but not with celiac (TG) or IA-2 autoantibodies. PCA-positive subjects showed an increased frequency of DRB1*0404, DPB1*0201, and PTPN22 R620W (rs2476601-T) and a decreased frequency of DRB1*0101, DPB1*0301, and CTLA4 CT60 (rs3087243-T). Genetic variants accounted for 4-5% of the heritable risk for PCA. The same alleles were associated with other autoantibody phenotypes in a consistent pattern. Whereas most of the heritable risk for PCA and other antibodies reflects genetic effects that are tissue specific, parietal cell autoimmunity is a major pathogenetic contributor in APS2.

We examined a CTLA4 polymorphism and its relationship to human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes and autoantibodies for glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) and IA-2 in Japanese children with Type 1 diabetes. The study group consisted of 125 childhood-onset Japanese subjects (50 males, 75 females) with Type 1 diabetes. The CTLA4 A/G polymorphism at position 49 was analysed using a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The HLA-DRB1 and DQB1 genotypes were defined by DNA analysis using PCR-sequence-specific oligonucleotide (PCR-SSO) probes. The GAD65 autoantibody (GAD65Ab) and IA-2 autoantibody (IA-2Ab) titres were measured using radioimmunoassay. The distribution of genotype frequencies differs between subjects with Type 1 diabetes (GG: 46%, AG: 50%, AA: 5%) and controls (GG: 39%, AG: 44%, AA: 17%) (P < 0.01). The frequency of the G allele is higher in the diabetes group than in the controls (P < 0.05). When the subjects were subdivided according to HLA genotype, the two major HLA high-risk groups, with DR9-DQ9 and DR4-DQ4, that are unique to Japanese populations showed no difference in their CTLA4 polymorphism frequencies. Although no association between the CTLA4 polymorphism and the prevalence of GAD65Ab was found, CTLA4 GG subjects that had been newly diagnosed (< 9 months) had significantly higher levels of autoantibodies than AG subjects (P < 0.01). The prevalence and titres of IA-2Ab were not associated with the CTLA4 polymorphism. The CTLA4 gene might confer a susceptibility to childhood-onset Type 1 diabetes in the Japanese population. The association between this CTLA4 polymorphism and the HLA genotype was similar for both major groups with HLA high-risk alleles.

Systematic search for NOD1 gene polymorphisms in Japanese sarcoidosis patients identified two alleles, 796G-haplotype (156C, 483C, 796G, 1722G) and 796A-haplotype (156G, 483T, 796A, 1722A). Allelic discrimination of 73 sarcoidosis patients and 215 healthy individuals showed that the frequency of 796A-type allele was significantly higher in sarcoidosis patients and the ORs were significantly elevated in NOD1-796G/A and 796A/A genotypes (OR [95% CI]=2.250 [1.084, 4.670] and 3.243 [1.402, 7.502], respectively) as compared to G/G genotype, showing an increasing trend across the 3 genotypes (P=0.006 for trend). A similar association was found when 52 interstitial pneumonia patients were used as disease controls. Functional studies showed that the NOD1 796A-allele was associated with reduced expression leading to diminished NF-kappaB activation in response to intracellular P. acnes.

{"abstract": "A common LH variant (V-LH) with Trp8Arg and Ile15Thr is often associated with ovarian dysfunction primarily in the Japanese population, and the LHB gene encoding V-LH is linked with a hyperfunctional promoter that could partly compensate for the somewhat weak biological effect of the V-LH in the Finnish and other several populations. We analyzed the promoter region in a Japanese infertile woman homozygous for the V-LH, to examine whether the hyperfunctional promoter is present or absent in the Japanese V-LH carriers with ovarian dysfunction. Direct sequencing was performed for a 661 bp promoter region from -8 to -668 bp of LHB, revealing homozygosity for eight nucleotide substitutions (-238A>G, -276G>A, -489C>A, -490T>A, -504T>A, -506T>C, -525T>G, and -552C>T) that are identical to those found in the hyperfunctional promoter. The results suggest that ovarian dysfunction frequently observed in the Japanese V-LH carriers would be due to some population-specific genetic and/or environmental factor(s) rather than to the lack of the hyperfunctional promoter and the resultant low biological effect of the V-LH. In addition, the tight linkage between the two missense substitutions in the coding region and the eight nucleotide substitutions in the promoter region of LHB appears to be common to various ethnic groups.", "title": "Association of common LH variant with hyperfunctional promoter in a Japanese infertile woman.", "pmid": "16410673", "id": "588"},

Two common variants in the MTHFR gene (C677T and A1298C) have been associated with reduced enzyme activity, thereby making MTHFR polymorphisms a potential candidate cancer-predisposing factor. To evaluate the C677T and A1298C functional polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene and their associations with breast cancer risk, as well as the potential modifying effect by plasma folate status on the MTHFR-associated risk, a hospital-based case-control study was conducted on a Taiwanese population consisting of 146 histologically confirmed incident breast cancer cases and their 285 age-matched controls without a history of cancer. A PCR-RFLP method was used for MTHFR polymorphism genotyping and RIA was used to measure the plasma folate. Statistical evaluations were performed using logistic regression analysis. The plasma folate level was inversely associated with breast cancer risk with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.52 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.26-1.05] observed among women who were in the highest plasma folate tertile.

To identify groups at high risk for OSCC by simultaneously analysing both genetic and environmental risk factors. Methods A multistage genome-wide association study of OSCC in Japanese individuals with a total of 1071 cases and 2762 controls was performed. Two associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as well as smoking and alcohol consumption, were evaluated as genetic and environmental risk factors, respectively, and their interactions were also evaluated. Risk alleles of rs1229984 (ADH1B) and rs671 (ALDH2) were highly associated with OSCC (odds ratio (OR)=4.08, p=4.4\u00d710(-40) and OR=4.13, p=8.4\u00d710(-76), respectively). Also, smoking and alcohol consumption were identified as risk factors for OSCC development. By integrating both genetic and environmental risk factors, it was shown that the combination of rs1229984 and rs671 risk alleles with smoking and alcohol consumption was associated with OSCC. Compared with subjects with no more than one environmental or genetic risk factor, the OR reached 146.4 (95% CI 50.5 to 424.5) when both environmental and genetic risk factors were present. Without the genetic risks, alcohol consumption did not correlate with OSCC. In people with one or two genetic risk factors, the combination of alcohol consumption and smoking increased OSCC risk. Analysis of ADH1B and ALDH2 variants is valuable for secondary prevention of OSCC in high-risk patients who smoke and drink alcohol. In this study, SNP genotyping demonstrated that the ADH1B and/or ALDH2 risk alleles had an interaction with smoking and, especially, alcohol consumption.

We sought to further investigate the eight IL1A SNPs for association with endometriosis using an independent sample of 3908 endometriosis cases and 8568 controls of European and Japanese ancestry. The study was conducted between October 2013 and July 2014. By leveraging GWA data from our previous multi-ethnic GWA meta-analysis for endometriosis, we imputed variants in the IL1A region, using a recent 1000 Genomes reference panel. After combining summary statistics for the eight SNPs from our European and Japanese imputed data with the published results, a fixed-effect meta-analysis was performed. An additional meta-analysis restricted to endometriosis cases with moderate-to-severe (revised American Fertility Society stage 3 or 4) disease versus controls was also performed. All eight IL1A SNPs successfully replicated at P < 0.014 in the European imputed data with concordant direction and similar size to the effects reported in the original Japanese studies. Of these, three SNPs (rs6542095, rs3783550 and rs3783525) also showed association with endometriosis at a nominal P < 0.05 in our independent Japanese sample. Fixed-effect meta-analysis of the eight SNPs for moderate-to-severe endometriosis produced a genome-wide significant association for rs6542095 (odds ratio = 1.21; 95% confidence interval = 1.13-1.29; P = 3.43 \u00d7 10(-8)). The meta-analysis for moderate-to-severe endometriosis included results of moderate-to-severe endometriosis cases from our European data sets and all endometriosis cases from the Japanese data sets, as disease stage information was not available for endometriosis cases in the Japanese data sets. SNP rs6542095 is located \u223c2.3 kb downstream of the IL1A gene and \u223c6.9 kb upstream of cytoskeleton-associated protein 2-like (CKAP2L) gene. The IL1A gene encodes the IL1a protein, a member of the interleukin 1 cytokine family which is involved in various immune responses and inflammatory processes. These results provide important replication in an independent Japanese sample and, for the first time, association of the IL1A locus in endometriosis patients of European ancestry. SNPs within the IL1A locus may regulate other genes, but if IL1A is the target, our results provide supporting evidence for a link between inflammatory responses and the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The research was funded by grants from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council and Wellcome Trust.

{"abstract": "Polymorphisms at the glutathione S-transferase (GST) were associated with asthma-related phenotypes. We hypothesized that the GSTP1 and GSTM1 genotypes could modify the effects of household environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) on childhood wheezing illness. We conducted a case-control study comprised of 216 lifetime wheezing children and 185 nonwheezing controls, all of whom were selected from 2524 fourth- to ninth-grade school children in southern Taiwan. Homozygous GSTP1 Ile-105 was significantly associated with current wheezing (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.04-3.12), but insignificantly associated with ever wheezing (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 0.82-1.94). The risks of ever or current wheezing on GSTM1 null genotype were positive but not statistically significant. Although household ETS exposure was not associated with wheezing illness, after excluding subjects having in utero ETS or active smoking habits, the adverse effects of household ETS exposure differed significantly by GSTP1-105 genotypes. In children without any ETS exposure at home, GSTP1 Ile-105 homozygosity was significantly related to increased risks for both ever wheezing (OR = 2.29, 95% CI 1.17-4.49) and current wheezing (OR = 4.86, 95% CI 1.86-12.70). In children with household ETS exposure, the risks of wheezing illness did not increase for those carrying two GSTP1 Ile-105 alleles. Children carrying any GSTP1 Val-105 allele were at a significantly greater risk of both ever and current wheezing when exposed to ETS, with a clear dose-response relationship to the number of smokers at home.

We investigated the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) with dietary fat intake or fatty acid (FA) composition in serum phospholipids, plasma adiponectin, and insulin resistance. Nondiabetic subjects (n = 1194) were genotyped for three ADIPOQ SNPs (-11377C>G; 45T>G; 276G>T) after screening of eight sites. Dietary fat intake, FA composition in serum phospholipids, adiponectin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were also measured. The 276G carriers (n = 1082) showed lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.024) and adiponectin (P < 0.001) but higher glucose (P = 0.015) and HOMA-IR (P = 0.005) than 276T/T subjects (n = 112). No associations were found in other SNPs. After adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, and the proportion of 18:2\u03c96 and 18:3\u03c93 (biomarkers of long term essential FA intake), the 276G carriers showed lower proportions of total \u03c93FA (P = 0.026), 20:5\u03c93 (P = 0.021), and 22:5\u03c93 (P = 0.024) in serum phospholipids.

To further define the HLA-linked gene and other genetic factors for predisposition of silicosis, we determined for HLA-DQ and DP alleles using the polymerase chain reaction and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes and made a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the fourth component of complement (C4) genes, immunoglobulin lambda variable chain (IGLV) gene, and T-cell receptor alpha and beta genes in 46 Japanese patients with silicosis. The frequency of DQB1*0401 (relative risk [RR] = 2.2, P < 0.02) was increased and that of DQB1*0601 (RR = 0.36, P < 0.01) was decreased in the patients. RFLP analysis of C4 and IGLV genes showed significant association between silicosis and a specific RFLP pattern of C4A3-C4B5 allotype (RR = 2.3, P < 0.05) and that of IGLV 5.3 kb (RR = 0.33, P < 0.003).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of genetic variations in the TGF-\u00df receptor type III (TGFBR3) on asthma and on its related phenotypes in the general population. A cohort of 2,118 subjects aged from 10 to 18 years responded to a questionnaire concerning asthma symptoms and risk factors.

A total of 906 CD patients having TNFSF15 genotype data and clinical information were recruited from CD registry database of a tertiary referral center. The association between five TNFSF15 SNPs (rs4574921, rs3810936, rs6478108, rs6478109, and rs7848647) and various clinical parameters including stricture, non-perianal penetrating complications, bowel resection, and reoperation was investigated. Among the five SNPs, rs6478108 CC genotype was associated with the development of stricture and non-perianal penetrating complications during follow-up (HR for stricture=1.706, 95% confidence interval 1.178-2.471, P=0.005; HR for non-perianal penetrating complications=1.667, 95% confidence interval 1.127-2.466, P=0.010), and rs4574921 CC genotype was associated with the development of perianal fistula (HR=2.386, 95% confidence interval 1.204-4.727, P=0.013) by multivariate analysis. However, there was no significant association of cumulative operation and reoperation rate with 5 SNPs of TNFSF15. In Korean patients with CD, non-risk allele homozygotes of TNFSF15 SNPs rs6478108 and rs4574921 are independent genetic predictive factors for the development of strictures/non-perianal penetrating complications and perianal fistula, respectively.", "title": "TNFSF15 is an independent predictor for the development of Crohn's disease-related complications in Koreans.", "pmid": "24835165", "id": "619"},

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the correlation between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in the APOA5 gene and TG in subjects and to search for possible associations of the APOA5 gene variants and common haplotypes with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG). We examined the case-control subjects including 100 HTG patients and 243 unrelated healthy control. The genes were screened for SNPs by direct sequencing in 48 genetically unrelated individuals. Six SNPs (-1390C>T, -1020G>A, -3A>G, V150M, G182C and 1259T>C) were genotyped in case and control populations. In this study, our results indicated a strong association between APOA5 SNP -3A>G and G182C and elevated TG levels (p<0.001). Analysis of the SNPs from APOA5 gene has identified major haplotype showing very strong association with HTG, CGGGTT (p<0.001). Likelihood ratio test (LRT) of these six SNPs revealed that haplotypes were strong independent predictors of HTG (p<0.001). Haplotype-trend logistic regression (HTR) analysis revealed a significant association between the CGGGGC (haplotype 2) and CGGGTT (haplotype 4) and HTG (OR=2.48, 95% CI=1.06-5.76 and OR=8.54, 95% CI=2.66-27.42, respectively).

We analyzed resistin gene polymorphisms and examined their association with serum resistin level and obesity phenotypes in humans. Sixty young, obese, non-diabetic subjects taking no medication were studied. DNA sequencing and genotyping of identified single nucleotide polymorphisms were performed. Associations between polymorphisms and serum resistin level, BMI, body composition, fat distribution, and several indices of insulin sensitivity were examined. Moreover, single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region were examined for their influence on resistin gene transcriptional activity using luciferase reporter vectors. Ten non-coding single nucleotide polymorphisms were found. The -638G>A, -420C>G, and -358G>A polymorphisms in the promoter region showed marked linkage disequilibrium with each other, and were associated with serum resistin level; however, there was no association between these polymorphisms and parameters related to adiposity or insulin resistance. The results of luciferase assay revealed that -638G>A together with the -420C>G polymorphism influenced resistin gene transcriptional activity.

Here, we have investigated 16 known FOXO3A SNPs in an extensive collection of 1,762 German centenarians/nonagenarians and younger controls and provide evidence that polymorphisms in this gene were indeed associated with the ability to attain exceptional old age. The FOXO3A association was considerably stronger in centenarians than in nonagenarians, highlighting the importance of centenarians for genetic longevity research. Our study extended the initial finding observed in Japanese men to women and indicates that both genders were likely to be equally affected by variation in FOXO3A.

{"abstract": "The association of L-myc polymorphism with cancer susceptibility and prognosis has produced conflicting results. This may have been due to racial/ethnic differences and methodological variations in the studies, such as, control selection and case stratification. Therefore, we investigated the genotype distribution of the L-myc polymorphism in 169 lung cancer patients and 169 non-cancer controls, and analyzed the association of this polymorphism with cancer susceptibility and prognosis in relation to age-specific controls as well as stratified cases. The genotype frequencies in the Taiwanese non-cancer controls were 0.56 (L) and 0.44 (S). Chi-square (chi(2)) analysis indicated a significant difference in the Taiwanese genotype distribution of L-myc compared with that of African-Americans (P=0.001). Logistic regression analysis of cases/controls, adjusted for both age and sex, indicated that an increased frequency of the LL genotype was observed in early-staged patients compared with the non-cancer controls (OR=0.43, 95% CI, 0.20-0.94, P=0.03). In addition, the frequency of the LL genotype was significantly higher in stages I+II patients (47.4%) than in stages III+IV patients (28.4%) (P=0.05). Furthermore, the S allele frequency was significantly increased in stages III+IV patients (P=0.005). As both L-myc and p53 polymorphisms were analyzed for their prognostic value, the patients with an S allele of the L-myc gene and a Pro/Pro variant genotype of the p53 gene had significantly poorer prognoses compared with other patients (P=0.004, by the log rank test).

{"abstract": "Aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA), as a clinical syndrome caused by aspirin, is characterized by lung inflammation and reversible bronchoconstriction. Recently, the altered trafficking and diminished airway reactivity have been implicated in allergic airway remodeling. The stromal membrane-associated protein 1-like (SMAP1L) exerts common and distinct functions in vesicle trafficking including endocytosis. The disturbance of pulmonary surfactant synthesis has been elucidated to be associated with asthma experimentally. Moreover, in alveolar type II (ATII) cells that synthesize pulmonary surfactant, alterations of clathrin-dependent endocytosis cause disturbance at the surfactant function, suggesting that SMAP1L, which directly interacts with clathrin, could be associated with asthma and related phenotypes. To verify our hypothesis that SMAP1L could play a role in the development of AIA, this study investigated associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the SMAP1L gene and AIA. We conducted an association study between 19 SNPs of the SMAP1L gene and AIA in a total of 592 Korean subjects including 163 AIA and 429 aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA) patients. Associations between polymorphisms of SMAP1L and AIA were analyzed with sex, smoking status, atopy, and body mass index as covariates. Logistic analyses revealed that three common polymorphisms, rs2982510, rs2294752, and rs446738, were putatively associated with the increased susceptibility to AIA (p = .003, p(corr) = .004, OR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.09-0.62 for rs2982510 and rs2294752; p = .008, p(corr) = .03, OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.24-0.80 for rs446738, in the recessive model). In addition, rs2982510 and rs2294752 were significantly associated with the fall of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV\u2081) by aspirin provocation (p = .001, p(corr) = .04 in the recessive model for both SNPs).

Stratified analyses of association between the selected SNPs and CRS adjusted for gender demonstrated that rs13156068 (CC genotype: P=0.010, OR=0.289) and rs764917 (CC genotype: P=0.040, OR=0.509) were significantly protective against CRS, whereas rs6886755 (GT genotype: P=0.040, OR=0.509) presented a risk among females. In contrast, rs764917 (CA genotype: P=0.033, OR=1.553) presented risk for CRS in males. Furthermore, SNPs rs252706 (AA genotype: P=0.012, OR=0.552) and rs764917 (CA genotype: P=0.001, OR=0.182) displayed protective roles among CRSwNP, but not CRSsNP, subjects.

Peripheral blood samples were used for genotyping of polymorphisms in MTHFR, DPD, GSTP1, MDR1, TYMS, ERCC1, XRCC1, and ERCC2 genes by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique and DNA sequencing. The primary end point of the study was to investigate the association of each genetic polymorphism with progression-free survival and overall survival (OS). Favorable genotypes from polymorphisms in ERCC1 codon 118C/C [hazard ratio (HR)=0.061, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.014-0.274, P<0.001] and XRCC1 codon 399G/G (HR=0.306, 95% CI: 0.103-0.905, P=0.032) that are associated with progression-free survival were identified.

{"abstract": "This meta-analysis assessed the pooled effect of each genetic variant reproducibly associated with diabetic nephropathy. PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched for articles assessing the association between genes and diabetic nephropathy. All genetic variants statistically associated with diabetic nephropathy in an initial study, then independently reproduced in at least one additional study, were selected. Subsequently, all studies assessing these variants were included. The association between these variants and diabetic nephropathy (defined as macroalbuminuria/proteinuria or end-stage renal disease [ESRD]) was calculated at the allele level and the main measure of effect was a pooled odds ratio. Pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed, stratifying for type 1/type 2 diabetes mellitus, proteinuria/ESRD and ethnic group. The literature search yielded 3,455 citations, of which 671 were genetic association studies investigating diabetic nephropathy. We identified 34 replicated genetic variants. Of these, 21 remained significantly associated with diabetic nephropathy in a random-effects meta-analysis. These variants were in or near the following genes: ACE, AKR1B1 (two variants), APOC1, APOE, EPO, NOS3 (two variants), HSPG2, VEGFA, FRMD3 (two variants), CARS (two variants), UNC13B, CPVL and CHN2, and GREM1, plus four variants not near genes. The odds ratios of associated genetic variants ranged from 0.48 to 1.70. Additional variants were detected in subgroup analyses: ELMO1 (Asians), CCR5 (Asians) and CNDP1 (type 2 diabetes).

Besides the phenotypes reported previously (C, AC and BC), a relatively infrequent double-banded phenotype (tentatively named A'C) was observed. Moreover, a homozygous variant (A) and a heterozygous \"double\" variant (AB) were observed. The estimated frequencies for the common allele, C2c(= C2(1)), and the variant alleles, C2A, C2B(= C2(2)) and C2A' were 0.939, 0.034, 0.022, and 0.006, respectively. The results of further typing for HLA-A, -B, -C specificities indicated the presence of significant associations of C2A with HLA-B15 and with A26, and of C2B with HLA-Bw61. These findings support our previous observation that in Japanese there are allelic combinations showing linkage disequilibrium between C2 and HLA loci which are different from those in Caucasians, and that the C2 structural locus is more closely linked to HLA-B than to HLA-A. C2 hemolytic activities of each phenotypes were assayed. The mean activity of type AC sera was significantly higher than that of type C or type BC, while there were no differences in the activities among the types C, BC or A'C.

In total, 160 prostate cancer patients and 205 age-matched male controls were studied between December 2000 and February 2003. No significant associations were found between the ApaI and TaqI polymorphisms and the risk of prostate cancer. However, the control group was found to have a significantly higher frequency of the BsmI 'BB' and 'Bb' genotypes (15.6%) than prostate cancer patients (8.1%).

CaM plays an important role in maintaining cartilage phenotype. Three genes, CALM1, CALM2, and CALM3, encode completely identical CaM proteins. In the present study, we investigated the susceptibility of these three genes for hip OA. Expression analyses revealed that CALM2 was most abundantly expressed in articular chondrocytes and OA cartilage. We then identified sequence polymorphisms in the CALM2 region and analyzed their associations with hip OA in a Japanese population. None of the polymorphisms was significantly associated with hip OA, but when the population was stratified according to acetabular dysplasia status, two SNPs located in intron 1 were found to be significantly associated in a subpopulation of the hip OA patients without acetabular dysplasia (P\u00a0=\u00a00.036 and 0.031, respectively).

The concentration/dose (C/D) ratio of tacrolimus in patients carrying graft liver with CYP3A4*1/*1 was significantly higher during 7\u2009d after surgery than in that with CYP3A4*1/*1G (214 vs. 157 [ng/mL]/[mg/kg/day], p<0.01). After postoperative day 8, no significant difference was observed among CYP3A4*1G genotypes in the graft liver.

The former was associated with a predisposition to osteoporosis and the latter with bone mineral density. To further elucidate the importance of these polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, we examined their association with the incidence of vertebral fracture. DNA extracted from the renal cortex of 2427 consecutive Japanese autopsies (1331 men, mean age: 79 years; 1096 women, mean age: 82 years) were examined in this study. The presence or absence of vertebral fracture during each subject's lifetime was determined by a thorough examination of the clinical records, as well as autopsy reports. After adjustments for sex and age at autopsy, logistic regression analysis revealed that homozygotes for the risk alleles of rs7605378 (A-allele) or rs12673629 (A-allele) possess an increased risk of vertebral fracture. The subjects simultaneously homozygous for both the risk alleles of rs7605378 (AA genotype) and rs12673629 (AA genotype) showed significantly higher risk of vertebral fracture (odds ratio 2.401, 95% confidence interval 1.305-4.416, P = 0.0048) than those who had at least one non-risk allele of either rs7605378 (AC/CC genotypes) or rs12673629 (AG/GG genotypes).

{"abstract": "It has already been a decade and a half since the discovery of adiponectin and its role as an insulin sensitizer and only 7 years since its receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, were described. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a DNA sequence variation that affects only one nucleotide; it may vary from one population to another with different predisposing factors to diseases and other ailments. Once some of the effects of adiponectin and its receptors were known, it was not long until an effort was made to find the associations between specific SNPs of the genes of this hormone and its receptors as genetic risk factors for insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome, although these genes were investigated as possible candidates related to the development of these metabolic disorders. All of these possible associations were studied in different populations from France, Finland, the United Kingdom, North America, and Japan, showing hardly concluding results, and because of that it is highly controversial to directly associate one of the genes mentioned above to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome. All of these inconsistencies lead to a review that summarizes the SNPs of the genes of adiponectin, AdipoR1, and AdipoR2 that are mostly related to insulin resistance syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome, although presenting the possible factors that should be taken into account to homogenize the results obtained until now.

However, previous studies have failed to include subjects with antisocial personality disorder without alcoholism even though there is a high comorbidity between antisocial personality disorder and alcoholism. Consequently, the finding of an association between the MAO-A gene and alcoholism or antisocial personality disorder seems tenuous. In Taiwan, about 70% of the Han Chinese population have the ADH2*2 allele and 50% show ALDH2*1/*2 or ALDH2*2/*2 genotypes, which offer protection against drinking behavior and the risk of developing alcoholism. Thus, it is possible to recruit individuals with antisocial personality disorder but without alcoholism in Taiwan. Therefore, association studies of alcoholism or antisocial personality disorder in Chinese may be more reliable if pure antisocial alcoholics, pure antisocial personality disorders, and normal controls as MAO-A gene are examined. In this study, the associations among antisocial alcoholism, antisocial personality disorder, and the uVNTR and EcoRV polymorphisms of the MAO-A gene, both individually and as a haplotype, were investigated among male adults recruited from jails in Taipei.

A total of 931 patients with nonfamilial AF, 663 non-AF heart disease patients and 727 healthy subjects were selected. 10 tagSNPs (tSNPs) (ACE gene rs8066114, AGT gene rs7539020, rs3789678, rs2478544, rs11568023, rs2478523, rs4762, rs699 and CYP11B2 rs3802230, rs3097) were chosen and genotyped in our study. Single-locus analysis and haplotype analysis were used in this study. In single-locus analysis, we found rs11568023 and rs3789678 in AGT gene were associated with nonfamilial AF in Chinese Han population. AF risk was associated with rs3789678 between the AF group and control groups. Under dominant model, the significant AF risk was observed in rs3789678 between the AF group and non AF heart control group; And the protective effect was found in rs11568023, compared with the non-AF heart disease control group. In multilocus haplotype analysis, the association between frequencies of the haplotypes and AF risk was showed in AGT gene (rs7539020-rs3789678), compared 'TT' haplotype with the common 'TC' haplotype, adjusted for age, gender, LVEF, LVEDD, LAD and frequency of hypertension and diabetes. The diplotype with 'TC', carrying rs3789678-C-allele, was associated with reduced risk of AF between the AF group and the healthy control group. The diplotype with 'TT' haplotype in the same block, carrying rs3789678-T-allele, was associated with increased risk of AF. Via a large-scale case-control study, we found that rs3789678 site was potential susceptible locus of AF whereas rs11568023 was protective factor.", "title": "Polymorphisms of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system gene in chinese han patients with nonfamilial atrial fibrillation.", "pmid": "25723521", "id": "676"},

Many studies have reported the relation of FCRL gene family with SLE and RA. We hypothesized that FCRL4 may be a key gene for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) development. To test this hypothesis, we screened FCRL4 polymorphisms in the Chinese Han population. Five tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs14335, rs849826, rs10489674, rs2778003, and rs2777963, were selected. Using a case-control study, five tag SNPs, which captured the majority of known common variation within FCRL4 gene, were selected and genotyped by Multiplex Snapshot technique. We analyzed 299 patients and 300 controls from China. The genotype analysis demonstrated that one of the FCRL4 tag SNPs rs2777963 TT genotype may be a risk factor of AS (\u03c7(2) = 7.374, p = 0.024).

We examined the association between genetic polymorphism and clinical course/outcome in severely septic patients. The study included 125 patients with severe sepsis/septic shock (SS) and 104 non-sepsis patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Chiba University Hospital between October 2001 and September 2008 (discovery cohort) and 268 SS patients and 454 non-sepsis patients who were admitted to ICUs of five Japanese institutions including Chiba University Hospital between October 2008 and September 2012 (multi-center validation cohort). Three hundred forty seven healthy volunteers who consented to this study were also included. Genotyping was performed for a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the coding region of IRGM, IRGM(+313) (rs10065172). Lipopolysaccharide challenge of whole blood from randomly selected healthy volunteers (n\u200a=\u200a70) was performed for comparison of IRGM mRNA expression among different genotypes. No significant difference in genotypic distributions (CC/CT/TT) at the IRGM(+313) locus was observed among the three subject groups (SS, non-sepsis, and healthy volunteers) in either cohort. When mortality were compared, no significant difference was observed in the non-sepsis group, while TT homozygotes exhibited a significantly higher mortality than the CC+CT genotype category in the SS group for both cohorts (P\u200a=\u200a0.043, 0.037). Lipopolysaccharide challenge to whole blood showed a significant suppression of IRGM mRNA expression in TT compared with the CC+CT genotype category (P\u200a=\u200a0.019).

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a major inducer of angiogenesis, has been correlated with several pathological conditions, from inflammation to ischemic processes. A number of polymorphisms in the VEGF gene have been described as being associated with several diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, prostate cancer and breast cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of VEGF gene polymorphisms with ONFH in a case--control study. Three polymorphisms (-2578C>A, -634G>C and +936C>T) in VEGF were genotyped in 317 ONFH patients and 497 control subjects, using the TaqMan 5' allelic discrimination assay. We performed the association analysis of genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes with ONFH.

We succeeded in cloning human Ob-R cDNA and revealed 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Lys109Arg, Arg223Gln, Ser343Ser, Ser492Thr, Lys656Asn, Ala976Asp, and Pro1019Pro) in the coding region of Ob-Rb. Although these 7 SNPs were not associated with an obese phenotype, several studies have reported that some of them were associated with impaired glucose metabolism. To clarify whether the Arg223Gln and A3057G (Pro1019Pro) polymorphisms influence glucose metabolism in Japanese, 696 Japanese men were genotyped. Individually, the Arg223Gln and the A3057G polymorphisms were not associated with the glucose metabolic parameters. No associations were found between haplotype and clinical parameters.

Nine studies including 1990 cases and 2074 controls were selected. Data were extracted and further analyzed using systematic meta-analyses. Results showed that no significant differences of oral cancer risk were found between individuals carrying homozygote Arg/Arg genotype and those carrying Pro/Pro genotype (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.78-1.19). Likewise, no evidence indicated that individuals with Arg/Arg genotype have a significant risk of oral cancer compared with those with a combined Pro genotype (Arg/Pro+Pro/Pro) (OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.85-1.12).

Thus, we sought to evaluate whether polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and CYP2R1 genes are associated with mite-sensitized persistent allergic rhinitis (PER) in a Han Chinese population. A hospital-based case-control study consisting of 519 patients with mite-sensitized PER and 447 healthy controls was conducted. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VDR and CYP2R1 were selected for genotyping. The genotype and allele frequencies of rs9729, rs2228570, rs1544410, and rs731236 in VDR as well as rs2060793 in CYP2R1 were not significantly associated with susceptibility to mite-sensitized PER. After stratification analyses, however, both the CT and CT/TT genotypes of rs2228570 in VDR exhibited a significantly decreased risk (CT: adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.58, 95% confidence intervals (CI)=0.37-0.91; adjusted OR=0.61, 95% CI=0.40-0.93) of mite-sensitized PER, while the AA genotype of rs2060793 in CYP2R1 exhibited a significantly increased risk (adjusted OR=1.85, 95% CI=1.03-3.34) of PER in the age subgroup of <16 years old.

{"abstract": "Fifty-one patients with autoimmune hepatitis have been studied for HLA association by conventional serology and also by modified polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) genotyping. HLA-DR4 was significantly associated with autoimmune hepatitis (46 of 51 patients, 90.2%). DNA typing of the DRB1 gene for 43 DR4-positive patients by using the PCR-RFLP technique revealed that of 43 patients, 33 had DRB1*0405 (Dw15), five had DRB1*0406 (DwKT2), four had DRB1*0403 (Dw13a), two had DRB1*0401 (Dw4), two of 43 had DRB1*0407 (Dw13b) and one had DRB1*0408 (Dw14b). Thus, there was no significant difference in Dw frequencies between DR4-positive patients and DR4-positive healthy subjects. These findings suggest that the DR4-specific sequence (Val 11 and His 13 at amino acid positions 11 and 13, respectively), but not particular Dw-associated DR4 sequence, in the first domain of the DRB1 chain contributes to susceptibility to autoimmune hepatitis among Japanese. Interestingly, all five of the DR4-negative patients had the DR2 specificity (DRB1*1502 or 1601).

{"abstract": "In a candidate gene association study, we found that SMAD2 promoter alleles and haplotypes were significantly associated with bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine and various proximal femur sites. Our results suggest that SMAD2 polymorphisms may be one of genetic determinants of BMD in postmenopausal women. SMAD2, which is the specific intracellular transducer of TGF-\u00df, is thought to participate in bone metabolism by playing a critical role in the development and function of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. We performed association analyses of the genetic variation in SMAD2 to ascertain the contribution of this gene to BMD and risk of osteoporotic fracture. We selected three SMAD2 promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on heterozygosity and validation status. Postmenopausal Korean women (n\u2009=\u20091,329) were genotyped for these SNPs, and their BMD and risk of fractures were assessed. BMD at the lumbar spine and proximal femur was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. P values were corrected for multiple testing by the effective number of independent marker loci (P (cor)). We found that SMAD2 -35302C>T, -34952A>G, and ht2 were significantly associated with BMD at both the lumbar spine and femur neck (P (cor)\u2009=\u20090.020-0.046), whereas SMAD2 -36201A>G and ht1 affected the femur neck BMD (P (cor)\u2009=\u20090.018-0.031). The genetic effects of these three polymorphisms on BMD at the lumbar spine and femur neck were risk-allele dependent in additive model. The three polymorphisms and two hts were also significantly associated with BMD at other proximal femur sites, such as the total femur, trochanter, and femur shaft (P (cor)\u2009=\u20090.001-0.046). However, none of the polymorphisms or hts was associated with an increased risk of fracture.

{"abstract": "Esophageal cancer (EC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide with 5-year survival rate less than 10%. However, there is a lack of specific genetic markers that could help better understanding the mechanisms of esophageal carcinogenesis, improving the detection rate of EC, and distinguishing histological types. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) as an inducible enzyme in cancer development and progression is involved in esophageal carcinogenesis. A large number of studies have demonstrated a strong association between COX-2 polymorphisms and EC risk. However, the overall results are still controversial. This controversy may be partly due to the mix-up of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and adenocarcinoma (EAC). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between COX-2 polymorphisms and susceptibility to ESCC or EAC by conducting a meta-analysis. Seven studies were retrieved reporting a total of 1450 ESCC patients, 523 EAC patients, and 2663 cancer-free control subjects. Five COX-2 polymorphisms were addressed, including -765G>C (rs20417), -1195G>A (rs689465), -1290A>G (rs689466), -8473T>C (rs5275) and -1759G>A (rs3218625). Meta-analysis results showed that the -765C allele is significantly associated with the susceptibility to both ESCC and EAC especially in Asian populations. In addition, there was a significant association between the -8473C allele and the susceptibility to EAC in Caucasian populations. In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that the -765C allele of the COX-2 gene might be a potential risk factor for both ESCC and EAC especially in Asian populations, while the -8473C allele might be a risk factor for EAC in Caucasian populations.", "title": "Cyclooxygenase-2 polymorphisms and susceptibility to esophageal cancer: a meta-analysis.", "pmid": "21304218", "id": "695"},
{"abstract": "This cross-sectional study analyzed the association of serum irisin concentrations with cardiorespiratory fitness levels and common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FNDC5 gene and examined the relationships between cardiorespiratory fitness levels, common SNPs in FNDC5, and glucose metabolism. Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed by measuring peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) and serum irisin levels by ELISA in 163 Japanese men (age, 21-79years). Subjects were divided into low- and high-fitness groups within each age group according to the median VO2peak value. Common SNPs (rs3480 and rs16835198) of the FNDC5 gene were genotyped with the TaqMan assay. Glucose metabolism was evaluated by measuring HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin levels, and HOMA-IR. Serum irisin levels were negatively correlated with age (p<0.001) and not associated with the VO2peak or HOMA-IR. In the low-fitness group, SNP analysis revealed that subjects with the rs3480 AG and GG genotypes had higher levels of insulin and HOMA-IR than those with the AA genotype (p<0.01; no significant difference was observed in the high-fitness group). The GG genotypes of rs16835198 were associated with increased HbA1c and FPG in the low-fitness group only (p<0.05). SNPs and both fitness groups were not associated with serum irisin levels. In Japanese men, cardiorespiratory fitness levels and common SNPs in FNDC5 are not associated with circulating irisin levels, whereas high cardiorespiratory fitness abolishes the association between the rs3480 and rs16835198 SNPs and glucose metabolism independent of serum irisin levels.", "title": "Common single nucleotide polymorphisms in the FNDC5 gene are associated with glucose metabolism but do not affect serum irisin levels in Japanese men with low fitness levels.", "pmid": "24559842", "id": "696"},

Cytogenetic analysis has been used to identify the molecular background of haematological malignancies. To compare the distribution of chromosomal abnormalities of T-ALL and T-LBL, large series of cytogenetic data are required, but are absent in T-LBL in contrast to the abundant data in T-ALL. Among 111 T-LBL cases in our clinical trial, we obtained complete cytogenetic data from 56 patients. The comparison between our cytogenetic findings and those from three published T-LBL studies revealed no significant difference. However, meta-analysis showed that translocations involving chromosome region 9q34 were significantly more common in T-LBL than in T-ALL. In particular, four out of the 92 T-LBL cases, but none of the 523 paediatric T-ALL cases, showed translocation t(9;17)(q34;q22-23) (P=0\u00b70004).

{"abstract": "Individual alleles identified by candidate gene analysis have been shown to profoundly influence certain complex behavioral syndromes including vulnerability to alcoholism. The alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase polymorphisms, ADH2(2) and ALDH2(2), respectively, are associated with lower vulnerability to alcoholism both in the Orient and also in North America among populations of Taiwanese and Koreans who have immigrated there. Protein structural variants have recently been identified for a series of genes involved in dopamine and serotonin function. Three dopamine receptors exhibit such structural variants, and these include the DRD2 dopamine receptor, which has three relatively rare amino acid substitutions. Structural polymorphisms were detected in five serotonin receptors (5HT1A, 5HT1Db, 5HT2A, 5HT2C, and 5HT7). Association studies between neurotransmitter gene variants and alcoholism are at an earlier stage than with ADH2(2)/ALDH2(2), but results are thus far negative (dopamine DRD4 receptor), equivocal (dopamine DRD2 receptor), or preliminary (tryptophan hydroxylase, 5HT2C and 5HT1Db).", "title": "Candidate genes in alcoholism.", "pmid": "8612062", "id": "698"},

No association was found between the MspI RFLP in the CYP1A1 gene and any of these variables. This is in contrast to the results of an earlier report describing an association between the rare genotype m2m2 and susceptibility to lung cancer in a Japanese population; but another study in Norway found no such association. It is evident that, in the Nordic population, MspI polymorphism in the CYP1A1 gene does not indicate individual susceptibility to lung cancer. We also studied a new point mutation which has recently been closely linked to the MspI restriction site polymorphism in a Japanese study population. This mutation results in an isoleucine-valine amino acid replacement in the heme binding region of human CYP1A1.

{"abstract": "Febrile convulsions (FCs) represent the majority of childhood seizures, and patients have a genetic predisposition to their development. The genetic susceptibility to FCs seems to involve multiple genes in most instances. Recent studies provided evidence that mutations in SCN1A represent the most frequent cause of generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus an autosomal-dominant epilepsy syndrome. SCN1A mutations alter channel inactivation, resulting in persistent inward sodium current. It is not known if polymorphisms in those genes involved in familial epilepsies also contribute to the pathogenesis of FCs. By performing an association study, we used single nucleotide polymorphisms to investigate the distribution of genotypes of SCN1A in patients with FCs. A total of 104 Taiwanese children with FCs and 83 normal control subjects were included in the study. Polymerase chain reaction was used to identify the A/G polymorphism of the SCN1A gene. The results showed that genotypes and allelic frequencies for the SCN1A gene polymorphisms in both groups were not significantly different.

Overall, the results showed null significant association between LEP G2548A, LEPR Q223R, LEPR Lys109Arg, or PON1 Q192R polymorphism and breast cancer risk; however, PON1 L55M was significantly associated with breast cancer risk overall (MM vs. LL: OR\u2009=\u20092.16; 95% CI, 1.76-2.66). For LEPR Q223R polymorphism, further subgroup analysis suggested that the association was only statistically significant in East Asians (OR\u2009=\u20090.50; 95% CI, 0.36-0.70) but not in Caucasians (OR\u2009=\u20091.06; 95% CI, 0.77-1.45) or Africans (OR\u2009=\u20091.30; 95% CI, 0.83-2.03).

{"abstract": "The enhancer of zeste 2 (EZH2) gene encodes the histone methyltransferase that is the catalytic component of the polycomb repressive complex-2, which initiates epigenetic silencing of genes. The expression level of EZH2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is highly correlated with tumor progression; however, it has not been determined if specific EZH2 genetic variants are associated with the risk of HCC. This study investigated the potential associations of EZH2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms with HCC susceptibility and its clinicopathologic characteristics. A total of 220 HCC patients and 552 cancer-free controls were analyzed for four EZH2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs6950683, rs2302427, rs3757441, and rs41277434) using real-time PCR genotyping. After adjusting for other co-variants, the individuals carrying at least one C allele at EZH2 rs6950683 and rs3757441 had a 0.611-fold and a 0.660-fold lower risk of developing HCC than did wild-type (TT) carriers, respectively. The CCCA or CCTA haplotype among the four EZH2 sites (rs6950683, rs2302427, rs3757441, and rs41277434), respectively, was also associated with a reduced risk of HCC. Furthermore, HCC patients who carried at least one C allele at rs6950683 or rs3757441 had a higher lymph-node-metastasis risk but a lower liver-cirrhosis risk than did patients carrying the wild-type allele. The rs6950683 and rs3757441 polymorphic genotypes of EZH2 might contribute to the prediction of susceptibility to and pathological development of HCC.

Eligible studies were identified for the period up to Apr 2012. Meta-analyses evaluating the association of CYP1A1 Ile462Val variation with acute leukemia were carried out. Subgroup analyses on ethnicity, clinical types and source of controls were further performed. A total of thirteen publications including fourteen case-control studies with 2164 cases and 4160 controls were selected for analysis. The overall data indicated a significant association of CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism with acute leukemia risk (Val/Val vs Ile/Ile OR\u200a=\u200a1.49; 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.11-1.98; dominant model: OR\u200a=\u200a1.26; 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.05-1.51; recessive model: OR\u200a=\u200a1.38; 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.04-1.83).

To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, we performed a meta-analysis based on 8 studies. A comprehensive search was conducted to examine all the eligible studies of TNF-\u03b1 -308 G>A polymorphism and cervical cancer risk. We used odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the strength of the association. Eight studies regarding TNF-\u03b1 -308 G>A polymorphism status including 2298 cases and 1903 controls were collected.

The present study aimed to determine the di-allelic polymorphisms of TNF gene and their association with H. pylori infection and gastroduodenal diseases in Chinese population of Han nationality. Two hundred and ten patients with gastroduodenal diseases (73 chronic gastritis, 78 duodenal ulcer, and 59 noncardia gastric cancer) and 264 healthy controls were genotyped by the PCR-RFLP method for TNF-alpha 308, lymphotoxin-alpha (LT-alpha) NcoI, and AspHI gene polymorphisms.

{"abstract": "Although many single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) studies have reported an association of atopy, allergic diseases and total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, almost all of these studies sought risk factors for the onset of these allergic diseases. Furthermore, many studies have analyzed a single gene and hardly any have analyzed environmental factors. In these analyses, the results could be masked and the effects of other genes and environmental factors may be decreased. Here, we described the correlation between four genes [interleukin (IL)-4 (C-590T), IL-4 receptor (A1652G), FCER1B (G6842A) and STAT6 (G2964A)] in connection with IgE production; the role of IL-10 (C-627A) as a regulatory cytokine of allergy; and the severity of food allergy (FA) and atopic eczema (AE) in 220 Japanese allergic children. In addition to these SNPs, environmental factors, i.e., patient's attitude, indoor environment, and so on, were also investigated in this study. Our study was retrospective, and the correlation was analyzed by our defined clinical scores divided into three terms: worst symptoms, recent symptoms and general amelioration at the most recent examination during the disease course. Our results indicated that IL-10 AA, the genotype with lower IL-10 production, is associated with higher IgE levels in the serum (p < 0.0001, estimate; 0.912). Marginal liver abnormalities were observed in the subject group with both FA and AE (p < 0.1191, estimate; 0.1490). Our defined clinical scores enabled evaluation of various aspects of disease severity.

{"abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease affected by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Several association studies have suggested that cellular immune response is vital for controlling and preventing of tuberculosis infection. Low molecular weight polypeptides (LMPs) and transporters with antigen processing (TAPs) are the main molecules in the processing and presentation pathway for intracellular antigens. This study was performed to elucidate whether these antigen-processing genes (LMP/TAP) polymorphisms could be associated with the risk of tuberculosis infection in China. We recruited 205 active pulmonary tuberculosis patients and 217 normal controls from Li population for this study. Four polymorphisms of LMP/TAP genes were determined by PCR-RFLP assay and haplotypes were constructed by software PHASE 1.0. Of the total four polymorphisms, genotype frequencies of LMP7 AA homozygote and CA heterozygote were significantly greater among cases compared to controls, with odds ratio of 3.77 (95% CI: 1.60-8.89; P = 0.002) and 2.97 (95% CI: 1.80-4.90; P<0.0001), respectively.

However, uncertainty regarding the risk for neutropenia and hepatotoxicity deters its using. Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) is the key enzyme in the metabolism of thiopurine. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of TPMT polymorphisms and activity with azathioprine (AZA)-related adverse events and clinical efficacy in Chinese Han patients with IBD. Fifty-two Han IBD patients treated with AZA were assessed for TPMT 2, 3A, 3B, and 3C, and for adverse events. Then, using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, TPMT activity was measured in 13 patients to analyze its correlation with AZA-related toxicity and clinical efficacy. Of the 52 patients, five experienced myelotoxicity and one experienced hepatotoxicity during treatment. No TPMT 2, 3A, 3B or 3C polymorphisms were detected in any of the 52 patients. In the 13 patients with TPMT activity measurement, TPMT activity ranged from 7.2 to 28.8 U/ml packed red blood cells (pRBCs). Among the 5 patients who suffered from myelotoxicity, 3 were affected in the early stage of AZA therapy. In these 3 patients, TPMT levels were significantly lower than those in patients without myelotoxicity, which reached statistical significance ((9.3 \u00b1 2.1) U/ml pRBC vs. (18.0 \u00b1 6.2) U/ml pRBC; P = 0.046).

This investigation was conducted to assess if there was an association between the uteroglobin G38A gene polymorphism and IgAN risk using meta-analysis. The relevant literatures were identified from PubMed, and Cochrane Library on 10 October 2013, and eligible studies were included and synthesized. Seven reports were recruited into this meta-analysis for the association of the uteroglobin G38A gene polymorphism with IgAN risk. In overall population, the A allele and AA genotype were not associated with IgAN risk. Furthermore, the GG genotype was also not associated with IgAN risk in overall population. Interestingly, the association of uteroglobin G38A gene polymorphism with IgAN risk was also not found in Asians and in Caucasians. In the sensitivity analysis, according to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test, according to the control source from healthy, the genotyping methods using PCR-RFLP, PCR-SSCP, no association of the uteroglobin G38A gene polymorphism with IgAN risk was found and the results were similar to those in non-sensitivity analysis.

{"abstract": "In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 5% of cases are familial, and most of the remaining cases are sporadic. In familial ALS, many causative genes have been identified during the last 20 years of the golden age of genetics. In particular, the recent discovery of a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) has had a large impact on ALS research, as this mutation is the most frequent cause of familial ALS in Europe and the US. However, the relative rarity of this mutation in Japan and Asia suggests the need to identify further other causative genes of familial ALS. In this regard, the advent of next-generation sequencing technology is expected to accelerate the identification of novel genes. In addition, next-generation sequencing will supersede Sanger sequencing in the molecular diagnosis of familial ALS. A number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted to identify the disease-susceptibility genes of sporadic ALS. In 1,305 Japanese ALS samples, the ZNF512B gene was associated with susceptibility to ALS. This gene has been shown to be one of the prognostic factors in sporadic ALS. Although GWAS that are based on the 'common disease-common variants hypothesis' have successfully revealed many disease-susceptibility genes, including ZNF512B, in sporadic ALS, the odds ratios associated with these risk alleles are generally low. The next challenge in ALS research is to use next-generation sequencing techniques to identify disease-relevant alleles with large effect sizes based on the 'common disease-multiple rare variants hypothesis'.", "title": "[Personal genome analysis in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis].", "pmid": "23475517", "id": "728"},

We have performed a large-scale association study to identify gene polymorphisms for reliable assessment of the genetic risk of myocardial infarction. The study population comprised 3,483 unrelated Japanese individuals (1,913 men; 1,570 women), including 1,192 subjects with myocardial infarction and 2,291 controls. The genotypes for 164 polymorphisms of 137 candidate genes were determined with an oligonucleotide ligation assay based on analysis of fluorescent microspheres with suspension array technology. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and the prevalence of smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia revealed that the 677C-->T (Ala222Val) polymorphism of MTHFR, the 1595C-->G (Ser447Stop) polymorphism of LPL, and the -108/3G-->4G polymorphism of IPF1 were significantly associated with the prevalence of myocardial infarction. A stepwise forward selection procedure demonstrated that IPF1, MTHFR, and LPL genotypes significantly affected the prevalence of myocardial infarction. Combined genotype analysis of these polymorphisms yielded a maximum odds ratio of 2.54 for the combined genotype of TT for MTHFR, CC for LPL, and 3G3G for IPF1. The genotypes for MTHFR, LPL, and IPF1 may prove reliable for assessment of genetic risk for myocardial infarction.

Furthermore, the Fc receptor-like 3 (FCRL3) gene was previously found to be susceptible for a certain inflammatory demyelinating diseases (such as multiple sclerosis). The present study, therefore, was aimed to explore the possible association of FCRL3 gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to NMO in a Chinese Han population. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FCRL3 were, respectively, genotyped in 132 NMO patients and 264 healthy controls via PCR assay. Moreover, the t-test and the chi-square test were used to estimate the association between genetic mutations of FCRL3 and the risk of NMO with Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software (Version 9.0). It was demonstrated that FCRL3_3, 5, 6 and 8, SNPs were remarkably associated with susceptibility to NMO in both allelic [OR\u200a=\u200a1.50 (95% CI: 1.11-2.03, P\u200a=\u200a0.008), OR\u200a=\u200a1.44 (1.07-1.94, P\u200a=\u200a0.015), OR\u200a=\u200a1.45 (1.08-1.95, P\u200a=\u200a0.014), and OR\u200a=\u200a2.01 (1.13-3.60, P\u200a=\u200a0.016)] and homozygous models [OR\u200a=\u200a2.19 (95% CI: 1.19-3.99, P\u200a=\u200a0.010), OR\u200a=\u200a2.09 (1.15-3.80, P\u200a=\u200a0.014), OR\u200a=\u200a2.04 (1.13-3.67, P\u200a=\u200a0.016), and OR\u200a=\u200a5.33 (1.02-27.9, P\u200a=\u200a0.027)].

Population genetic variation in five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5' region of the IL-4 gene was assessed in five racial groups. Neutrality tests reveal that the populations are evolving in accord with the infinite-sites model. However, coalescent simulations suggest greater haplotype diversity among African Americans than expected. This increased variation is presumably attributable to recombination or gene conversion. Genetic epidemiological analyses were conducted among European American and African American participants enrolled in five USA-based HIV-1/AIDS cohorts.

BMD of the left humerus, right femoral neck, lumbar spine and total body was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The relation between the allelic variants and bone density was analyzed as presence or absence of the H allele. Presence of the H allele was found to be related to a lower BMD of the humerus (0.97 vs 1.02, p = 0.03). There was also a strong tendency towards significance at the femoral neck (p = 0.06) and total body (p = 0.11). Using a multiple linear regression and including physical activity, weight, height and years since menarche, presence of the H allele was found to be an independent predictor of humerus BMD (beta = -0.21, p < 0.05) and femoral neck BMD (beta = -0.23, p < 0.01). Using logistic regression, presence of the H allele was also independently associated with a 4.5 times increased risk of osteopenia (p = 0.03) in the whole group. Osteopenia was defined as at least 1 SD lower bone density than the mean for the whole group of at least one of the BMD sites measured.

Furthermore, the combined IVS12-6CC and IVS10+12AA genotypes also significantly increased the risk of GC (OR=2.12, 95% CI: 1.22-3.66). Statistically significant interactions were observed between: IVS10+12G>A and drinking, high pickled food or fried food intake (OR=2.32; 95% CI: 1.43-3.78, OR=2.55; 95% CI: 1.48-4.21 and OR=2.88; 95% CI: 1.70-4.94, respectively); and IVS12-6T>C and high pickled food intake or fried food intake (OR=2.65; 95% CI: 1.62-4.47 and OR=2.48; 95% CI: 1.42-4.13, respectively). The IVS10+12G>A and IVS12-6T>C polymorphisms in MSH2 gene appear to be associated with risk of GC in this Chinese population.

{"abstract": "There is growing evidence that genetic variants have an impact on the pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysm (IA). Recently, the genetic locus around the elastin gene (7q11) has been identified as linked to IA in a Japanese population. Our aim was to confirm these results in Caucasian populations. We conducted a case-control study in 120 Caucasian patients with IA and 172 controls to investigate 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and various haplotypes within the elastin gene, which were frequently found and associated with the phenotype in the Japanese populations. Real-time PCR and melting curve analysis were used for the detection of genotypes. Allele frequencies and genotypes were equally distributed between Caucasian cases and controls. We failed to identify haplotypes that are associated with the phenotype in our population, which is in contrast to the Japanese study. However, allele frequencies in control populations differ between Caucasians and Japanese. We found no association between SNPs and haplotypes of the elastin gene and the occurrence of IA in our Caucasian populations. However, our data provide strong evidence for racial/ethnic differences in the association of SNP and specific haplotypes of the elastin gene with the phenotype.

{"abstract": "Copy number variation (CNV) is a type of genetic variation which may have important roles in phenotypic variability and disease susceptibility. To hunt for genetic variants underlying human height variation, we performed a genome wide CNV association study for human height in 618 Chinese unrelated subjects using Affymetrix 500K array set. After adjusting for age and sex, we found that four CNVs at 6p21.3, 8p23.3-23.2, 9p23 and 16p12.1 were associated with human height (with borderline significant p value: 0.013, 0.011, 0.024, 0.049; respectively). However, after multiple tests correction, none of them was associated with human height. We observed that the gain of copy number (more than 2 copies) at 8p23.3-23.2 was associated with lower height (normal copy number vs. gain of copy number: 161.2 cm vs. 153.7 cm, p = 0.011), which accounted for 0.9% of height variation. Loss of copy number (less than 2 copies) at 6p21.3 was associated with 0.8% lower height (loss of copy number vs. normal copy number: 154.5 cm vs. 161.1 cm, p = 0.013). Since no important genes influencing height located in CNVs at loci of 8p23.3-23.2 and 6p21.3, the two CNVs may cause the structural rearrangements of neighbored important candidate genes, thus regulates the variation of height.

Genomic DNA was prepared from 32 unrelated patients with microphthalmia (nine probands) and uveal coloboma (23 probands). Cycle sequencing was used to detect sequence variations in ten genes, including BMP4, VSX2, CRYBA4, GDF6, OTX2, RAX, SIX3, SIX6, SOX2, and LRP6. Variations were further evaluated in 96 unrelated controls by using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) or heteroduplex-single strand conformation polymorphism (HA-SSCP) analysis. In the ten genes, a novel c.751C>T (p.H251Y) in BMP4 was detected in a patient with bilateral microphthalmia and unilateral cataract. The c.751C>T variation is also present in his healthy brother (and possibly one of the normal parents). In addition, a novel c.608G>A (p.R203Q) in SIX6 was identified in an internal control for optimizing experimental conditions. The internal control was from a girl with typical aniridia and an identified c.718C>T (p.R240X) mutation in PAX6, suggesting the c.608G>A variation in SIX6 was unlikely to play a role in her ocular phenotype. The c.751C>T in BMP4 and the c.608G>A in SIX6 were not present in the 96 normal controls. In addition, 16 nucleotide substitutions, including eight known SNPs and eight new synonymous changes, were detected. Although the genetic etiology for microphthalmia and/or coloboma is still elusive, rare variations in the related genes, such as c.608 G>A in SIX6 and c.751C>T in BMP4, may not be causative.

The genotypes of 184 patients with COPD and 212 control subjects were determined by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the mEPHX, GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 genes. All subjects were smokers or exsmokers. The proportion of GSTM1-null genotypes was significantly higher in patients with COPD than in control subjects (61.4 versus 42.5%). No differences were observed in the frequency of polymorphic genotypes for mEPHX, GSTT1 and GSTP1. During combined analysis of genetic polymorphisms for mEPHX, GSTM1 and GSTP1, it was found that there are strong indicators for susceptibility to COPD (genotype combination with at least one mutant mEPHX exon-3 allele (histidine 113), GSTM1 null and homozygous for the GSTPI isoleucine 105 allele). The frequencies of homozygous mutant alleles of mEPHX exon 3 and the GSTMI-null genotype were significantly higher in patients with severe COPD (forced expiratory volume in one second of <35% of the predicted value).

Available forensic DNA prediction systems enable the reliable prediction of several eye and hair colour categories. However, there is still space for improvement. Here we verified the association of 38 candidate DNA polymorphisms from 13 genes and explored the extent to which interactions between them may be involved in human pigmentation and their impact on forensic DNA prediction in particular. The model-building set included 718 Polish samples and the model-verification set included 307 independent Polish samples and additional 72 samples from Japan.

By a genome-wide association screening of TD in 50 Japanese schizophrenia patients with treatment-resistant TD and 50 Japanese schizophrenia patients without TD (non-TD group) and subsequent confirmation in independent samples of 36 treatment-resistant TD and 136 non-TD subjects, we identified association of a single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2445142, (allelic p=2 x 10(-5)) in the HSPG2 (heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2, perlecan) gene with TD. The risk allele was significantly associated with higher expression of HSPG2 in postmortem human prefrontal brain (p<0.01). Administration of daily injection of haloperidol (HDL) for 50 weeks significantly reduced Hspg2 expression in mouse brains (p<0.001). Vacuous chewing movements (VCMs) induced by 7-week injection of haloperidol-reserpine were significantly infrequent in adult Hspg2 hetero-knockout mice compared with wild-type littermates (p<0.001). Treatment by the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, physostigmine, was significantly effective for reduction of VCMs in wild-type mice but not in Hspg2 hetero-knockout mice. These findings suggest that the HSPG2 gene is involved in neuroleptic-induced TD and higher expression of HSPG2, probably even after antipsychotic treatment, and may be associated with TD susceptibility.", "title": "Association of the HSPG2 gene with neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia.", "pmid": "20072119", "id": "763"},
{"abstract": "Refractive error is a complex ocular trait governed by both genetic and environmental factors and possibly their interplay. Thus far, data on the interaction between genetic variants and environmental risk factors for refractive errors are largely lacking. By using findings from recent genome-wide association studies, we investigated whether the main environmental factor, education, modifies the effect of 40 single nucleotide polymorphisms on refractive error among 8461 adults from five studies including ethnic Chinese, Malay and Indian residents of Singapore. Three genetic loci SHISA6-DNAH9, GJD2 and ZMAT4-SFRP1 exhibited a strong association with myopic refractive error in individuals with higher secondary or university education (SHISA6-DNAH9: rs2969180 A allele, \u03b2 = -0.33 D, P = 3.6 \u00d7 10(-6); GJD2: rs524952 A allele, \u03b2 = -0.31 D, P = 1.68 \u00d7 10(-5); ZMAT4-SFRP1: rs2137277 A allele, \u03b2 = -0.47 D, P = 1.68 \u00d7 10(-4)), whereas the association at these loci was non-significant or of borderline significance in those with lower secondary education or below (P for interaction: 3.82 \u00d7 10(-3)-4.78 \u00d7 10(-4)). The evidence for interaction was strengthened when combining the genetic effects of these three loci (P for interaction = 4.40 \u00d7 10(-8)), and significant interactions with education were also observed for axial length and myopia.

DRP-2 is also referred to as collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP-2). We have previously demonstrated that the DRP-2 gene is associated with susceptibility to schizophrenia, but not to bipolar disorders. In addition, a genetic association was observed with paranoid-type schizophrenia, but not with hebephrenic-type schizophrenia. It has been well documented that repeated abuse of methamphetamine (METH) for a long period frequently produces psychotic symptoms, such as auditory hallucinations and delusions that are hardly distinguishable from those of paranoid-type schizophrenia. Therefore, we hypothesized that a certain genetic variant of the DRP-2 gene may affect individual vulnerability to the development of METH-induced psychosis. We examined the genetic association by a case-control method. The polymorphism *2236T>C in the 3' untranslated region of the DRP-2 gene, which has been shown to be a negative genetic risk factor for paranoid-type schizophrenia, was analyzed in 198 patients with METH psychosis and 221 corresponding healthy controls in a Japanese population. No significant association of the DRP-2 gene with METH psychosis was found. Neither did we find an association with the clinical phenotype of METH psychosis, such as the age of first consumption of METH, latency to development of psychosis after METH abuse, prognosis of psychosis after detoxification from METH use, complication of spontaneous relapse of psychosis without reconsumption of the drug, or multisubstance abuse status.

This study genotyped 97 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 25 candidate genes in 659 dogs across eight breeds from three locations (UK, USA and Japan). These genes were selected from hAD literature, and previous cAD gene expression experiments. The aim of this study was to identify any shared gene associations between cAD and hAD. Only one SNP within the TSLP-receptor was associated with all eight breeds (corrected p=0.037). Five SNPs within Filaggrin, DPP4, MS4A2, and INPPL1 were associated with cAD, but only in certain breeds from different locations. Though these associations are broadly similar to hAD the variability of results across the breeds and locations demonstrates that a candidate gene approach using mixed breeds from different locations is not appropriate. This study therefore suggests that further candidate gene studies in cAD should be breed and location specific to increase the likelihood of finding associations with the disease.", "title": "Despite identifying some shared gene associations with human atopic dermatitis the use of multiple dog breeds from various locations limits detection of gene associations in canine atopic dermatitis.", "pmid": "20728225", "id": "767"},
{"abstract": "Tissue-specific alternative splicing of exon 11 of the insulin receptor gene results in 2 mRNAs that differ by 36 nucleotides within the coding region. The 2 transcripts encode 2 protein isoforms with (Ex11+) or without (Ex11-) 12 additional amino acids at the carboxy-terminus of the receptor alpha-subunit. Previous studies of the 2 isoforms of the human insulin receptor expressed in mammalian cell transfectants have revealed small functional differences at the levels of equilibrium insulin binding affinity and acute ligand-induced receptor internalization. In the present study, we determined the biochemical basis for differential insulin binding affinity. Further functional characterization of the 2 receptor isoforms was also performed. The results obtained were as follows. 1) Studies of ligand association demonstrated a faster (1.8-fold) \"on rate\" for Ex11- receptors than for Ex11+ receptors, as determined by the kinetics of [125I]insulin binding to transfected cells. In addition, dissociation of prebound [125I]insulin from Ex11- receptors was characterized by an accelerated \"off rate\" relative to that of Ex11+ receptors. 2) Using both intact Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and partially purified solubilized insulin receptors, the ability of insulin-like growth factor-I to compete for [125I]insulin binding to either isoform differed markedly. The mean IC50 for Ex11- was 40 nM vs. 350 nM for Ex11+. 3) Both Ex11- and Ex11+ receptors were equally capable of hybrid formation with endogenous CHO cell insulin-like growth factor-I receptors. 4) The relative abilities of 2 inhibitory polyclonal antiinsulin receptor antisera to displace [125I]insulin binding did not differ between the two isoforms. 5) Studies of insulin-induced (300 nM) receptor down-regulation in CHO cell transfectants suggested preferential down-regulation of Ex11- receptors; however, no down-regulation difference was observed when Rat 1 cell transfectants expressing the two splice variants were studied.

Also, it has been suggested that abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and serotonergic neural transmission are important mechanisms in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. Group II mGluRs play an important role in regulating the function of these mechanisms. From these results, it has been suggested that abnormalities in Group II mGluRs might be involved in the pathophysiology of mood disorders, including MDD) and BP, and may influence the clinical response to treatment with SSRIs in MDD. Therefore, we studied the association between Group II mGluR genes (GRM2 and GRM3) and mood disorders and the efficacy of fluvoxamine treatment in Japanese MDD patients. Using three tagging SNPs in GRM2 and an SNP (rs6465084) reported functional variant in GRM3, we conducted a genetic association analysis of case-control samples (325 MDD patients, 155 BP patients and 802 controls) in the Japanese population. In addition, we performed an association analysis of GRM2 and GRM3 and the efficacy of fluvoxamine treatment in 117 Japanese patients with MDD.

The subjects included 207 male workers who had been followed-up with respect to liver function periodically since 1992. Information relating to current alcohol consumption and smoking habits was obtained by an interviewer-administered questionnaire in 1996, and any history of liver function and hepatitis B and C virus infection was obtained from previous medical surveillance.

However, the association between the progression and AR expression or mutations is still controversial. In this study, we evaluated the prognostic significance of AR expression and mutations in prostate cancers. Forty-two prostate adenocarcinomas and three lymph node metastatic lesions sampled prior to hormonal therapy were included in this study; AR expression was analyzed immunohistochemically using an antibody against AR and the result was scored as the percentage of AR-positive tumor cells in the total tumor cells. Polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing were used to detect AR mutations. Our study revealed the average AR expression in the prostate adenocarcinoma was 52.2 +/- 27.1%, which was significantly lower than that in the adjacent non-tumorous prostate tissue (68.3 +/- 18.3% in average) (P < 0.001). A significant correlation was obtained between progression-free survival and AR expression (P < 0.01). By SSCP analysis, three silent mutations (T649T, E709E and E711E) were detected in three separate prostate carcinomas. : We conclude that AR expression is a useful prognostic indicator for tumor progression.

To assess erectile conditions the five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) was used. The eNOS G894T polymorphisms were determined using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method.

In a univariate analysis, age, serum testosterone level, and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension were significantly different between patients with ED and the healthy controls (P < 0.01). In the multiple logistic regression analysis, DM, age and hypogonadism were three independent risk factors for ED (P = 0.018, P = 0.046 and P = 0.016, respectively). The prevalence of ED in T allele carriers (GT/TT) was significantly greater than in G allele carriers (GG; 80.0% vs 63.3%, P = 0.04).

{"abstract": "The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is classified into Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Recently, an association between sarcoidosis and the butyrophilin-like 2 (BTNL2) gene was reported. BTNL2 is located in the HLA region and its messenger RNA is expressed most abundantly in the intestine. In this study, we performed a case-control association study of BTNL2 in the Japanese patients with IBD and performed linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis between BTNL2 and HLA-DRB1. We analyzed eight polymorphisms selected after direct sequencing and found that none of the polymorphisms were associated with the Japanese CD cohort. In contrast, five polymorphisms were significantly associated with UC, especially three single nucleotide polymorphisms (BTNL2_19, BTNL2_22 and BTNL2_23) were associated as a haplotype. The most frequent haplotype (GGC haplotype) was a low-risk haplotype (P= 0.000052), whereas the other TCT haplotype was a high-risk haplotype (P= 0.0000085). Among the eight polymorphisms, the strongest association with UC was found in BTNL2_19 (OR = 1.92, P= 0.0000035). As expected, the BTNL2_19-T allele showed strong LD with DRB1*1502 (D'= 0.92). When BTNL2_19 was tested as conditional on the DRB1*1502 carrier status, the significant association disappeared, suggesting that the association was because of its strong LD with DRB1*1502. We conclude that BTNL2 does not contribute to the susceptibility to Japanese CD but is associated with Japanese UC because of the strong LD with HLA-DRB1*1502. The strong LD between BTNL2 and HLA-DRB1 raises another issue about the potential role of BTNL2 in other diseases associated with HLA-DRB1.", "title": "Butyrophilin-like 2 gene is associated with ulcerative colitis in the Japanese under strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DRB1*1502.", "pmid": "17610417", "id": "785"},

{"abstract": "The Y chromosome carries several genes involved in spermatogenesis, which are distributed in three regions in the euchromatic part of the long arm, called AZFa (azoospermia factor a), AZFb, and AZFc. Microdeletions in these regions have been seen in 10-15% of sterile males with azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia. The relatively high de novo occurrence of these microdeletion events might be due to particular chromosome arrangements associated with certain Y chromosome haplogroups. To test whether there is any association between Y chromosome types and male infertility, we studied a sample of 84 Japanese oligozoospermic or azoospermic males. The patients were analyzed for the presence of Yq microdeletions and also typed with a battery of unique event polymorphisms (UEPs) to define their Y haplogroups. Six of the infertile patients presented likely pathological microdeletions detectable with the sequence tagged sites (STS) markers used. There was no significant association between Y chromosome haplogroups and the microdeletions. We also compared the Y haplogroup frequencies in our subset sample of 51 idiopathic azoospermia patients with 57 fertile control Japanese males, and did not observe any significant differences.

One of the critical problems responsible for 'spurious' association findings in case-control studies is population stratification.

Estimation of the minimum number of SNPs loci necessary for detection of the population structure was performed. Two clustering approaches, distance-based and model-based, were compared. The model-based approach was superior when compared with the distance-based method. We found more than 65 random SNPs loci are required for identifying distinct geographically separated populations.

Of the 14 SNPs, rs1799782 and rs1799793 did not display the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the control group. Moreover, the genotype distribution differed significantly between the two groups for the SNPs rs25487, rs3218536, and rs1799793. The rs25487 G/G genotype strongly and significantly increased the risk of glioma when compared with the rs25487 A/A genotype, indicated by an odds ratio (OR) = 2.23 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 1.36-3.87]. The rs25489 A/G genotype was also significantly associated with increased risk of glioma when compared with the A/A genotype (OR = 1.52; 95%CI = 1.03-2.35). In addition, rs1799782 increased the risk of glioma (OR = 1.89; 95%CI = 1.27-3.04), and a similar association was found for rs1800067 (OR = 1.89; 95%CI = 1.21-3.07). In conclusion, the results of our study suggest that the rs25487, rs25489, rs1799793, and rs13181 SNPs are associated with an increased risk of glioma. These findings may be useful for identifying the genetic factors involved in the development of glioma to help devise more efficient strategies to prevent this disease.", "title": "Investigation of the effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in DNA repair genes on the risk of glioma.", "pmid": "24634177", "id": "801"},
{"abstract": "Although genetic epidemiologic studies have suggested that several genetic variants increase the risk for hypertension, the genes that underlie genetic susceptibility to this condition remain to be identified definitively. We have now performed a large-scale association study to identify gene polymorphisms for reliable assessment of the genetic component of hypertension. The study population comprised 4853 unrelated Japanese individuals, including 2818 subjects with hypertension (1677 men, 1141 women) and 2035 controls (1011 men, 1024 women). The genotypes for 150 polymorphisms of 128 candidate genes were determined with a method that combines the polymerase chain reaction and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes with suspension array technology. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and the prevalence of smoking revealed that four polymorphisms (1648G-->A in ITGA2, -30G-->A in GCK, A-->G in SAH, and 1117C-->A in PTGIS) were significantly (P < .01) associated with hypertension. A stepwise forward selection procedure demonstrated that ITGA2, GCK, and PTGIS genotypes significantly affected the prevalence of hypertension. Combined genotype analysis of these polymorphisms yielded a lowest odds ratio of 0.47 for the genotypes of AA or AG for ITGA2, GA or AA for GCK, and CC for PTGIS, which were present in 1.1% and 2.0% of hypertensive and control individuals, respectively. These results suggest that the genotypes for ITGA2, GCK, and PTGIS may prove reliable for the assessment of the genetic component of hypertension.

{"abstract": "Higher cognitive performance, maintenance of mental health and psychological well-being require adequate prefrontal cortex (PFC) function. \"Inverted U-shaped\" dopamine model indicates optimal PFC dopamine level is important to attain its function while high or low levels have adverse effects. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) may be involved in this complex non-linear PFC dopamine regulation. We addressed whether genetic variation reflecting COMT and MTHFR activities can explain the inter-individual mental health differences in healthy Japanese men (n=188). The mental health was measured by Mental Health Inventory (MHI)-5 score. The rs4633-rs4818-rs4680 haplotypes were used to represent the multilevel COMT activities, while for MTHFR, the functional single polymorphism, rs1801133 (C677T), was used. We examined the effectiveness of haplotype-based association analysis of COMT on mental health together with studying its interaction with MTHFR-C677T. As a result, the relation between activity-ranked COMT genotype and MHI-5 score showed a tendency to fit into an \"inverted U-shaped\" quadratic curve (P=0.054). This curvilinear correlation was significant in the subjects with MTHFR-CC (P<0.001), but not with MTHFR T-allele carriers (P=0.793).

{"abstract": "There have been many studies investigating the association between gene polymorphisms and coronary artery disease (CAD) including myocardial infarction (MI), and some studies have shown that certain gene polymorphisms are associated with CAD/MI. However, the results of the association have sometimes been controversial. The reason may be that the contribution of genetic risk factors to CAD/MI varies depending on the ethnic, environmental, and habitual backgrounds, and differs between males and females. In this study, we analyzed 17 polymorphisms in 12 candidate genes for MI in 136 patients and 200 to 235 controls, and found that there is a significant association of MI with the polymorphisms in the genes for E-selectin and CD14 receptor. To further explore the association, we investigated the C-260 T polymorphism in the promoter region of the CD14 gene in 502 MI patients and 527 control subjects. The genotype distributions of the CD14 polymorphism were as follows: patients; T/T 32.5%, C/T 48.2%, C/C 19.3%, and controls; T/T 25.4%, C/T 52.8%, C/C 21.8%. The frequencies of the T/T homozygotes were significantly higher in the patients (OR = 1.41, P = 0.013) than in the control group, confirming the association of CD14 polymorphism with MI in Japanese. Stratification analyses further demonstrated that the association was more prominent in females and in patients with a relatively low body mass index, suggesting that the contribution of the CD14-linked genetic risk to MI differs with respect to gender and habitual background.", "title": "Association study of CD14 polymorphism with myocardial infarction in a Japanese population.", "pmid": "14587643", "id": "804"},
{"abstract": "Angiotensin II has been shown to have possible mitogenic and angiogenic effects in human cell lines and animal models of breast cancer. It is converted from its precursor to its active form by the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). A recent epidemiological study observed lower breast cancer incidence in female users of ACE inhibitors relative to nonusers with comparable cardiovascular conditions. To study the hypothesis that reduced ACE activity is associated with reduced risk of breast cancer, we conducted a nested case-control study within the Singapore Chinese Health Study Cohort to investigate the associations between the ACE A-240T and I/D gene polymorphisms, and breast cancer risk. For this analysis, 189 incident breast cancer cases and 671 female cohort control subjects were compared. The low-activity A and I alleles were the putative \"low-risk\" alleles. The I/D and A-240T genotypes exhibited significant linkage disequilibrium among Singapore Chinese (contingency coefficient = 0.74; P < 0.001). With adjustment for breast cancer risk factors, women with one or two copies of the low activity A allele showed a statistically significant reduction in risk compared with those with the TT genotype [odds ratio (OR), 0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.34-0.90]. The risk reduction was enhanced after excluding subjects with medical conditions for which ACE inhibitors are commonly prescribed (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27-0.89). Comparable results were obtained with respect to the I/D genotype and risk of breast cancer. When the I/D and A-240T genotypes were considered simultaneously, compared with women with the high-activity genotypes (either TT or DD or both), those with the low-activity genotypes (presence of both A and I alleles) exhibited lower breast cancer risk (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.27-0.81).

Two SNPs, rs3803662 and rs13387042, were significantly associated with increased BC risk in familial BC and in non-familial early-onset BC. The risk of BC increased in a dose-dependent manner with the number of risk alleles (P-trend < 0.0001 and 0.0091, respectively). The odds ratios for BC in familial BC and in early-onset non-familial BC were 3.76 (95%CI 1.02-13.84, P = 0.046) and 8.0 (95%CI 2.20-29.04, P = 0.002), respectively, for the maximum versus minimum number of risk alleles. These results indicate an additive effect of the TOX3 rs3803662 and 2q35 rs13387042 alleles for BC risk. We also evaluated the interaction between rs3803662 and rs13387042 SNPs. We observed an additive interaction only in non-familial early-onset BC cases (AP = 0.72 (0.28-1.16), P = 0.001). No significant association was observed for rs13281615 (8q24) with BC risk in women from the Chilean population.

{"abstract": "Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a key enzyme regulating folate metabolism, which affects DNA synthesis and methylation. This study investigated the relation of MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms to colorectal cancer in a case-control study in Fukuoka, Japan. The subjects comprised 685 incident cases of histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinomas and 778 community controls selected randomly in the study area. The genotype was determined by the PCR-RFLP method using genomic DNA extracted from buffy coat. Alcohol use was ascertained by in-person interview. Statistical adjustment was made for gender, age class, area, and alcohol use. The MTHFR 677TT genotype was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the risk with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.69 (95% confidence interval 0.51-0.93) compared with the 677CC and 677CT combined, and the decrease was most evident in individuals with no alcohol consumption. While the A1298C polymorphism showed no measurable association with the overall risk of colorectal cancer, the 1298CC genotype was associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk when alcohol consumption was high, and was also associated with an approximately 2-fold increase in the risk of each of proximal and distal colon cancer. The findings add to evidence that individuals with the MTHFR 677TT genotype have a decreased risk of colorectal cancer in the absence of folate depletion, suggesting a protective role of folate by ensuring a sufficient thymidylate pool for DNA synthesis. Because very few individuals had the 1298CC genotype, the findings regarding the A1298C polymorphism need careful interpretation and confirmation in larger studies.", "title": "Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and colorectal cancer: the Fukuoka Colorectal Cancer Study.", "pmid": "15546509", "id": "820"},
{"abstract": "Accumulation of visceral fat increases cardiovascular mortality in industrialized societies. However, during the evolution of the modern human, visceral fat may have acted as energy storage facility to survive in times of famine. Therefore, past natural selection might contribute to shaping the variation of visceral fat accumulation in present populations. Here, we report that the gene encoding tribbles homolog 2 (TRIB2) influenced visceral fat accumulation and was operated by recent positive natural selection in East Asians. Our candidate gene association analysis on 11 metabolic traits of 5,810 East Asians revealed that rs1057001, a T/A transversion polymorphism in 3'untranslated region (UTR) of TRIB2, was strongly associated with visceral fat area (VFA) and waist circumference adjusted for body mass index (P\u00a0=\u00a02.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-6) and P\u00a0=\u00a09.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-6), respectively). rs1057001 was in absolute linkage disequilibrium with a conserved insertion-deletion polymorphism in the 3'UTR and was associated with allelic imbalance of TRIB2 transcript levels in adipose tissues. rs1057001 showed high degree of interpopulation variation of the allele frequency; the low-VFA-associated A allele was found with high frequencies in East Asians. Haplotypes containing the rs1057001 A allele exhibited a signature of a selective sweep, which may have occurred 16,546-27,827\u00a0years ago in East Asians. Given the predominance of the thrifty gene hypothesis, it is surprising that the apparently non-thrifty allele was selectively favored in the evolution of modern humans. Environmental/physiological factors other than famine would be needed to explain the non-neutral evolution of TRIB2 in East Asians.", "title": "Positive natural selection of TRIB2, a novel gene that influences visceral fat accumulation, in East Asia.", "pmid": "23108367", "id": "821"},

Thirteen individual case-control studies were eventually recruited for GSTM1 null polymorphism (including 951 ADIH cases, 1,922 controls) and 12 studies for GSTT1 null polymorphism (847 cases, 1,811 controls). Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were appropriately calculated from fixed-effects or random-effects models. Subgroup analyses were stratified by ethnicity and different treatment combinations. The overall ORs of relevant studies that exhibited elevated ADIH risk was significantly associated with GSTM1 null genotypes (OR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.04-1.79), but for the GSTT1 polymorphism, no difference was found (OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.82-1.18).

Moreover, the GSTT1 null genotype evaluated the susceptibility to ADIH for tuberculosis using HRZ. This meta-analysis provides evidence that there may be an increased risk of ADIH in individuals with null genotypes of GSTM1 in the total population, especially East Asians and patients receiving HRZE or HRZES.

{"abstract": "Although bone mineral density (BMD) is a complex trait that is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, heritability studies in twins and families have shown that genetic factors account for 60-85% of the variance in BMD. We examined the relations of six candidate gene polymorphisms to BMD in community-dwelling women and men. The 2238 subjects (1110 women, 1128 men) were aged 40-79 years and were randomly recruited to a population-based prospective cohort study of aging and age-related diseases in Japan. BMD at the distal and proximal radius was measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and BMD for the total body, lumbar spine (L2-L4), right femoral neck, and right trochanter was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Genotypes for the 1019Cright curved arrow T (Pro319Ser) polymorphism of GJA4 and the 1462Aright curved arrow G (Lys469Glu) polymorphism of ICAM1 were determined with a fluorescence-based allele-specific DNA primer assay system, and those for the 386Gright curved arrow A (Ala99Thr) polymorphism of PLOD1, the Aright curved arrow G polymorphism of CNR2, the 1583Gright curved arrow A (Arg528Lys) polymorphism of ALAP, and the -514Cright curved arrow T polymorphism of LIPC were determined by melting curve analysis. The polymorphisms of ALAP and PLOD1 were associated with BMD in premenopausal women; those of ICAM1 and LIPC with BMD in postmenopausal women; that of CNR2 with BMD in premenopausal and postmenopausal women; and that of GJA4 with BMD in men. Among these polymorphisms, those of ICAM1, CNR2, and GJA4 were markedly associated with BMD. These results suggest that ALAP, PLOD1, ICAM1, LIPC, and CNR2 are susceptibility loci for reduced bone mass in Japanese women and that GJA4 constitutes such a locus in Japanese men.

As possible confounders in determining anxiety, childhood maltreatment and gender as well as their interactions with BDNF polymorphism have been suggested. This study examined the effect of BDNF genotype, childhood maltreatment, and their interaction on anxiety levels by gender. A total of 206 unrelated Korean healthy young adults (108 were male and the mean age was 23.1 \u00b1 3.2 years) were genotyped for the BDNFVal66Met polymorphism. Measures for anxiety and childhood maltreatment were completed. The main and interaction effects of BDNF polymorphism and childhood maltreatment on anxiety were analyzed by general linear models in all subjects and then in gender-stratified groups. Gender-specific analyses revealed that the interaction effect was significant only in males (p = 0.014). Interestingly, male subjects with the Val/Met genotype tended to be resilient against the increased anxiety after childhood maltreatment. In females, the main effects of both BDNF genotype and childhood maltreatment were significant (p = 0.024 and p = 0.009, respectively) and post-hoc analysis revealed that the Val/Val genotype was associated with a higher anxiety than the Met/Met genotype (p = 0.004).

The goal was to evaluate the differences in genetic contribution to lung cancer risk by ethnic groups. Analyses of individual SNPs and haplotypes were performed using unconditional logistic regressions adjusted for age, sex and genetic ancestry. Four SNPs among Latinos and one SNP among African-Americans were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with either risk of all lung cancer or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, only the association between XRCC1 Arg399Gln (rs25487) and NSCLC among Latinos (odds ratio associated with every copy of Gln = 1.52; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-2.28) had a false-positive report probability of <0.5. Arg399Gln is a SNP with some functional evidence and has been shown previously to be an important SNP associated with lung cancer, mostly for Asians. Since the analyses were adjusted for genetic ancestry, the observed association between Arg399Gln and NSCLC among Latinos is unlikely to be confounded by population stratification; however, this result needs to be confirmed by additional studies among the Latino population.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene, located on chromosome 17q23, has been regarded as a candidate susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD), because ACE could degrade beta-amyloid, the pathological hallmark of AD, thereby inhibiting its aggregation. The level and activity of ACE, in part, may be modulated by the insertion or deletion (indel) polymorphism of ACE gene. The indel polymorphism, consisting of the presence or absence of a 287-bp DNA fragment, has been considered the biomarker of AD, although its validity varies with race. In the Japanese, seemingly different results have been reported. One report shows significant association of insertion homozygote with AD, whereas other shows no association of indel polymorphism with AD. In the Taiwanese, the significant association of deletion homozygote with AD was found. Moreover, clinical studies have shown that using ACE inhibitors could slow the deterioration of cognitive function in AD patients, despite that ACE can degrade beta-amyloid. These heterogeneous results on the association of ACE gene with AD and clinical significance of using ACE inhibitor in AD highlight the necessity of exploring detailed mechanisms from the ACE gene to the development of AD.

Significant obesity associations (p < 0.1 two-tailed, concordant direction with previous reports) were replicated for 11 SNPs from the following ten loci in Japanese participants: SEC16B, TMEM18, GNPDA2, BDNF, MTCH2, BCDIN3D-FAIM2, SH2B1-ATP2A1, FTO, MC4R and KCTD15. The strongest effect was observed at TMEM18 rs4854344 (p = 7.1 \u00d7 10(-7) for BMI). Among the 11 SNPs showing significant obesity association, six were also associated with diabetes (OR 1.05-1.17; p = 0.04-2.4 \u00d7 10(-7)) after adjustment for BMI in the Japanese. When meta-analysed with data from the previous reports, the BMI-adjusted diabetes association was found to be highly significant for the FTO locus in East Asians (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.09-1.18; p = 7.8 \u00d7 10(-10)) with substantial inter-ethnic heterogeneity (p = 0.003).

Occult HBV infection is associated with a risk of HBV transmission through blood transfusion, hemodialysis, and liver transplantation. Furthermore, occult HBV infection contributes to the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. We recently reported the characteristic molecular features of mutations in the preS/S regions among Korean individuals with occult infections caused by HBV genotype C2; the variants of preS and S related to severe liver diseases among chronically infected patients were also responsible for the majority of HBV occult infections. We also reported that HBsAg variants from occult-infected Korean individuals exhibit lower HBsAg secretion capacity but not reduced HBV DNA levels. In addition, these variants exhibit increased ROS-inducing capacity compared with the wild-type strain, linking HBV occult infections to liver cell damage. Taken together, our previous reports suggest the transmission potential of distinct HBV occult infection-related variants in South Korea.

However, the association of polymorphisms in the aldosterone synthase gene (CYP11B2) with hypertension or cardiac hypertrophy remains controversial. To evaluate the distribution of polymorphisms in the CYP11B2 gene and the possible associations between genotypes and blood pressure, urinary excretion of aldosterone or electrolytes and echocardiographic measurements, in a Japanese population. We examined the association of two common diallelic polymorphisms within CYP11B2, one in the promoter -344T/C and the other an intron 2 gene conversion, with blood pressure, 24-h urinary excretion of aldosterone and electrolytes, and echocardiographic measurements, in a Japanese population. We confirmed significant linkage disequilibrium between these polymorphic loci and ethnic differences in frequency of the alleles. The -344C and -344T haplotypes apparently diverged before the intron conversion polymorphism was generated on the latter haplotype. Allele frequencies did not differ between 535 normotensive and 360 hypertensive individuals or between hypertensive individuals with higher and lower concentrations of renin. The only significant correlation was a positive correlation of left ventricular mass with 24-h urinary excretion of sodium, which occurred only in individuals with the -344CC genotype or the intron 2 conversion (-/-) genotype. The -344CC or intron 2 conversion (-/-) genotype in CYP11B2 may be a risk factor for developing sodium-sensitive cardiac hypertrophy.

The aim of this study is to examine the single and combined effects of CRH receptor 1 (CRHR1) and BDNF genes in recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD). The sample consists of 181 patients with recurrent MDD and 186 healthy controls. Whether genetic variations interaction between CRHR1 and BDNF genes might be associated with increased susceptibility to recurrent MDD was studied by using a gene-based association analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). CRHR1 gene (rs1876828, rs242939 and rs242941) and BDNF gene (rs6265) were identified in the samples of patients diagnosed with recurrent MDD and matched controls.

A polysomnography study embedded in a population-based cohort from the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study was conducted in 2011-2013. 1,763 participants aged 48-78 years. 251 individuals were identified to have OSA with an apnea-hypopnea index \u2265 15. A common polymorphism of neuregulin-1 gene (NRG1), rs10097555, was selected as the most suggestive locus associated with OSA (P value < 10(-5)) based on the results of GWA analysis in a matched case-control subsample (n = 470). Among 1,763 participants, we found that the presence of the NRG1 polymorphism is inversely associated with OSA (P value < 0.01) even after taking into account potential risk factors; the multivariate odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the mutant alleles was 0.57 (0.39-0.82) compared with the wild-type. We observed that this association is modified by alcohol consumption (P < 0.05), not by obesity. We also observed that WMH are positively associated with OSA independent of the NRG1 polymorphism and alcohol consumption (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that the neuregulin-1 gene (NRG1) may be involved in the etiological mechanisms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and that carriers of a particular NRG1 mutation may be less likely to have OSA if they do not drink alcoholic beverages.", "title": "Associations of Sleep Apnea, NRG1 Polymorphisms, Alcohol Consumption, and Cerebral White Matter Hyperintensities: Analysis with Genome-Wide Association Data.", "pmid": "25325441", "id": "844"},

Indeed, mutations in the FOXP3 gene cause severe systemic autoimmune diseases in humans and in mice. Therefore, we hypothesized that the FOXP3 gene may be associated with thyroid autoimmunity which is among the typical autoimmune diseases that develop in individuals with FOXP3 mutations. Moreover, the FOXP3 gene is located within an X-chromosome locus (Xp11.23) previously shown to be linked with autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD). We tested the FOXP3 gene locus for association with AITD in two large cohorts of US Caucasians and Japanese AITD patients. We analyzed 269 Caucasian AITD patients (52 males and 217 females) and 357 Caucasian controls (159 males and 198 females), as well as 377 female Japanese AITD patients and 179 female Japanese controls. The FOXP3 gene locus was analyzed using four microsatellite polymorphisms [(GT)n; (TC)n; DXS573; DXS1208] flanking the FOXP3 gene locus. Interestingly, while no association was found between FOXP3 polymorphisms and AITD in the Japanese cohort there was a significant association in the Caucasian cohort. There was a significant association of the (TC)n polymorphism with AITD in the Caucasian male AITD patients (p=0.011; 5 degrees of freedom [df]). Similarly, there was an association between the DXS573 microsatellite and AITD in the Caucasian female AITD patients (p=0.00023; 4 df).

We found four mutations in the coding sequences of WNT6 which appear to exist in a small proportion of Chinese women with unexplained RM. WNT6 has been proved to be essential for stromal cell proliferation during decidualization in mice, but in humans WNT6 has not been studied in recurrent miscarriage populations. For this study, 100 couples with unexplained RM (at least three or more unexplained spontaneous miscarriages), and 100 ethnically matched fertile couples (at least one live birth and no history of pregnancy pathologies) were recruited. All the participants were chosen over a 7-year period from the National Research Center for Assisted Reproductive Technology and Reproductive Genetics at Shandong University, Jinan, China. Patients were recruited following extensive clinical studies. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood. Mutation analysis in the coding regions of WNT6 was performed by PCR amplification and DNA sequences testing in all participants. Functional effects of missense variants were predicted using Polyphen-2 and sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT). Four rare novel mutations, including one missense mutation, were found in intron 1, exon 3 and the 3' untranslated region of WNT6 in four women with unexplained RM. Gene software predictions showed that the missense mutation in exon 3 could alter the function of WNT6. No mutations or polymorphisms were detected in the male partners of the unexplained RM patients or in the fertile controls. To further validate the findings, we continued to screen this missense mutation site in another 100 peripheral blood samples of normal fertile females, and there was still no positive result. There is no direct evidence to validate whether these novel mutations discovered in the present research are related to unexplained RM. Further studies are warranted to investigate the role of WNT6 in unexplained RM, including larger studies in an independent group.

In the past few years, the main features of the East Asian portion of the mtDNA phylogeny have been determined on the basis of complete sequencing efforts, but representatives of several basal lineages were still lacking. Moreover, some recently published complete mtDNA sequences did apparently not fit into the known phylogenetic tree and conflicted with the established nomenclature. To refine the East Asian mtDNA tree and resolve data conflicts, we first completely sequenced 20 carefully selected mtDNAs--likely representatives of novel sub-haplogroups--and then, in order to distinguish diagnostic mutations of novel haplogroups from private variants, we applied a 'motif-search' procedure to a large sample collection. The novel information was incorporated into an updated East Asian mtDNA tree encompassing more than 1000 (near-) complete mtDNA sequences. A reassessment of the mtDNA data from a series of disease studies testified to the usefulness of such a refined mtDNA tree in evaluating the pathogenicity of mtDNA mutations. In particular, the claimed pathogenic role of mutations G3316A, T3394C, A4833G and G15497A appears to be most questionable as those initial claims were derived from anecdotal findings rather than e.g. appropriate association studies.

{"abstract": "Adenovirus type 7 (Ad7) is frequently responsible for severe respiratory infections, especially in young infants. Since the Ad7 epidemics have been associated with severe childhood pneumonia and significant mortality in Korea, 1995-1999, continuous surveillance was necessary for Ad7 related diseases. To characterize epidemiologic features of Ad7 in 1995-2004, genetic diversity of Ad7 were studied by determining genome types (GTs) and the fiber diversity. A total of 139 Ad7 strains were obtained from Korean children with pneumonia. Serotype specificity was confirmed by microneutralization assay. GTs were determined by restriction analysis with 12 enzymes. The variable region of the fiber was sequenced. Two GTs, Ad7d (N=98, 71%) and Ad7l (N=41, 29%) have been identified. In 1995-1996 and 2001-2002, Ad7d was dominant accounting for 98-100% of all Ad7; in 1999-2000, Ad7l was the prevalent GT accounting for 100% of all Ad7; in 1997-1998 and 2003-2004, both GTs circulated concurrently. The change in the relative predominance of GT occurred in 2 or 3 years. The Lys substitution for Arg at codon 280 of the fiber was identified in 31 Ad7d strains (32%) while no variations were observed among Ad7l. It was noteworthy that two fiber variants of Ad7d were not concurrently prevalent on any time after 1996. The shift in predominant fiber variants of Ad7d was also observed in 2-3 years. Our data demonstrated that the two GTs, Ad7d and Ad7l circulated in an alternating manner between outbreaks of Ad7 associated childhood pneumonia over 10 consecutive years in Korea. Fiber diversity at position 280 within Ad7d appeared to contribute to the annual distribution of Ad7d. This observation necessitates further studies to demonstrate an association between fiber variation and host cell specificity or neutralization antibody recognition.", "title": "Ten-year analysis of adenovirus type 7 molecular epidemiology in Korea, 1995-2004: implication of fiber diversity.", "pmid": "16458589", "id": "858"},
{"abstract": "Epidemiological studies indicate a genetic contribution to colorectal cancer (CRC), but specific genetic variants remain unknown. Genome-wide association studies have identified rs4444235 at BMP4 as a new colorectal cancer (CRC) and colorectal adenoma (CRA) susceptibility locus in populations of European descent. After that, several validation studies have been conducted among various ethnic populations to investigate if the SNP was associated with CRC/CRA, but the results have been inconsistent. To investigate this inconsistency and derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis involving 54,631 CRC cases, 3995 CRA cases and 88,098 controls from 15 studies was performed. Potential sources of heterogeneity including ethnicity, sample size, study design and endpoint were also assessed. Overall, the summary OR of CRC was 1.06 (95% CI: 1.04-1.08, P<10(-5)). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significantly increased risks were found in East Asians (OR=1.07, 95% CI: 1.01-1.12, P=0.01) and Caucasians (OR=1.07, 95% CI: 1.05-1.10, P<10(-5)); while no significant associations were found among African Americans and other ethnic populations in all genetic models. In addition, significant associations were also detected for CRA with per-allele OR of 1.09 (95% CI: 1.03-1.14, P=0.001).

{"abstract": "In preparation for a collaborative multidisciplinary study of the pathogenesis of esophageal cancer, the authors reviewed the published literature to identify similarities and differences between Japan and China in esophageal cancer epidemiology. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the predominant histologic type, while the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma remains extremely low in both countries. Numerous epidemiologic studies in both countries show that alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking are contributing risk factors for ESCC. There are differences, however, in many aspects of esophageal cancer between Japan and China, including cancer burden, patterns of incidence and mortality, sex ratio of mortality, risk factor profiles, and genetic variants. Overall incidence and mortality rates are higher in China than in Japan, and variation in mortality and incidence patterns is greater in China than in Japan. During the study period (1987-2000), the decline in age-adjusted mortality rates was more apparent in China than in Japan. Risk factor profiles differed between high- and low-incidence areas within China, but not in Japan. The association of smoking and drinking with ESCC risk appears to be weaker in China than in Japan. Genome-wide association studies in China showed that variants in several chromosome regions conferred increased risk, but only genetic variants in alcohol-metabolizing genes were significantly associated with ESCC risk in Japan. A well-designed multidisciplinary epidemiologic study is needed to examine the role of diet and eating habits in ESCC risk.

The previous published data on the association between XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism and cancer risk remained controversial. To derive a more precise estimation of the association between the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism and overall cancer risk, we performed a meta-analysis of 297 case-control studies, in which a total of 93,941 cases and 121,480 controls were included. Overall, significantly increased cancer risk was observed in any genetic model (dominant model: odds ration [OR] = 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01-1.07; recessive model: OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.03-1.13; additive model: OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.04-1.14) when all eligible studies were pooled into the meta-analysis. In further stratified and sensitivity analyses, significantly elevated hepatocellular and breast cancers risk were observed in Asians (dominant model: OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.06-1.84) and in Indians (dominant model: OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.31-2.04; recessive model: OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.09-3.47; additive model: OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.50-2.84), respectively. This meta-analysis suggests the participation of XRCC1 Arg399Gln is a genetic susceptibility for hepatocellular cancer in Asians and breast cancer in Indians. Moreover, our work also points out the importance of new studies for Arg399Gln association in some cancer types, such as glioma, gastric cancer, and oral cancer, where at least some of the covariates responsible for heterogeneity could be controlled, to obtain a more conclusive understanding about the function of the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism in cancer development.", "title": "Association between the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism and risk of cancer: evidence from 297 case-control studies.", "pmid": "24205095", "id": "861"},
{"abstract": "Combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin is the standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Treating CHC with SOC may show a sustained virological response (SVR) in approximately 50-70 % of genotype 1 CHC patients and an SVR in 70-90 % of genotype 2 CHC patients. The genotype, baseline viral load, and viral kinetics (i.e., rapid virologic response and early virologic response) can be used as predictors of response-guided therapy. Nonetheless, host factors, e.g. age, ethnicity, insulin resistance, and genetic variations, may also play important roles in the SVR in CHC patients treated with SOC. Recent genome-wide association studies have demonstrated that single-nucleotide polymorphisms near the interleukin 28B gene (IL28B) were associated with SVR to treatment with SOC in CHC patients. The IL28B polymorphisms may contribute to the viral kinetics during treatment. Asian people have favorable IL28B polymorphisms. This factor may at least partly explain the high eradication rate of hepatitis C by SOC in Asia. Combination therapy with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) and SOC can increase the SVR rates both in treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experienced patients. Although the IL28B polymorphisms also affect the SVR of triple therapy with SOC and first-generation protease inhibitors, pilot studies have demonstrated that potent DAAs might overcome the influence of IL28B polymorphisms.

{"abstract": "A principal goal in human genetics is to provide the tools necessary to enable genome-wide association studies. Extensive information on the distribution of gene-based single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns across the genome is required in order to choose markers for efficient implementation of this approach. To obtain such information, we have genotyped a large Japanese cohort for SNPs identified by systematic resequencing of more than 14 000 autosomal genes. Analysis of these data led to the conclusion that the Japanese population contains approximately 130 000 common autosomal gene haplotypes (frequency >0.05), of which more than 35% are identified in the present study. We also examined allele frequencies and LD patterns according to the position of variants within genes, and their distribution across the genome. We found lower allele variability at exonic SNP sites (both non-synonymous and synonymous) compared with non-exonic SNP sites, and greater average LD between SNPs within exons of the same gene compared with other SNP combinations, both of which could be signals of selection. LD was correlated with the recombination rate per physical distance as estimated from the meiotic map, but the strength of the relationship varied considerably in different regions of the genome. Unique LD patterns, characterized by frequent instances of high LD between non-adjacent SNPs punctuated by blocks of low LD, were found in a 7 Mb region on chromosome 6p that includes the MHC (major histocompatibility complex) locus and many non-MHC genes. These results demonstrate the complexity that must be taken into account when considering SNP variability and LD patterns, while also providing tools necessary for implementation of efficient genome-wide association studies.", "title": "Variation of gene-based SNPs and linkage disequilibrium patterns in the human genome.", "pmid": "15190013", "id": "863"},

In a total of 35 subgroups including 2316 subjects with the Trp64Arg variant and 4266 subjects without this variant, the weighted mean difference in BMI was 0.26 kg/m(2) (95% confidence interval: 0.18 to 0.42; p < 0.01), indicating that variant carriers exhibited higher BMI than did normal homozygous subjects. Although it is known that the allele frequency of the ADRB3 polymorphism differs among races, this study focuses on the Japanese population, which has a high allele frequency of ADRB3 polymorphism. We assumed that statistical errors would be prevented due to the sufficient number of subjects.

The current study aimed to identify novel common variants for BPD-I in an ethnically homogeneous Taiwanese sample using a multi-stage GWA study design. At the discovery stage, 200 BPD-I patients and 200 controls that combined to form 16 pools were genotyped with 1 million markers. Utilizing a newly developed rank-based method, top-ranked markers were selected. After validation with individual genotyping, a fine-mapping association study was conducted to identify associated loci using 240 patients and 240 controls. At the last stage, independent samples were collected (351 cases and 341 controls) for replication. Among the top-ranked markers from the discovery stage, eight genes and 15 individual SNPs were evaluated in the fine-mapping stage. At this stage, rs7619173, which is not in a gene coding region, showed the most significant association (P = 2 \u2217 10(-5)) with BPD-I. Four genes had empirical P-values<0.05, including KCNH7 (P = 0.0047), MYST4 (P = 0.0047), NRXN3 (P = 0.0095), and SEMA3D (P = 0.037).

In addition, we also investigated if any association exists between the TrkB SNPs and the premorbid functioning as measured by M-PAS using 62 subjects with schizophrenia. The TrkB SNPs were not significantly associated with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Although one TrkB SNP (rs920776) showed weak association with premorbid functioning (p=0.025), the significance did not remain after Bonferroni correction.

Association studies revealed a significant difference (p = 3.8 x 10(-5) between the TSHR microsatellite allele frequency distribution in 81 unrelated Japanese AITD patients and 113 Japanese controls, with a significant increase in the 180 pb allele (allele 1) of the microsatellite sequence (p = 5.8 x 10(-7).

The combined analyses identified six well-replicated SNPs with independent effects and significant lung cancer associations (P < 5.0 \u00d7 10(-8)) located in TP63 (rs4488809 at 3q28, P = 7.2 \u00d7 10(-26)), TERT-CLPTM1L (rs465498 and rs2736100 at 5p15.33, P = 1.2 \u00d7 10(-20) and P = 1.0 \u00d7 10(-27), respectively), MIPEP-TNFRSF19 (rs753955 at 13q12.12, P = 1.5 \u00d7 10(-12)) and MTMR3-HORMAD2-LIF (rs17728461 and rs36600 at 22q12.2, P = 1.1 \u00d7 10(-11) and P = 6.2 \u00d7 10(-13), respectively). Two of these loci (13q12.12 and 22q12.2) were newly identified in the Chinese population.

{"abstract": "The neurotransmitter, 5-hydroxytryptamine, acts as an immunomodulator by stimulating the release of inflammatory cytokines and regulating the function of dendritic cells and monocytes. The 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 (HTR4) gene is located in a region previously linked to an increased risk of asthma and atopy. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between HTR4 and asthma. Thirty-two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in HTR4 were investigated by direct sequencing of 24 DNA samples from unrelated Korean subjects. The 32 genetic variants comprised 22 intronic SNP, two SNP in the 3'-untranslated region (exon 7) and eight SNP in the 3'-downstream region. Logistic regression analysis showed that two intronic polymorphisms were significantly associated with the risk of asthma. Two minor HTR4 alleles, +142828G>A and +122769G>A, occurred at significantly higher frequencies in the asthmatic group than in the healthy control group (49.59% vs 42.29%, P=0.003, and 47.99% vs 40.35%, P=0.008, respectively), and these differences remained significant after correction for multiple testing (P=0.05, dominant mode of inheritance; and P=0.03, dominant mode, respectively). Haplotype analysis revealed three haplotype blocks. The frequency of haplotype 1 in block 2 was significantly higher in asthmatics (P=0.003, dominant mode), whereas the frequency of haplotype 4 in block 3 was significantly lower in asthmatics (P=0.0009, dominant mode).

{"abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a complex polygenic autoimmune disease, is associated with increased complement activation. Variants of genes encoding complement regulator factor H (CFH) and five CFH-related proteins (CFHR1-CFHR5) within the chromosome 1q32 locus linked to SLE, have been associated with multiple human diseases and may contribute to dysregulated complement activation predisposing to SLE. We assessed 60 SNPs covering the CFH-CFHRs region for association with SLE in 15,864 case-control subjects derived from four ethnic groups. Significant allelic associations with SLE were detected in European Americans (EA) and African Americans (AA), which could be attributed to an intronic CFH SNP (rs6677604, in intron 11, P(meta)\u200a=\u200a6.6\u00d710(-8), OR\u200a=\u200a1.18) and an intergenic SNP between CFHR1 and CFHR4 (rs16840639, P(meta)\u200a=\u200a2.9\u00d710(-7), OR\u200a=\u200a1.17) rather than to previously identified disease-associated CFH exonic SNPs, including I62V, Y402H, A474A, and D936E. In addition, allelic association of rs6677604 with SLE was subsequently confirmed in Asians (AS). Haplotype analysis revealed that the underlying causal variant, tagged by rs6677604 and rs16840639, was localized to a ~146 kb block extending from intron 9 of CFH to downstream of CFHR1. Within this block, the deletion of CFHR3 and CFHR1 (CFHR3-1\u0394), a likely causal variant measured using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, was tagged by rs6677604 in EA and AS and rs16840639 in AA, respectively.

These results suggested that the CFHR3-1\u0394 deletion within the SLE-associated block, but not the previously described exonic SNPs of CFH, might contribute to the development of SLE in EA, AA, and AS, providing new insights into the role of complement regulators in the pathogenesis of SLE.", "title": "Association of genetic variants in complement factor H and factor H-related genes with systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility.", "pmid": "21637784", "id": "898"},

The hypothesis that alleles encoding amino acids other than aspartic acid at the DQB1 position 57 contribute to IDDM susceptibility is not applicable to the Japanese, mainly because the first and second susceptibility haplotypes listed above have aspartic acid at DQB1 position 57. In the 5' insulin gene polymorphism, the shorter insertion (class 1 allele) is predominant, and is not associated with diabetes in Japanese.

We obtained imputed genotypes for each GWAS and performed a meta-analysis of two GWAS data sets (718 cases and 1717 controls). For follow-up, 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested in 329 cases and 861 controls. Gene ontology enrichment and candidate gene analyses were conducted using the GWAS or meta-analysis results. We also applied the polygenic score analysis to our two GWAS samples to test the hypothesis of polygenic components contributing to PD. Although genome-wide significant SNPs were not detected in either of the GWAS nor the meta-analysis, suggestive associations were observed in several loci such as BDKRB2 (P=1.3 \u00d7 10(-5), odds ratio=1.31). Among previous candidate genes, supportive evidence for association of NPY5R with PD was obtained (gene-wise corrected P=6.4 \u00d7 10(-4)). Polygenic scores calculated from weakly associated SNPs (P<0.3 and 0.4) in the discovery sample were significantly associated with PD status in the target sample in both directions (sample I to sample II and vice versa) (P<0.05).

XRCC4 is one of the potential candidate genes associated with schizophrenia which might induce colorectal cancer resistance. To examine the genetic association between colorectal cancer and schizophrenia, we analyzed five SNPs (rs6452526, rs2662238, rs963248, rs35268, rs2386275) covering ~205.7 kb in the region of XRCC4. We observed that two of the five genetic polymorphisms showed statistically significant differences between 312 colorectal cancer subjects without schizophrenia and 270 schizophrenia subjects (rs6452536, p = 0.004, OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.44-0.86; rs35268, p = 0.028, OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.05-2.26).

We performed a genome-wide association study using DNA samples from a Korean population consisting of 379 BD patients and 800 controls. A replication study was performed in a Japanese population (363 BD patients and 272 controls). To evaluate the functional implication of the target single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), gene expression levels in peripheral T cells, allele-specific modulation of promoter activity and biological effect of mRNA knockdown were investigated. We found a novel association of BD to the GIMAP locus, mapped to chromosome 7q36.1 (rs1608157, p=6.01\u00d710(-8) in a minor allele dominant model; rs11769828, allele based p=1.60\u00d710(-6)).

Replication study using DNA samples from the Japanese population validated the significant association between BD and the GIMAP locus. The GIMAP4 promoter construct plasmid with the minor allele of rs1608157 displayed significantly lower activity than one with the major allele. Moreover, CD4 T cells from BD patients showed a lower level of GIMAP4 mRNA, and GIMAP4 knockdown was protective against Fas-mediated apoptosis.

{"abstract": "Disease genes may be identified through functional, positional, and candidate gene approaches. Although extensive and often labor-intensive studies such as family linkage analysis, functional investigation of gene products and genome database searches are usually involved, thousands of human disease genes, especially for monogenic diseases with Mendelian transmission, have been identified. However, in diseases caused by more than one gene, or by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, identification of the genes is even more difficult. Common examples include atherosclerosis, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, asthma, diabetes, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration. There have been conflicting reports on the roles of associated genes. Even with population-based case-control studies and new statistical methods such as the sib-ship disequilibrium test and the discordant alleles test, there is no agreement on whether alpha2-macroglobulin (A2M) is a gene for Alzheimer's disease. Another example is the inconsistent association between age-related macular degeneration and ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCR). Ethnic variation causes further complications. In our investigation of LDL-receptor variants in familial hypercholesterolemia, and the trabecular meshwork inducible glucocorticoid response protein, or myocillin (TIGR-MYOC) mutation pattern in primary open angle glaucoma, we did find dissimilar results in Chinese compared to Caucasians.

The probable HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 and -DQB1 haplotype in association with B*40:221 may be deduced as HLA-A*11:01-B*40:221-C*03:04-DRB1*14:54-DQB1*05:02. The generation of B*40:221 is thought as a result of a nucleotide point mutation involving B*40:01:01. Our discovery of B*40:221 increases the polymorphism of B*40 in Taiwanese.

{"abstract": "A 32-year-old Taiwanese man presented to our clinic with a 6-month history of linear hair loss in a wavy and curved pattern across the parietal and occipital scalp, resembling the distribution of Blaschko's lines. Physical examination showed interfollicular erythema and follicular plugging without skin atrophy or sclerotic change. Histopathology revealed a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate in the perifollicular dermis and subcutis with abundant mucin deposition, consistent with the diagnosis of lupus panniculitis. Treatment with hydroxychloroquine and local steroid injection resulted in complete hair regrowth but recurrence was noted. Linear lupus panniculitis of the scalp presenting as alopecia along Blaschko's lines had so far been reported exclusively in five East Asians. Apart from classical lupus panniculitis, it had distinct clinical and histopathological features such as younger age of onset, male predominance, reversible clinical course without scarring, fewer associations with systemic lupus erythematosus, exclusive involvement of scalp, sparse inflammatory infiltration, abundant mucin deposition, higher degree of hyaline fat degeneration and negative results of immunofluorescent studies. Therefore, we propose linear lupus panniculitis of the scalp to be a distinct variant of lupus panniculitis and should be included in the differential diagnosis for focal or linear alopecia, especially in East Asians.", "title": "Linear lupus panniculitis of the scalp presenting as alopecia along Blaschko's lines: a distinct variant of lupus panniculitis in East Asians?", "pmid": "22220763", "id": "931"},

The molecular profile of beta-thalassaemia was consistent with that of Hb Gunma: codon 127/128CAGGCT(Gln-Ala)--> CCT(Pro). Analysis of erythrocyte membrane proteins revealed a partial deficiency of protein 4.1 in all those with HE, whereas the spectrin content was within the normal range. Each heterozygous family member with either the beta-thalassaemia trait or HE was asymptomatic, whereas the two with both beta-thalassaemia and HE had marked red blood cell deformities and haemolysis.

We used univariate and multivariate regression analyses to identify the associations between clinical characteristics and GRIN3A genetic variations in KD. According to univariate regression analysis, CAA formation in KD was significantly associated with fever duration (p < 0.0001), first Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) used (days after day one of fever) (p < 0.0001), and the GRIN3A (rs7849782) genetic variant (p < 0.001).

A stratified random household sample was selected from a community in southern Taiwan. Of 1231 subjects attending our health-screening program, 441 agreed to have additional venous blood withdrawn for DNA extraction and genetic study. Exactly 433 subjects completed the questionnaires and genetic analysis. Their telomere lengths were distributed (6.4-11.63 kb). The rate of shortening per year was 69 base pairs, and the gender difference in length was not statistically significant (F = 0.091, P = 0.763). The lognormal distribution of telomere lengths was linear. The polynomial regression analysis showed Ln (telomere length) = -2.57-0.007 x age - 0.34 MAOA (adjusted R-square = 0.60). The gender effect on telomere length was not statistically significant (P = 0.52). No interaction effects were found between age, gender and MAOA gene polymorphisms. The high-activity allele of the MAOA promoter polymorphisms were negatively associated with telomere length (P = 0.013). Structural equation modeling confirmed the null model structure. The present data suggest that high-activity MAOA promoter gene polymorphisms, as in aging, are a risk factor for telomeric shortening.

PADI4 haplotype frequencies and the presence of synovial intracellular citrullinated proteins and ACPA were comparable with previous studies. There was no significant association between PADI4 haplotype 1 or 2 and the presence of synovial intracellular citrullinated proteins, although these proteins were associated with higher serum ACPA. There was no correlation between PADI4 haplotypes and serum ACPA, either by continuous analysis using the titres or by dichotomous analysis using the diagnostic cut off.

Over the past 10 years, varicella vaccine has been given to millions of children, usually at ages between 12 and 18 months. In states such as California, Michigan, and Texas, there has been a marked decline in the number of reported cases of varicella. Furthermore, there has been a 75% decrease in varicella-related hospitalizations across the United States, as well as a similar decrease in the number of deaths caused by complications of chickenpox. The main unanticipated result has been a growing number of outbreaks of varicella among immunized children (\"breakthrough varicella\"). The most cited risk factors for breakthrough varicella include the following: (1) 3-5-year interval since immunization and (2) immunization at the youngest ages, especially 12 months. Explanations for breakthrough varicella include a lessened immune response among the youngest recipients of the vaccine. Another possibility is genetic variation among circulating VZV strains. VZV strains can be separated into two geographic clades called European/North American and Asian, based on single nucleotide polymorphisms. Two mutant North American strains have been isolated from patients in the last 10 years. Several genomic differences between Oka vaccine strain and other strains have also been identified, including one site at the DNA origin of replication. Since breakthrough disease among vaccine recipients appears to be more common in the United States than in Japan, further comparisons between the varicella vaccination programs in Japan and the United States are warranted.

{"abstract": "Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is one of the most common spinal deformities found in adolescent populations. Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a Japanese population indicated that three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs11190870, rs625039 and rs11598564, all located near the LBX1 gene, may be associated with AIS susceptibility [1]. This study suggests a novel AIS predisposition candidate gene and supports the hypothesis that somatosensory functional disorders could contribute to the pathogenesis of AIS. These findings warrant replication in other populations. First, we conducted a case-control study consisting of 953 Chinese Han individuals from southern China (513 patients and 440 healthy controls), and the three SNPs were all found to be associated with AIS predisposition. The ORs were observed as 1.49 (95% CI 1.23-1.80, P = 5.09E-5), 1.70 (95% CI 1.42-2.04, P = 1.17E-8) and 1.52 (95% CI 1.27-1.83, P = 5.54E-6) for rs625039, rs11190870 and rs11598564, respectively.

{"abstract": "5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a key enzyme in folate metabolism, plays a major role in the provision of methyl groups for DNA methylation; thymidylate synthase (TS) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of dTMP and DNA repair. The clinical role of genetic polymorphisms of MTHFR and that of the TS enhancer region (TSER) were demonstrated in several clinical studies with colorectal, esophageal, gastric and breast cancer. However, there have never been any studies on the association between cholangiocarcinoma (CCC) and genetic polymorphisms of MTHFR and TSER. Therefore, the polymorphism of MTHFR and TSER, which share a common substrate, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, in CCC was examined, concurrently. The influence of these polymorphisms on plasma homocysteine levels was also investigated. Blood samples were obtained from 47 patients with CCC and 204 healthy control donors. Using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), the C to T transition at position 677 of MTHFR and tandem repeat of 28bp in the enhancer region of TS gene were analyzed. Plasma homocysteine levels were also determined. According to the logistic regression model, a combination of MTHFR 677CC with the TSER 2R(+) genotype had a relative risk of 5.38 (95% CI, 1.23-23.56) of developing CCC compared to MTHFR 677CC with TSER 2R(-) (p = 0.0257). The level of homocysteine was lower in CCC patients than healthy controls without statistical significance (8.27 +/- 4.17 vs. 9.40 +/- 2.57, p = 0.093). Our data suggest a role of MTHFR 677CC with the TSER 2R(+) genotype in increasing the risk of CCC.

{"abstract": "A number of lines of evidence make the gene that encodes the G-protein-coupled CB1/Cnr1 receptor a strong candidate to harbor variants that might contribute to individual differences in human addiction vulnerability. The CB1/Cnr1 receptor is the major brain site at which cannabinoid marijuana constituents are psychoactive as well as the principal brain receptor for endogenous anandamide ligands. It is densely expressed in brain circuits likely to be important for both the reward and mnemonic processes important for addiction. Altered drug effects in CB1/Cnr1 knockout mice and initial association studies also make variants at the CB1/Cnr1 locus candidates for roles in human vulnerabilities to addictions. However, many features of this gene's structure, regulation and variation remain poorly defined. This poor definition has limited the ability of previous association studies to adequately sample variation at this locus. We now report improved definition of the human CB1/Cnr1 locus and its variants. Novel exons 1-3, splice variant and candidate promoter region sequences add to the richness of the CB1/Cnr1 locus. Candidate promoter region sequences confer reporter gene expression in cells that express CB1/Cnr1. Common polymorphisms reveal patterns of linkage disequilibrium in European- and in African-American individuals. A 5' CB1/Cnr1 \"TAG\" haplotype displays significant allelic frequency differences between substance abusers and controls in European-American, African-American and Japanese samples. Post-mortem brain samples of heterozygous individuals contain less mRNA transcribed from the TAG alleles than from other CB1/Cnr1 haplotypes.

A recent study reported that alterations in the 5-HT2A-mGluR2 complex may be involved in neural transmission in the schizophrenic cortex. In addition, methamphetamine-induced psychosis is thought to be similar to schizophrenia. Therefore, we conducted a case-control study with Japanese samples (738 schizophrenia patients, 196 methamphetamine-induced psychosis patients, and 802 controls) to evaluate the association and interaction between GRM2, HTR2A and schizophrenia. We selected three 'tagging SNPs' in GRM2, and two biologically functional SNPs in HTR2A (T102C and A1438G), for the association analysis. We detected a significant association between methamphetamine-induced psychosis and GRM2 in a haplotype-wise analysis, but not HTR2A. We did not detect an association between GRM2 or HTR2A and schizophrenia. In addition, no interactions of GRM2 and HTR2A were found in methamphetamine-induced psychosis or schizophrenia. We did not detect any novel polymorphisms in GRM2 when we performed a mutation search using methamphetamine-induced psychosis samples.

We analyzed the associations between SVR to PEG-IFN\u03b1-RBV therapy and two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NOS2A. This study included Taiwanese Chinese patients infected with either HCV-1 (n\u2009=\u2009265) or HCV-2 (n\u2009=\u2009195) with or without a SVR. Among the NOS2A SNPs examined, the combination of genotypes A/A and A/G of rs2248814 was inversely correlated with SVR in patients infected with HCV-1 (P\u2009=\u20090.0048), particularly in males (P\u2009=\u20090.0281).

{"abstract": "The distribution of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the human genome has important consequences for the design of experiments that infer susceptibility genes for complex disease using association studies. Recent studies have shown a non-random distribution of human meiotic recombination associated with intervening tracts of LD. Little is known about the processes, patterns and frequency of reciprocal meiotic recombination in humans. However, this phenomenon can be better understood by the fine structure analysis of several genomic regions by mapping hotspots and characterizing regions with variable LD. Here, we report clustered hotspot activity with intervening blocks of LD within the human PGM1 gene (1p31) using data derived from meiotic and population studies. Earlier work has suggested a high recombination rate in two regions within the PGM1 gene, site A (exons 4-8) and site B (exons 1A-4). Sequencing of eight individuals across 6 kb of targeted regions in site B identified 18 informative SNPs. Individuals from three distinct populations, Caucasian (n=264), Chinese (n=222) and Vietnamese (n=187), were genotyped, and haplotypes were determined using estimate of haplotypes, ldmax and Arlequin. Allelic association and haplotype analysis in these samples revealed variable recombination rates across PGM1, demonstrating the presence of: (i) three hotspots and (ii) three haplotype blocks. The spatial arrangement of haplotype blocks was identical in all populations studied. The pattern of association within PGM1 represents a region decomposed into small blocks of LD, where increased recombination activity has disrupted the ancestral chromosome.

Genetic relationships among these isolates were deduced from the distribution of large genomic deletions, which were identified by DNA microarray and confirmed by PCR and sequence analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of these deletions indicates that they are unique event polymorphisms and that horizontal gene transfer is extremely rare in M. tuberculosis. In conjunction with the epidemiological data, phylogenies reveal three large phylogeographic regions. A host's region of origin is predictive of the strain of tuberculosis he or she carries, and this association remains strong even when transmission takes place in a cosmopolitan urban center outside of the region of origin.

A novel single nucleotide insertion polymorphism was found in a guanine triplet at 108 bp upstream of the translation start site. The G insertion allele (G4 allele) was found to be common in the Japanese population, at a frequency of 0.50. The prevalence of G3 homozygotes was higher in IDDM patients (35%) and lower in NIDDM patients (17%) than in normal control subjects (28%, p=0.049).

{"abstract": "Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis in childhood; its etiology is unknown. The possibility that KD is an infectious disease has been discussed and investigated for decades, in light of the implication that infections are involved in the pathogenesis of KD. Young children rely on their innate immune system for protection against virus and micro-organisms. Human mannose binding lectin (MBL) is a C-type serum lectin synthesized by the liver as an acute phase protein and it plays an important role in the innate immune system. Here, we investigate the relationship between the MBL gene polymorphisms and the occurrence of KD in the Japanese population. The frequencies of the genotypes, defined as mutations in codons 52, 54 and 57, and the functional promoter variants of the MBL were determined in 45 patients with KD. The MBL codon-54 polymorphism frequency of heterozygote (GGC/GAC) and promoter variants were significantly higher in the KD group than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Neither group showed codon 52 nor 57 polymorphisms. It is possible that mutations of the MBL gene might be related to the trigger of the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease.", "title": "Association of mannose-binding lectin gene polymorphisms with Kawasaki disease in the Japanese.", "pmid": "20374367", "id": "969"},

{"abstract": "Although many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified to be associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS), there was only a slight improvement in the ability to predict future MetS by the simply addition of SNPs to clinical risk markers. To improve the ability to predict future MetS, combinational effects, such as SNP-SNP interaction, SNP-environment interaction, and SNP-clinical parameter (SNP \u00d7 CP) interaction should be also considered. We performed a case-control study to explore novel SNP \u00d7 CP interactions as risk markers for MetS based on health check-up data of Japanese male employees. We selected 99 SNPs that were previously reported to be associated with MetS and components of MetS; subsequently, we genotyped these SNPs from 360 cases and 1983 control subjects. First, we performed logistic regression analyses to assess the association of each SNP with MetS. Of these SNPs, five SNPs were significantly associated with MetS (P < 0.05): LRP2 rs2544390, rs1800592 between UCP1 and TBC1D9, APOA5 rs662799, VWF rs7965413, and rs1411766 between MYO16 and IRS2. Furthermore, we performed multiple logistic regression analyses, including an SNP term, a CP term, and an SNP \u00d7 CP interaction term for each CP and SNP that was significantly associated with MetS.

We evaluated the association between MPO G-463A polymorphism and the prevalence of proteinuria and estimated GFR (eGFR) in 1448 Japanese type 2 diabetic subjects. The prevalence of macroalbuminuria was higher as the number of G alleles increased (GG (7.6%), GA (3.8%), AA (0.0%), p for trend=0.0269).

Because the HLA class III genes such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or the fourth component of complement (C4) are localized in the proximity of the HLA-B locus, one or more of these genes might be responsible for susceptibility to DPB. To analyze the role of HLA class III genes in DPB patients, we first evaluated the HLA-B54 association in 32 patients with DPB, and subsequently, studied the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the TNF-alpha and -beta (TNF-alpha/beta) genes as well as the C4A and B (C4A/B) genes in DPB patients and normal individuals. The HLA-B54 antigen was significantly more frequent in DPB patients than in normal individuals (40.3% vs 13.0%, p < 0.001), however, we did not detect a significant association between DPB and gene polymorphisms of either TNF-alpha/beta or C4A/B.

We identified 14 genes, nine down-regulated and five up-regulated upon E6 D25E expression, compared with wild-type E6 expression.

{"abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to identify genetic variants which confer susceptibility to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in high- or low-risk subjects defined by conventional risk factors separately. The study population comprised 2828 Japanese individuals, including 434 subjects with CKD [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)  or =60 ml/min/ 1.73 m(2)). The 1012 high-risk subjects had both hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and the 1816 low-risk subjects had none of these conditions. The genotypes for 296 polymorphisms of 202 candidate genes were determined. The Chi-square test, multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for covariates, as well as a stepwise forward selection procedure revealed that ten different polymorphisms were associated (P<0.05) with the prevalence of CKD in high- or low-risk subjects: the -519Aright curved arrow G polymorphism of MMP1, the 1061Aright curved arrow G (Ile405Val) polymorphism of CETP, the Aright curved arrow G (Lys45Glu) polymorphism of MMP3, the -219Gright curved arrow T polymorphism of APOE, the Aright curved arrow G (Ile1205Val) polymorphism of COL3A1, the -863Cright curved arrow A polymorphism of TNF, and the 1454Cright curved arrow G (Leu125Val) polymorphism of PECAM1 in high-risk subjects; and the 1167Cright curved arrow T (Asn389Asn) polymorphism of TGFBR2, the 2386Aright curved arrow G (Ile796Val) polymorphism of SCAP, and the TAAAright curved arrow del polymorphism of PDE4D in low-risk subjects. Among these polymorphisms, the -519Aright curved arrow G polymorphism of MMP1 and the 1167Cright curved arrow T (Asn389Asn) polymorphism of TGFBR2 were most significantly associated with CKD in high- or low-risk individuals, respectively.

Recently, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR C677T and A1298C) mutations were discovered to be associated with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), as well as colon cancer, lymphoma, esophageal and stomach cancer. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the MTHFR polymorphisms are associated with the risk of childhood ALL in the Korean population. DNA samples taken from 66 patients with ALL and 100 age-matched controls were analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay for detection of MTHFR C677T and A1298C mutations. The frequency of the AC genotype for MTHFR A1298C polymorphism was significantly different between the controls and the cases (OR, 2.22; CI, 95% 1.09-4.51, p=0.03). The 1298AC+CC genotype was also significantly different (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.06-4.22; p=0.049). There was, however, no significant difference for MTHFR C677T polymorphism and combined genotype frequencies between the two groups.

We screened germline mutations of GADD45A in 185 non-BRCA1/2 familial breast cancer patients, but no deleterious mutation was found. Seven single-nucleotide-polymorphisms were identified in a subsample. Five common variants (minor allele frequency > 10%) were genotyped for association analyses to scrutinize the relationship between breast cancer and polymorphisms in GADD45A in two independent population sets (total n = 1,861). In the first case-control study (n = 1,457, cases 820, controls 637), a comparison of genotype frequencies between sporadic breast cancer patients and controls indicated the CT/TT-genotypes of +1506C>T and CG/CC-genotypes of +3204G>C were associated with decreased breast cancer risk (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 0.77; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.62-0.96; and adjusted OR, 0.71; 95%CI, 0.57-0.88, respectively) compared with their wild-type homozygotes.

To further investigate the variants and haplotypes of the EDNRB gene, this study examined sequence variations in Korean patients with sporadic HSCR. All 8 exons and intron/exon boundaries of the EDNRB gene in 18 Korean patients with sporadic HSCR and 84 healthy individuals were screened using PCR amplification and direct sequencing. A total of 8 different nucleotide substitutions were identified. Of these, 4 were new variants (promoter-116C>T; 5'UTR-121G>T; IVS4+62C>A; IVS5+121G>C) and the others were previously described variants. The distribution of variations was even different from that reported for Chinese and Japanese subjects as well as other ethnic groups.

Up to now, there has been only one systematic review focusing on this topic. We obtained some different findings compared with the previously published literature. Nineteen case-control studies were identified through a search of multiple electronic databases (from January 1, 1999 to June 30, 2011). The pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using codominant, dominant, and recessive genetic models from meta-analysis were the main outcome measure. The Harbord test was used to detect the publication bias for each group. Eighteen identified articles met the eligibility criteria. Through overall analyses, no statistical association was found between polymorphisms of the four gene loci and periodontitis. However, based on subgroup analyses, a significant association between the Taq-I variants and CP rather than AP was shown in Asians (OR = 0.590; 95% CI = 0.425, 0.818) but not in whites (OR = 0.823; 95% CI = 0.637, 1.063).

These results have not been confirmed by other reports from different geographical areas. Since HCV genotypes have a heterogeneous geographical distribution, we have determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism the genotypes of 39 HCV-seropositive Italian patients with oral LP in order to establish whether the association between LP and HCV infection is influenced by HCV subtype. Of the 33 (84.6%) viraemic patients, 17 (51%) were infected by HCV subtype 1b, 9 (27%) were infected by HCV subtype 2a, 2 by subtype 1a and 1 by subtype 2b. In four cases the gel patterns were uninterpretable. This distribution of HCV genotypes is similar to that reported in recent studies of Italian HCV-seropositive patients of unknown LP status.

In this report we present a comparative genomic analysis of these 2 genes in 4 species belonging to the family Canidae - the dog and 3 species which are kept in captivity for fur production, i.e. red fox, arctic fox and Chinese raccoon dog. We cytogenetically mapped these 2 loci by FISH and compared the entire coding sequence of INSIG2 and a fragment of the coding sequence of FTO. The FTO gene was assigned to the following chromosomes: CFA2q25 (dog), VVU2q21 (red fox), ALA8q25 (arctic fox) and NPP10q24-25 (Chinese raccoon dog), while the INSIG2 was mapped to CFA19q17, VVU5p14, ALA24q15 and NPP9q22, respectively. Altogether, 29 SNPs were identified (16 in INSIG2 and 13 in FTO) and among them 2 were missense substitutions in the dog (23C/T, Thr>Met in the FTO gene and 40C/A, Arg>Ser in INSIG2). The distribution of these 2 SNPs was studied in 14 dog breeds. Two synonymous SNPs, one in the FTO gene (-28T>C in the 5'-flanking region) and one in the INSIG2 (10175C>T in intron 2), were used for the association studies in red foxes (n = 390) and suggestive evidence was observed for their association with body weight (FTO, p < 0.08) and weight of raw skin (INSIG2, p < 0.05).

We have evaluated this theory by performing both genetic and protein expression analyses. A family based association test of AKT1 did not show association with schizophrenia in Japanese subjects. The expression levels of total AKT, AKT1 and phosphorylated GSK3beta detected in the schizophrenic brains from two different brain banks also failed to support the theory. In addition, no attenuated AKT-GSK3beta signaling was observed in the lymphocytes from Japanese schizophrenics, contrasting with previous findings. Importantly, we found that the level of phosphorylated GSK3beta at Ser9 tended to be inversely correlated with postmortem intervals, and that the phosphorylation levels of AKT were inversely correlated with brain pH, issues not assessed in the previous study. These data introduce a note of caution when estimating the phosphorylation levels of GSK3beta and AKT in postmortem brains.

Data on the Oriental populations are very limited. Therefore, the current study was performed on the Chinese population of Hong Kong, where the incidence of Hodgkin's disease is low and EBV seroconversion occurs early in life. Twenty-three consecutive samples of Hodgkin's disease collected from 18 male and five female patients over a 12-year period were studied. The first age peak occurred in the second decade of life, and the second peak in the seventh decade. Using the sensitive and specific EBV-encoded RNAs (EBERs) in situ localization technique, positive labeling of the Reed-Sternberg cells and their variants was detected in five of five samples (100%) of mixed cellularity, nine of 16 samples (56%) of nodular sclerosing, one of one sample (100%) of lymphocyte depleted, and none of one sample (0%) of nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's disease. Further analysis of the data by age group yielded the following results: four of five (80%) for age younger than 15 years, three of nine (33%) for age 15 to 49, and eight of nine (89%) for age 50 or higher, confirming the reported strong association of EBV with Hodgkin's disease at the extremes of life. The overall positivity rate was 65%, which was intermediate between that reported in the Western populations and that in the Third World countries. These findings can be explained by the epidemiological pattern of Hodgkin's disease in Hong Kong, in which the first age peak is left-shifted to a younger age compared with that of Western populations (but not as early as that observed in Third World countries), moving the peak toward an age bracket in which Hodgkin's disease shows stronger association with EBV.", "title": "Detection of Epstein-Barr virus in Hodgkin's disease occurring in an Oriental population.", "pmid": "7890284", "id": "1002"},

A novel locus at chromosome 20p11.21 represented by rs2207173 with minor allele frequency (MAF) 0.29, [\u03b2=-0.13, p=4.47\u00d710(-9)] between FOXA2 and SSTR4 was identified to be associated with 25(OH)D levels. Another suggestive association signal at rs11586313 (MAF 0.54) [\u03b2=0.90; p=1.36\u00d710(-6)] was found within the regulatory region of the IVL gene on chromosome 1q21.3. Additionally, our study replicated 3 of 5 known GWAS genes associated with 25(OH)D concentrations including GC (p=0.007) and CYP2R1 (p=0.019) reported in Europeans and the DAB1 (p=0.003), reported in Hispanics. Identification of novel association signals in biologically plausible regions with 25(OH)D metabolism will provide new molecular insights on genetic drivers of vitamin D status and its implications in health disparities.

{"abstract": "Catechol-O-methyltransferase, which has a functional genetic polymorphism, plays an important role in dopamine metabolism. The study analyzed the association between the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene polymorphism and alcohol dependence in the Korean population. Ninety-seven male alcoholics and 94 male age-matched normal controls were enrolled in this study. Polymerase chain reaction-based genotyping was used to verify the presence of the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene polymorphism. The patients were divided into two subtypes (violent group and non-violent group) according to their history of violent behavior. No difference in the distribution of the catechol-O-methyltransferase genotypes (H/H, H/L, L/L) and alleles (H, L) was observed between the patients and the controls. However, the differences between the violent and non-violent groups were significant in terms of the frequencies of the COMT genotypes (chi=7.977, df=2, P=0.019) and the alleles (chi=6.832, df=1, P=0.012). In addition, significant differences in the frequencies of the catechol-O-methyltransferase allele (chi=4.481, df=1, P=0.040) were observed between the non-violent group and the controls. This suggests that the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene polymorphism is not associated with the development of alcohol dependence, but may affect the susceptibility to a clinical heterogeneity of alcohol dependence, at least in the Korean population.", "title": "Association study of catechol-O-methyltransferase gene polymorphism in Korean male alcoholics.", "pmid": "15900232", "id": "1005"},

Genotyping was completed using the chip-based matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Allelic associations were analysed using contingency tables. In the meta-analysis, up to 2748 cases and 2774 controls from seven different studies and the new Chinese study were combined using Review Manager software version 5.1.1. Mantel-Haenszel or Inverse Variance test was used to calculate fixed or random-effects pooled ORs. In the new Chinese study, strong association with AS was observed for marker rs10050860, rs27434 and rs1065407 at P value of <0.001. Moderate association was observed for rs30187 at P value of <0.01, while no association was observed for rs27044 (P = 0.37) and rs2287987 (P = 0.23). The meta-analysis showed that rs27037 and rs30187 were strongly associated with AS (P < 0.00001). Significant association was also observed for rs27434 (P = 0.001).

{"abstract": "Despite long-term clinical experience with docetaxel, unpredictable severe adverse reactions remain an important determinant for limiting the use of the drug. To identify a genetic factor(s) determining the risk of docetaxel-induced leukopenia/neutropenia, we selected subjects who received docetaxel chemotherapy from samples recruited at BioBank Japan, and conducted a case-control association study. We genotyped 84 patients, 28 patients with grade 3 or 4 leukopenia/neutropenia, and 56 with no toxicity (patients with grade 1 or 2 were excluded), for a total of 79 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in seven genes possibly involved in the metabolism or transport of this drug: CYP3A4, CYP3A5, ABCB1, ABCC2, SLCO1B3, NR1I2, and NR1I3. Since one SNP in ABCB1, four SNPs in ABCC2, four SNPs in SLCO1B3, and one SNP in NR1I2 showed a possible association with the grade 3 leukopenia/neutropenia (P-value of <0.05), we further examined these 10 SNPs using 29 additionally obtained patients, 11 patients with grade 3/4 leukopenia/neutropenia, and 18 with no toxicity.

A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) linked two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), rs2294008C>T and rs2976392G>A, to risk of diffuse-type of gastric cancer in Japanese and Korean populations. We hypothesized that these two SNPs are also associated with risk of gastric cancer in Chinese population. We examined genotypes and haplotypes of PSCA, rs2294008C/T and rs2976392G/A in 716 patients with cardia gastric carcinoma (CGC), 1020 patients with noncardia gastric carcinoma (NCGC), and 1020 controls.

Stratification analysis showed that the increased risk associated with the SNPs was restricted in female subjects. Moreover, the rs2294008T and rs2976392A allele carriers were predisposed to developing poorly differentiated and high stage NCGC at diagnosis. However, no such association was detected for CGC.

The participants were 1012 Japanese men and women (40 to 59 years of age). Their weight at 18 years old was obtained from a questionnaire. Weight change was defined as the current weight minus the weight at 18 years old. Subjects were grouped into four categories by these genotypes: W/W=noncarriers, W/H=Arg64 carriers of the beta3-AR, H/W=T (n-128) or G (n-81) carriers of the CCK1R, H/H=T (n-128) or G (n-81) and Arg64 carriers. In men, the interaction between the CCK1R and beta3-AR polymorphisms was significant (two-way ANOVA, p < 0.05), but neither the CCK1R nor the beta3-AR was individually associated with weight gain. The H/H group showed a higher possibility of weight gain of 10 kg or more compared with the W/W group in men. The odds ratio for weight gain (> or =10 kg) of H/H was 2.54 (95% confidence interval: 1.50 to 4.30) compared with W/W. In women, neither main effect nor interaction was significant.

{"abstract": "Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are widely used as maintenance regimens for asthma patients. However, response to ICS shows marked inter-individual variability. Genetic factors have been shown to be potential predictors of responsiveness to ICS. We aimed to evaluate those pharmacogenetic effects on asthma control in further detail. Fifty-three mild-to-moderate asthmatics were genotyped for four genetic polymorphisms of four genes: beta2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2), adenylate cyclase 9 (ADCY9), neurokinin receptor 2 (NK2R) and T-box 21 (TBX21). The principal clinical outcome was the achievement of asthma control, as assessed using the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines. During treatment with ICS, the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)), maximal mid-expiratory flow (MMEF) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were monitored every 4 weeks and twice daily. Forty-eight of the 53 patients with asthma were in a controlled or partly controlled state after 12 weeks of treatment with ICS, whereas five asthmatics were in an uncontrolled state even after active treatment. Of the four genetic polymorphisms examined, NK2R G231E G>A and TBX21 H33Q C>G were significantly associated with asthma control status (P = 0.041 and P = 0.006). The subjects with wild-type alleles at each polymorphism showed a significant association with the well-controlled or partly controlled state, as compared to those with mutant alleles. At 5-12 weeks after ICS treatment, the NK2R G231E G>A was associated with therapeutic response to ICS, as reflected by improvement in predicted FEV(1)%.

{"abstract": "To examine the entire HLA region for loci (other than the DRB1 locus) associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility, by typing HLA-DRB1 alleles and multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Japanese population. The HLA-DRB1 alleles and 88 SNPs distributed over the HLA gene complex were genotyped, for 828 patients with RA and 1,032 control subjects. The data were evaluated for linkage disequilibrium, and case-control associations were analyzed in 2 ways, in the presence or absence of the disease-susceptibility DRB1 allele, to detect loci independent of the DRB1 allele. HLA-DRB1 alleles *0405, *0401, *0901, *0101, *1401, *1602, *0403, and *1405 were significantly associated with RA in the Japanese population. The smallest P value (P = 1.4 x 10(-27)) was observed in association with an intronic SNP of the NOTCH4 gene, which was due to strong linkage disequilibrium with the HLA-DRB1 allele. A strong association that was independent of HLA-DRB1 shared epitope alleles was observed in 2 SNPs: one in the intron of the MICA gene, the other in the intron of the HLA-DQB2 gene. Their association with RA, independent of HLA-DRB1 shared epitope alleles, was suggestive (P = 0.0024 [corrected P (P(corr)) = 0.068, and P = 0.00037 [P(corr) = 0.012], respectively).

CAD patients were subdivided into 2 groups; those patients treated without lipid-lowering drug (LLD) (n = 173) and those treated with LLD (n = 353). No significant differences existed between the 2 groups in age, body mass index, blood pressure, serum glucose, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and the proportions of antihypertensive and antiplatelet therapies.

Recently, a -521C/T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the promoter region of the DRD4 gene was found to be related to Novelty Seeking scores in populations from Japan and Hungary. Since little is known about the role DRD4 plays in personality in other populations we evaluated if two DRD4 promoter SNPs, -521C/T and -616C/G, were related to personality traits in African Americans. Personality traits were measured by the NEO-FFI in 71 unrelated African Americans. Genotyping was performed using PCR-RFLP. Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) were performed to evaluate the effects of gender and -616 and -521 genotypes on personality traits. A significant three-way interaction effect from gender, -616 genotype, and -521 genotype was observed for Extraversion scores (F(1,54) 5.86, P < 0.02).

Data for such studies is available for two East Asian countries, Japan and China, and the association in both cases is different. Further, among the Japanese population too, there are discrepant results. It was therefore important to analyze such an association in the Indian population, belonging to Southern Asia.

A GWAS was conducted with 945 patients with clinically defined gout and 1213 controls in a Japanese male population, followed by replication study of 1048 clinically defined cases and 1334 controls. Five gout susceptibility loci were identified at the genome-wide significance level (p<5.0\u00d710(-8)), which contained well-known urate transporter genes (ABCG2 and SLC2A9) and additional genes: rs1260326 (p=1.9\u00d710(-12); OR=1.36) of GCKR (a gene for glucose and lipid metabolism), rs2188380 (p=1.6\u00d710(-23); OR=1.75) of MYL2-CUX2 (genes associated with cholesterol and diabetes mellitus) and rs4073582 (p=6.4\u00d710(-9); OR=1.66) of CNIH-2 (a gene for regulation of glutamate signalling).

Carrying rs1042718 or rs1042719 minor alleles is significantly and negatively associated with negative emotion, but the ADRB2 SNPs are not significantly associated with cognitive function and self-reported health.

The association between targeted SNPs and AMD was then analyzed by codominant, dominant, recessive, and allelic models.The genotyping data of rs12778366, rs3740051, and rs4746720 revealed significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium tests in the AMD group but not in the control group.We detected significantly differences of rs12778366 allele distribution between 2 groups in recessive and codominant model (P\u200a<\u200a0.05).

{"abstract": "Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is a reproductive problem that occurs in women in reproductive age with a frequency of 1-3 per cent. Previous studies have reported high levels of serum androgens to be associated with RSAs. At the molecular level, the effect of androgens is mediated through the activation of the androgen receptor (AR). The CAG and GGN repeat polymorphisms of the AR gene are associated with the AR activity. We hypothesize that the AR CAG/GGN repeat polymorphism may be associated with levels of serum androgens. Thus, this study as undertaken to evaluate the relationship between CAG/GGN repeats in exon 1 of the AR gene in women with RSAs. This case-control study was performed in Ningxia, PR China, including 149 women with RSAs and 210 controls. The CAG and GGN repeats of the AR gene were genotyped using a PCR-based assay and were analyzed using Peak Scanner Software v1.0 to determine the CAG/GGN repeat length. CAG repeats ranged from 15 to 29 in the RSA patients, compared to 14 to 35 in the control group. The median value of CAG repeats was 22 for the RSA group and 24 for control group. The total AR CAG alleles (\u226422 repeats), shorter AR CAG alleles (\u226422 repeats), and biallelic means (\u226422.5 repeats) were significantly different in the RSA group in comparison to the control group ( P <0.001, P <0.01). The median value of the GGN repeats was 23 for the cases and 22 for controls. The total number of AR GGN alleles (\u226423 repeats) was significantly different in the RSA group compared to the control group ( P <0.5). There was no difference between the RSA group and the control groups in regards to shorter alleles, longer alleles, and biallelic means. Our observation suggests that the CAG and GGN repeat length is shorter in women with RSAs as compared with controls and that shorter CAG and GGN repeats may be pathogenic for RSAs in Chinese women.

{"abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and numerous carcinogens may cause DNA damage including oxidative base lesions that contribute to the risk of lung cancer. The base excision repair (BER) pathway could effectively remove oxidative lesions in which 8-oxoguanine glycosylase-1 (OGG1), x-ray repair cross-complementing 1 (XRCC1), and apurinic/apyimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) play key roles. The aim of this study was to analyze the polymorphisms of DNA BER genes (OOG1, XRCC1 and APE1) and explore their associations, and the combined effects of these variants, with risk of lung cancer. In a hospital-based, case-control study of 455 lung cancer cases and 443 cancer-free hospital controls, the SNPs of OGG1 (Ser326Cys), XRCC1 (Arg399Gln), APE1 (Asp148Glu and -141T/G) were genotyped and analyzed for their correlation with the risk of lung cancer in multivariate logistic regression models. Individuals homozygous for the variants APE1 -141GG showed a protective effect for lung cancer overall (OR=0.62; 95% CI: 0.42-0.91; p=0.02) and for lung adenocarcinoma (OR=0.65; 95% CI, 0.44-0.96; p=0.03). When analyzing the combined effects of variant alleles, 84 patients and controls were identified who were homozygous for two or three of the potential protective alleles (i.e., OGG1 326Cys, XRCC1 399Gln and APE1 -141G). ORs were significantly reduced when all patients were analyzed (OR=0.62; 95% CI: 0.38-0.99; p=0.05).

The size of the scotoma depends on the lesion size of the choroidal neovascular membrane and significantly affects the patient's quality of life, and the lesion size of neovascularization also affects response to treatments. The aim of this study was to identify genes associated with the neovascular lesion size in neovascular AMD. A genome-wide association study (GWAS). We included 1146 Japanese patients with neovascular AMD. We performed a 2-stage GWAS for the lesion size of AMD as a quantitative trait among 1146 (first stage: 727, second stage: 419) Japanese patients with neovascular AMD. Lesion size was determined by the greatest linear dimension measured with fluorescein angiography examination before treatment. We examined the association between the genotypic distribution of each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and the trait using an additive model adjusted for age and sex. To evaluate the associations between AMD development and SNPs associated with lesion size, we also performed a case-control study by using the genotype data from these 1146 Japanese patients as case subjects and the fixed dataset from the Nagahama Study as control subjects. Genes associated with the lesion size in neovascular AMD. In the discovery stage, rs10895322 in MMP20 showed a genome-wide significant P value of 6.95\u00d710(-8), and rs2284665 in ARMS2/HTRA1 showed a P value of 1.55\u00d710(-7).

A 1:2 frequency-matched case control study of 285 patients and 570 controls was conducted from June 2010 to May 2011 in AnXi of Fujian province, China. Environmental factors were investigated using a self-administered questionnaire and genotypes were determined using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism based methods. Unconditional logistic regression models were used for statistical evaluation. Current or former smoking, consumption of pickled vegetables or hot beverages/food, having a first degree relative with ESCC and history of reflux esophagitis were significantly associated with increased ESCC risk, whereas tea drinking and consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits were significantly associated with decreased risk. The CYP2C19*2 GA/AA genotype was significantly more prevalent in ESCC patients and individuals with at least one copy of the CYP2C19*2 A allele had a 3.19-fold increased risk (adjusted 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.21-4.61, P\u2009<\u20090.001) of ESCC compared with those without this allele.

The predose and 2-h postdose concentrations of CsA (C(0) and C(2), respectively) were determined by fluorescence polarization immunoassay, and their relationships with corresponding genotypes and haplotypes were investigated. Patients with a CYP3A4*1/*1 genotype were found to have a higher dose-adjusted concentration compared with those with CYP3A4*18B/*18B, as follows: for C(2), 19.3% (P = 0.008) during days 8-15, 35.2% (P = 0.008) during days 16-30, and for C(0), 39.7% (P = 0.012) during days 16-30. The dose-adjusted C(0) was higher in patients with MDR1 1236CC compared with those with 1236TT in the first month postoperation.

To identify the genetic marker for diabetic nephropathy, we examined the association between the (A-C)n dinucleotide repeat polymorphism upstream of the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) gene and diabetic nephropathy in a group of Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients were divided into three groups based on their urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) and the stage of diabetic retinopathy as follows: uncomplicated group (U), normal albuminuria (AER  or = 200 microg/min (N = 63). The region containing the dinucleotide repeat upstream of MMP-9 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplified products were analyzed with 7% formamide/urea acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The promoter constructs of the MMP-9 gene were transfected with the CMV-beta-galactosidase construct into 293 cells using the liposome method. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were harvested, and luciferase and beta-galactosidase activities were measured. Nine alleles of the dinucleotide repeat polymorphism (17 to 25 repeats) were identified, and the frequency of each allele in diabetic subjects was not different from that in nondiabetic controls. The frequency of the allele containing 21 repeats (A21) was most abundant (42.4% in control and 45.6% in diabetic subjects), followed by the allele with 23 repeats (A23; 35.4% in control and 27.6% in diabetic subjects). The A21 allele was less frequent in M and O than U (O, 38.9%; M, 45.5%; U, 59.3%, chi2 = 7.18; P < 0.05, O vs. U), while the frequency of the alleles other than A21 was not different among each group. The calculated odds ratio for nephropathy in the noncarrier, heterozygote, or homozygote of A21 allele was 3.38, 1.97, and 0.2, respectively. Furthermore, the promoter assay for the MMP-9 gene revealed that the A21 allele had a higher promoter activity compared with other alleles. No significant correlation was observed between serum MMP-9 concentrations and the MMP-9 gene polymorphism.

In addition, to low production of Th2 cytokines, strong Th1 response, which plays an important role in vitiligo development, has been induced by blockade of TSLP or TSLP receptor. This study examined whether a functional TSLP polymorphism was associated with vitiligo. One hundred and sixty Korean patients with vitiligo and 568 healthy Korean individuals were examined for the four SNPs of TSLP gene. Luciferase activity was measured for promoter assay. The genotype and allele frequencies of -847C>T polymorphism were lower in vitiligo patients compared with the controls, whereas those of wild type were higher (P = 0.004, P = 0.017 respectively). None the less, the promoter activity of -847C decreased significantly (P = 0.013) compared with -847T, expecting lower TSLP mRNA levels in the polymorphism.

In 2000, Witt et al. first recognized the association between mutations in the SPINK1 gene and chronic pancreatitis (CP), but the significance of SPINK1 gene mutation in pancreatitis and its relation to alcohol consumption remains unclear in Japan. The aim of the present paper was to clarify the incidence of SPINK1 mutations in CP patients with various etiologies in Japan and, in addition, to examine the relationship between alcohol metabolism and the polymorphisms in the key enzymes, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2). A total of 156 patients with CP, and 165 healthy volunteers, all Japanese, were examined for the SPINK1 mutations by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and direct sequencing. In Japan, the prevalence of [N34S; IVS1-37T > C] and [-215G > A; IVS3 + 2T > C] was significantly higher in patients with idiopathic CP (10.6% and 12.8%, respectively) than normal subjects (0.6% and 0%). The frequency of the [-215G > A; IVS3 + 2T > C] mutation in Japan was significantly higher than that reported in other populations. Concerning alcoholic CP, the [-215G > A; IVS3 + 2T > C] mutation was found in only a small number of patients (3.9%). On analysis of ADH2 and ALDH2 gene polymorphisms an association was found between ADH2*2 allele and alcoholic CP, and the ADH2*2/2*2 genotype had a tendency to increase the risk of developing pancreatic pseudocyst.

{"abstract": "Gene mutations and reassortment are key mechanisms by which influenza A virus acquires virulence factors. To evaluate the role of the viral polymerase replication machinery in producing virulent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza viruses, we generated various polymerase point mutants (PB2, 627K/701N; PB1, expression of PB1-F2 protein; and PA, 97I) and reassortant viruses with various sources of influenza viruses by reverse genetics. Although the point mutations produced no significant change in pathogenicity, reassortment between the pandemic A/California/04/09 (CA04, H1N1) and current human and animal influenza viruses produced variants possessing a broad spectrum of pathogenicity in the mouse model. Although most polymerase reassortants had attenuated pathogenicity (including those containing seasonal human H3N2 and high-pathogenicity H5N1 virus segments) compared to that of the parental CA04 (H1N1) virus, some recombinants had significantly enhanced virulence. Unexpectedly, one of the five highly virulent reassortants contained a A/Swine/Korea/JNS06/04(H3N2)-like PB2 gene with no known virulence factors; the other four had mammalian-passaged avian-like genes encoding PB2 featuring 627K, PA featuring 97I, or both. Overall, the reassorted polymerase complexes were only moderately compatible for virus rescue, probably because of disrupted molecular interactions involving viral or host proteins. Although we observed close cooperation between PB2 and PB1 from similar virus origins, we found that PA appears to be crucial in maintaining viral gene functions in the context of the CA04 (H1N1) virus. These observations provide helpful insights into the pathogenic potential of reassortant influenza viruses composed of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus and prevailing human or animal influenza viruses that could emerge in the future.", "title": "Virulence and genetic compatibility of polymerase reassortant viruses derived from the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus and circulating influenza A viruses.", "pmid": "21507962", "id": "1080"},

Both the Ryk-deficient mouse and Ephb2/Ephb3 (genes for interaction molecules with RYK) double-mutant mouse show cleft palate. Mutation searches for RYK, EPHB2, and EPHB3 were carried out in a large number of Japanese and Vietnamese patients with cleft lip and/or palate and cleft palate only. Case-control study and transmission disequilibrium tests were performed also, using three single nucleotide polymorphisms within a linkage disequilibrium block in RYK. Seven haplotypes were constructed from the single nucleotide polymorphisms. A missense mutation, 1355G>A (Y452C), in RYK was identified in one Vietnamese patient with cleft lip and/or palate. This mutation was not found among 1646 Vietnamese, Japanese, and Caucasians, including 354 cleft lip and/ or palate and cleft palate only patients.

The purpose of the present study was to examine a possible association of rs6929846 of BTN2A1 with dyslipidemia in community\u2011dwelling individuals. The study subjects were comprised of 5,958 community\u2011dwelling individuals (2,909 subjects with dyslipidemia and 3,049 controls) who were recruited into a population\u2011based cohort study in Inabe, Japan.

The authors examined the prevalence of the -1438A/G polymorphism of the 5HT2A receptor gene among 182 Japanese patients with EDs and 374 normal control subjects. Interactions of the association of this polymorphism with subtypes of anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and various clinical characteristics were also assessed. In contrast to previous studies reporting elevated A allele frequencies in patients with AN, the G allele had a significantly higher frequency in patients with BN but not in patients with AN, than in control subjects. Examination of the interactions revealed that the presence of the binge eating and/or purging behavior and comorbid borderline personality disorder (BPD) tended to be associated with increased frequency of the G allele.

The discriminative power of the prediction models with and without genotype scores was compared. We further meta-analyzed the association of these variants with T2DM by pooling all candidate-gene association studies conducted in Han Chinese. Five risk variants in IGF2BP2 (rs4402960, rs1470579), CDKAL1 (rs10946398), SLC30A8 (rs13266634), and HHEX (rs1111875) genes were nominally associated with T2DM in our samples.

The study was aimed to determine whether any of the four MRF2/ARID5B SNPs (rs2893880, rs10740055, rs7087507 and rs10761600) associated with susceptibility to CAD are also associated with T2D, and to determine whether SNP genotype influences the levels of adiponectin and other clinical factors. Association of MRF2/ARID5B SNPs was investigated in 500 diabetic patients from the Department of Metabolic Diseases at the University of Tokyo and 243 hospital-based nondiabetic individuals from the Institute for Adult Disease Asahi Life Foundation Hospital and 500 community-based nondiabetic individuals from the Hiroshima Atomic Bomb Casualty Council Health Management Center. Associations of haplotypes of these SNP with levels of adiponectin and other clinical factors were evaluated when the data was available. We found rs2893880C, rs10740055A, rs7087507A and rs10761600T were increasingly associated with T2D in terms of allele/genotype frequencies of each SNP and their haplotype combinations. Individuals with haplotype CAAT indicated an 1.86 times higher prevalence of diabetes compared with individuals with GCGA (OR 1.86 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43-2.41)). Furthermore, CAAT significantly associated with adiponectin levels and other clinical factors. In conclusion, polymorphisms on the MRF2/ARID5B gene were associated with susceptibility to T2D as well as adiponectin and other clinical factors, which was in a completely concordant way with their associations with CAD.", "title": "Associations of variations in the MRF2/ARID5B gene with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population.", "pmid": "22971728", "id": "1095"},

Serum biochemical parameters including uric acid concentrations were determined. All the variants were analyzed for gender differences since uric acid metabolism differed between genders. In males after adjustments for age and BMI, GCKR rs780094, SLC2A9 rs11722228 and SF1 rs606458 were associated with the uric acid concentrations, which were statistically significant (P=0.016, 0.001 and 0.03, respectively), whereas SLC2A9 rs3775948 was marginally associated with the uric acid concentrations (P=0.071). In females, SLC22A12 rs506338 was also marginally associated with the uric acid concentrations (P=0.057).

The sample included 272 patients with autism and 310 healthy controls. All the exons and the promoter region of the GLO1 gene were PCR-amplified and sequenced for mutation screening and genotyping. We did not find significant differences of allelic and genotypic frequency distributions of C419A between the autism and control groups. Moreover, we did not identify any other mutations in the exon regions associated with autism in this sample. We discovered two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the 5' untranslated region of the GLO1 gene, designated g.-264T/G and g.-7T/C; however, these two SNPs were not associated with autism in this sample. Further analysis of halplotypes constructed from these 3 SNPs (g.-264T/G, g.-7T/C, and C419A) found no haplotype associated with autism. Our sample size has the power of 0.57 and 0.94 to detect a small effect (0.1) in the genotype and allele frequency distributions at the alpha level of 0.05, respectively.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between the genetic type and alleles for the HTR1A gene in Korean children with ADHD. The sample consisted of 142 ADHD children and 139 control children. We diagnosed ADHD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-4th edition. ADHD symptoms were evaluated with Conners' Parent Rating Scales and Dupaul Parent ADHD Rating Scales. Blood samples were taken from the 281 subjects, DNA was extracted from blood lymphocytes, and polymerase chain reaction was performed for HTR1A polymorphism. Alleles and genotype frequencies were compared using the chi-square test. We compared the allele and genotype frequencies of HTR1A gene polymorphism in the ADHD and control groups. This study showed that there was a significant correlation among the frequencies of the rs10042486 (OR=1.55, 95% CI=1.02-2.30, p=0.041), rs1423691(OR=1.55, 95% CI=1.02-2.30, p=0.041),and rs878567(OR=1.60, 95% CI=1.06-2.43, p=0.027) alleles of HTR1A, but the final conclusions are not definite. Follow-up studies with larger patient or pure subgroups are expected. These results suggested that HTR1A might be related to ADHD symptoms.", "title": "Association between HTR1A gene polymorphisms and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in Korean children.", "pmid": "23308375", "id": "1114"},
{"abstract": "Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) of the uterine cervix is a rare variant of squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix. This tumor is characterized by nests of poorly differentiated epithelial cells surrounded by a prominent lymphocytic infiltration. Despite the poorly differentiated pathological findings, it appears to have a better outcome than the usual squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Therefore, it is quite important to differentiate this tumor from poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and lympho-proliferative disorders of the cervix. LELC arising from the nasopharynx has been suggested to be associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), whereas the involvement of EBV in LELC of the uterine cervix is still controversial. In addition, the role of high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) in this type of tumor remains unknown.

Analyses of the Glu298Asp polymorphism in exon 7 and VNTR polymorphism in intron 4 of the eNOS gene were made by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique and PCR genotyping, respectively. Additionally, HLA-B51 typing was performed in the BD group and controls by a two step PCR sequence-specific primers method. Significant differences in Glu298Asp genotype frequencies were found between the BD or vasculitis groups and the controls (BD group v controls: p(corr)=0.006; vasculitis group v controls: p<0.001). The Asp298 frequency was much higher in the BD and vasculitis groups than in the controls. Even after stratification of the BD group based on the results of HLA-B51 testing, a significant association of the Glu298Asp polymorphism was still found (p=0.002, Mantel-Haenszel weighted odds ratio 4.3, 95% confidence interval 1.7 to 10.9). Distribution of the genotype frequencies in two eNOS gene polymorphisms was similar in connective tissue diseases-associated vasculitis and primary vasculitic syndromes.

Genetic associations between each SNP and SSc risk, calculated as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals, were estimated using chi-square tests.

Gene-gene interactions were investigated using a recently described novel method, and the results were confirmed by conditional logistic regression. Adjustment for multiple testing was based on Bonferroni correction. There was significant evidence of gene-gene interaction between polymorphisms in the genes CXCL8 (interleukin-8) and CCL5, and both of these were associated with an increased risk of SSc. This SNP-SNP interaction was confirmed by 2 independent statistical methods. The associations remained significant after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing.

Using 24 Japanese type 2 diabetic subjects, we first screened a 9.5 kb region, which included the entire coding sequence, to assess potential functional variants of TCF7L2. Sequencing revealed a common coding variant (Pro477Thr) in exon 14 of TCF7L2 that was not enrolled in the public SNP database. Nineteen SNPs and the microsatellite DG10S478 were genotyped across the gene in 2,877 unrelated Japanese subjects. This independent screen identified the previously reported rs7903146 with a strongest association (allele P = 0.0001, odds ratio = 1.59 [95% confidence interval 1.25-2.01]), but there was no significant association between Pro477Thr and type 2 diabetes (allele P = 0.64). Expression of the Pro477Thr variant did not alter TCF7L2 expression in 30 lymphoblast cells.

Dietary patterns were constructed from food frequency questionnaire using factor analysis. Genotyping of rs1870377 and rs2071559 was performed by real-time PCR using TaqMan probes. Physical measurements: body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressures and biochemical parameters: glycated hemoglobin A1c and blood lipids (total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio) were measured. Two dietary patterns were extracted for: Japanese ('Japanese diet' and 'Western diet') and Chinese Malaysians ('Balanced diet'; and 'Meat, rice and noodles diet'). In Japanese, 'Western Diet' and rs2071559 were associated with LDL-C and HDL-C, respectively. In Chinese Malaysians, 'Meat, rice and noodles diet' was asso-ciated with triglycerides, HDL-C and total cholesterol/HDL ratio while rs1870377 and rs2071559 were associated with total cholesterol and/or LDL-C. The interaction between 'Western Diet' and rs2071559 in Japanese and 'Meat, rice and noodles diet' and rs1870377 in Malaysians had significant effects on blood lipids after adjusting for confounders. The association and interaction of dietary patterns and VEGFR2 gene polymorphisms on blood lipids differ between Chinese Malaysian and Japanese subjects by either decreasing or increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease.", "title": "Association and interaction between dietary pattern and VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) gene polymorphisms on blood lipids in Chinese Malaysian and Japanese adults.", "pmid": "22507619", "id": "1134"},

We found that CAPN10 occurs within a single block of high LD and that LD decays rapidly outside of the gene. This reduces the likelihood that associations between CAPN10 polymorphisms and type 2 diabetes could be attributed to variation at some distance from CAPN10. We also consistently observed that cases have more extensive LD than control subjects and that cases from families with evidence for linkage have more extensive LD than cases from families without evidence for linkage. These observations further suggest that there are one or more relatively common alleles increasing risk of type 2 diabetes in this local region.", "title": "Patterns of linkage disequilibrium in the type 2 diabetes gene calpain-10.", "pmid": "16306378", "id": "1135"},

Association studies in admixed populations from Northern European ancestry noted no such association between CARD15 mutations and AS. However, a homogenous population has yet to be studied. We investigated the prevalence of the 3 common CARD15 variants in a homogenous Korean population with AS. All subjects were native Koreans with AS satisfying the modified New York criteria. Korean controls were examined and confirmed to be unaffected by AS. Subjects with AS were genotyped for the R702W, G908R, and Leu1007fsinsC variants of CARD15 using mass array MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A total of 205 AS subjects and 200 controls were genotyped. No subject with AS had any variants at the 702 and 1007 sites of CARD15. Only one subject was heterozygous for the 908 variant. The overall genotype frequency in AS for any CARD15 variant was 0.5%.

However, some studies of molecular genetics have implicated that there may be an ethnic variation concerning the disease susceptibility of the AGT gene. To evaluate the importance of this candidate gene for hypertension, we undertook an extensive association study in the Japanese. This case-control study was conducted in a total of 1232 individuals consecutively enrolled in a single institution, divided into two subgroups: one subgroup comprised 254 hypertensive and 224 normotensive subjects and the other comprised 463 hypertensive and 291 normotensive subjects. A meta-analysis was subsequently performed on six Japanese studies including the present study. No significant association was observed between a molecular variant of AGT, Thr235, and hypertension status in our case-control study. Moreover, this finding was extendible to another AGT polymorphism, G-6A, one of the potential functional polymorphisms in the promoter region, because these two polymorphisms proved to be in complete linkage disequilibrium in the studied population. The meta-analysis revealed that the pooled estimate of the odds ratio across the studies was 1.22 (95% CI 1.05-1.42), and that there was significant evidence against homogeneity of the odds ratios among the studies included (phi2 = 19.8, df = 5, P = 0.0014). In particular, a large range of variation (60-83%) was found for the allele frequency of Thr235 among control subjects of the six Japanese case-control studies. Although the meta-analysis appears in favour of association between the AGT variant and essential hypertension in the Japanese, there is considerable heterogeneity among the studies and the evidence is also rather borderline.

Several genome-wide association studies have reported numerous risk factors for AD, but replication results following these studies have been controversial.

Genome-wide association analysis revealed that two chromosome regions on Chr. 4q22-q23 (ADH gene cluster, including ADH5, ADH4, ADH6, ADH1A, ADH1B, and ADH7) and Chr. 12q24 (ALDH2) showed multiple association signals for the risk of AD. To investigate detailed genetic effects of these ADH genes on AD, a follow-up study of the ADH gene cluster on 4q22-q23 was performed.

The patients ranged in age from 26 to 86 years (mean 61.5 +/- 14.6 years). Neurological deficits were classified according to the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association Scale. Mean follow-up was 18.8 +/- 4.6 months and APOE genotyping was carried out by isolation of DNA from venous blood samples.

Categorical variables were analyzed with the chi-square test, continuous data with the Mann-Whitney U-test, and for multiple groups with the Kruskal-Wallis H-test. A backward stepwise binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the effect of APOE in a multivariate model. Of the 60 patients with CSM, 35 (58.3%) improved and 25 (41.7%) did not improve or suffered deterioration (no-improvement group).

The aim of this study was to examine possible relationships between I/D polymorphisms and the myocardial release of ANP and BNP in Japanese hemodialysis (HD) patients (n=131). We studied 131 non-diabetic hemodialysis patients. The genotype of ACE gene was determined by polymerase chain reaction with a set of specific timers. ANP and BNP levels were measured before HD. The plasma levels of ANP and BNP were significantly lower in the DD genotype group compared to those in the II group. Corresponding levels in the ID genotype group were intermediate between those in the DD and II groups. ACE polymorphism was associated with neither ejection fraction nor left ventricular mass/height index (LVMI), as evidenced by echocardiographic findings (n=107). Plasma levels of ANP were significantly correlated with left atrial diameter (LAD) in patients as a whole, but this correlation was only observed in the II genotype group, and not in the DD or ID groups. Plasma levels of BNP were significantly correlated with LAD, left ventricular end systolic diameter and LVMI in patients as a whole, but these correlations were seen only in the II genotype group. The results suggest that the plasma levels of these natriuretic peptides should be evaluated on the basis of ACE polymorphism for assessing cardiac diseases due to volume overload in Japanese HD patients.", "title": "Evaluation of atrial and brain natriuretic polypeptides in association with angiotensin-converting enzyme gene polymorphism in Japanese non-diabetic hemodialysis patients.", "pmid": "17454955", "id": "1153"},
{"abstract": "Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a complex and heterogeneous disorder that is influenced by multiple genetic components. Numerous candidate gene studies designed to identify POF susceptibility loci have been published, but most positive findings have not been confirmed in follow up studies. We sought to determine if sequence variants previously associated with age at natural menopause (AANM) or early menopause (EM) contribute as well to genetic susceptibility to POF. Our study was performed on 371 unrelated idiopathic women with POF and 800 women controls, all Chinese Han. Thirty six SNPs from previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) responsible for AANM or EM and 3 additional SNPs in ESR1, and 2 additional SNPs in PTHB1 were tested using the Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX platform for genotyping. Three SNPs - rs2278493 in HK3, rs2234693 in ESR1 and rs12611091 in BRSK1 - showed nominally significant association with POF. Thus, a plausible relationship could exist between ESR1, BRSK1, HK3 and POF. This largest association study undertaken to determine correlation between POF and AANM/EM revealed three significant SNPs (rs2278493, rs2234693, and rs12611091). All are associated with not only AAWM and EM but also POF.

{"abstract": "Both schizophrenia (SCZ) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neuropsychiatric disorders with overlapping genetic etiology. Protocadherin 15 (PCDH15), which encodes a member of the cadherin super family that contributes to neural development and function, has been cited as a risk gene for neuropsychiatric disorders. Recently, rare variants of large effect have been paid attention to understand the etiopathology of these complex disorders. Thus, we evaluated the impacts of rare, single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in PCDH15 on SCZ or ASD. First, we conducted coding exon-targeted resequencing of PCDH15 with next-generation sequencing technology in 562 Japanese patients (370 SCZ and 192 ASD) and detected 16 heterozygous SNVs. We then performed association analyses on 2,096 cases (1,714 SCZ and 382 ASD) and 1,917 controls with six novel variants of these 16 SNVs. Of these six variants, four (p.R219K, p.T281A, p.D642N, c.3010-1G>C) were ultra-rare variants (minor allele frequency < 0.0005) that may increase disease susceptibility. Finally, no statistically significant association between any of these rare, heterozygous PCDH15 point variants and SCZ or ASD was found. Our results suggest that a larger sample size of resequencing subjects is necessary to detect associations between rare PCDH15 variants and neuropsychiatric disorders.

A 7-day low-sodium intervention (51.3 mmol sodium per day) followed by a 7-day high-sodium intervention (307.8 mmol sodium per day) was conducted among 1906 participants from 637 Han Chinese families. BP measurements were obtained at baseline and following each intervention using a random-zero sphygmomanometer. Twenty-three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including both tag and functional SNPs, were selected from three candidate genes (APLN, APLNR, and ACE2). Single marker and haplotype analyses were conducted using the Family Based Association Test program. The false discovery rate method was used to correct for multiple testing. SNPs rs2282623 and rs746886 of the APLNR gene were significantly associated with DBP (both P = 0.002) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) (P = 0.001 and 0.005, respectively) responses to low-sodium intervention. Six SNPs of the ACE2 gene were significantly associated with SBP, DBP, or MAP responses to low-sodium intervention. Three of them, rs1514283, rs1514282, and rs4646176, were also significantly associated with MAP response to high-sodium intervention (all P <or= 0.006). Haplotype analysis indicated the A-T-T haplotype of APLNR SNPs rs721608-rs2282623-rs746886 was associated with decreased DBP and MAP responses to low-sodium intervention (P = 0.001 and 0.003, respectively), whereas G-C-C was associated with increased SBP and MAP responses to high-sodium intervention (P = 0.004 and 0.01, respectively).

{"abstract": "Associations have been reported between the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms in the exon 3 of dopamine D4 receptor gene gene and multiple psychiatric illnesses/traits. We examined the distribution of VNTR alleles of different length in a Japanese cohort and found that, as reported earlier, the size of allele '7R' was much rarer (0.5%) in Japanese than in Caucasian populations (approximately 20%). This presents a challenge to an earlier proposed hypothesis that positive selection favoring the allele 7R has contributed to its high frequency. To further address the issue of selection, we carried out sequencing of the VNTR region not only from human but also from chimpanzee samples, and made inference on the ancestral repeat motif and haplotype by use of a phylogenetic analysis program. The most common 4R variant was considered to be the ancestral haplotype as earlier proposed. However, in a gene tree of VNTR constructed on the basis of this inferred ancestral haplotype, the allele 7R had five descendent haplotypes in relatively long lineage, where genetic drift can have major influence. We also tested this length polymorphism for association with schizophrenia, studying two Japanese sample sets (one with 570 cases and 570 controls, and the other with 124 pedigrees). No evidence of association between the allele 7R and schizophrenia was found in any of the two data sets.

The aim of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the genetic risk of COMT for schizophrenia. First, we performed a mutation scan to detect the existence of potent functional variants in the 5'-flanking and exon regions. Second, we conducted a gene-based case-control study between tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in COMT [19 SNPs including six possible functional SNPs (rs2075507, rs737865, rs4680, rs165599, rs165849)] and schizophrenia in large Japanese samples (schizophrenics 1118, controls 1100).

The purpose of this work is to specify the likelihood ratio test statistic (LRTS) for case-control sampling design based on the underlying continuous quantitative measurement, and to assess its power and relative efficiency (as compared to the chi-square test of independence on CNP counts). The sample size and power formulas of both methods are given. For the latter, the CNPs are classified using the Bayesian classification rule. The LRTS is more powerful than this chi-square test for the alternatives considered, especially alternatives in which the at-risk CNP categories have low frequencies. An example of the application of the LRTS is given for a comparison of CNP distributions in individuals of Caucasian or Taiwanese ethnicity, where the LRTS appears to be more powerful than the chi-square test, possibly due to misclassification of the most common CNP category into a less common category.", "title": "Computing power and sample size for case-control association studies with copy number polymorphism: application of mixture-based likelihood ratio test.", "pmid": "18941524", "id": "1163"},

{"abstract": "The dramatic shift in the pathological presentation of lung cancer [the proportional decrease in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and increase in adenocarcinoma (AC)] observed in the United States after the 1950s may have taken place as the result of the reduction in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the increase in N-nitrosamines in inhaled smoke from filtered low-yield cigarettes. The predominant mutation patterns of these tumors also suggest differences in their etiology. We tested the hypothesis that genetic susceptibility to PAHs, as determined by polymorphisms in CYP1A1 and GSTM1, predominantly causes lung SCCs, and susceptibility to nitrosamines, as determined by polymorphisms in CYP2E1, predominantly causes lung ACs. CYP1A1 and GSTM1 play a major role in the metabolic activation and detoxification of PAHs, respectively, and CYP2E1 plays a major role in the metabolic activation of nitrosamines. We conducted a population-based case-control study among 341 incident lung cancer cases and 456 controls of Caucasian, Japanese, or Hawaiian origin. In-person interviews collected detailed information on lifestyle risk factors, and DNA extracted from peripheral leukocytes was used in PCR-based genotyping assays. Logistic regression analyses were used to compute odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each cell type, adjusting for smoking and dietary variables. The presence of at least one copy of the CYP1A1 MspI variant allele was found to be associated with a 2.4-fold (95% CI, 1.2-4.7) increase in the risk of SCC when this gene was considered singly and a 3.1-fold (95% CI, 1.2-7.9) increase in the risk of SCC when combined with a GSTM1 deletion. No significant association was found between MspI and all lung cancers or other cell types or with the CYP1A1 exon 7 polymorphism.

Inverse associations with these two closely linked CYP2E1 polymorphisms were also suggested for small cell carcinoma.

Preliminary evidence suggests that APOE genotype appears to be a risk factor for not only cardiovascular disease, but also Alzheimer's disease and cancer. We screened the APOE genotype in 290 breast cancer patients and 232 non-cancer controls and determined the relationship between APOE gene polymorphism and breast cancer in Taiwan. We found risk for breast cancer was associated with the APOE genotype (xi(2) = 8.652, p = 0.013). Carriers of the epsilon4 allele were more common in breast cancer cases than carriers of epsilon3 allele (p = 0.004, OR = 1.786, 95% CI: 1.197-2.664). In addition, the epsilon4 allele is also associated with HER2/neu negative status in breast cancer patients (p = 0.006, OR = 0.277, 95% CI: 0.111-0.693). No significant associations between APOE genotype and tumor grade, TN classification, progesterone receptor, estrogen receptor, lymphatic invasion, or recurrence of breast cancer were in evidence.

Mouse models suggest that variation in LIPG influences high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism, but only limited data are available in humans. This study examined associations of LIPG haplotypes, comprising a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region (-384A>C), and a nonsynonymous SNP in exon 3 (Thr111Ile or 584C>T), with lipoprotein risk factors in 541 adult Japanese Americans. A marginal association was found between LIPG diplotypes and HDL cholesterol (p=0.045). Stronger associations were seen for HDL3 cholesterol (p=0.005) and Apolipoprotein AI plasma levels (p=0.002). After adjustment for age, gender, smoking and medications, individuals homozygous for the minor allele at both SNPs (*4 haplotype) had a more favorable risk factor profile, compared to other haplotype combinations. No relationship was seen for plasma triglyceride levels or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) size, but the homozygous *4 diplotype was also associated with lower Apolipoprotein B and LDL cholesterol levels (p=0.001 and 0.015, respectively). In conclusion, this community-based family study of Japanese Americans demonstrates that LIPG variants are associated with HDL related risk factors, and may play a role in susceptibility to cardiovascular disease in this population.", "title": "Association of endothelial lipase gene (LIPG) haplotypes with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol subfractions and apolipoprotein AI plasma levels in Japanese Americans.", "pmid": "16023652", "id": "1172"},
{"abstract": "There have been several studies suggesting that sex hormones are involved in characterization of human mental function and behaviour. Recently, it has been reported that the -34T/C polymorphism of cytochrome P450 17 (CYP17) gene affects sex hormone dispositions. Therefore, it is possible that the CYP17 -34T/C polymorphism affects personality traits. In the present study, the association of this genetic polymorphism with personality traits was examined in 595 healthy Japanese. Personality traits were assessed by the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), and the CYP17 -34T/C polymorphism was detected by a PCR-RFLP method. In males, the scores of novelty seeking, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence were higher in the group with the C allele than in that without this allele. In females, none of the seven TCI dimensions was different between the two genotype groups. The present study thus suggests that the -34T/C polymorphism of the CYP17 gene affects personality traits of healthy males, but not females, and this gender-dependent effect may be mediated by the action of sex hormones such as estradiol and testosterone.", "title": "Association study of the cytochrome P450 17 gene polymorphism with personality traits in healthy subjects.", "pmid": "18619494", "id": "1173"},

The genes interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6), muscle segment homeobox 1 (MSX1) and paired box gene 9 (PAX9) are important for the development of the maxillofacial region and dentition. The aim of this study was to explore how genetic variations in IRF6, MSX1 and PAX9, as well as gene\u2011gene interactions, are associated with NSCL/P. We investigated 9 IRF6 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 2 MSX1 tag SNPs and 8 PAX9 tag SNPs selected from HapMap data from the Chinese population. The SNPs were examined for associations with NSCL/P in 204 patients and 226 controls. The results demonstrated a significant association between NSCL/P and rs2073485, rs2235371, rs2236909 and rs861020 in the IRF6 gene, and haplotype analysis supported these findings. A marginally significant difference was observed in the NSCL/P group for rs17176643 in the PAX9 gene compared to the control group. The results of gene\u2011gene interaction analyses also indicated that the combination of rs2073485, rs2235371 or rs2236909 in IRF6 and rs17176643 in PAX9, increased the risk of NSCL/P.

The two-fold objective of our study was to determine the presence of PPARalpha polymorphisms and their frequencies in Japanese populations and then to evaluate the effects of any alleles on metabolic parameters and alcohol drinking. Analysis of coding SNP in PPARalpha was performed in 706 Japanese men; from these subjects 655 men were further studied after exclusion criteria were applied. PPARalpha-V227A, which has not been reported in Europe and North America as a major polymorphism, was discovered with the frequency of 0.05. PPARalpha-L162V was found in European and North American populations, but not in Japanese, thus confirming the ethnic differences in PPARalpha allele frequencies. The A227 allele was associated with increased serum concentrations of gamma glutamyltranspeptidase. In non-drinkers, the total cholesterol (TC) levels were significantly lower in those having the PPARalpha-V227A polymorphism. In drinkers, however, it was comparable among V227A polymorphisms, and conversely higher in those having both A227 and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) variants when further divided according to the ALDH2 polymorphism. Significant interactions between PPARalpha-V227A polymorphism and drinking were also found for TC, triglyceride levels and AST/ALT ratios. These results suggest that the activity of the A227 allele without drinking may be higher than in wild-type allele, but its activity may become lower during drinking habits.

{"abstract": "The association of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) with carotid atherosclerosis remains inconsistent. This may be due to small sample size and inappropriate analysis. We investigated the association of C677T/MTHFR with blood pressure and carotid atherosclerosis in a Japanese general population. Subjects (30 to 89 years of age; 1693 women, 1554 men) who gave informed consent were randomly selected from a general population in Suita, Japan. MTHFR genotypes were determined by TaqMan polymerase chain reaction. Carotid atherosclerosis was evaluated by high-resolution ultrasonography with atherosclerotic indexes of intimal-medial thickness (IMT), maximum IMT in the common carotid artery (CCA), plaque score, and stenosis (>50%). Age-adjusted diastolic blood pressure was significantly higher in women with the TT genotype than in those with the CC genotype. In a recessive model (CC+CT versus TT), all adjusted odds ratios for hypertension and >50% stenosis in women were 1.42 and 3.42 (95% confidence intervals, 1.01 to 1.99 and 1.23 to 9.53), respectively. In women, maximum IMT in CCA for smokers with the TT genotype was significantly higher than for smokers with the CC genotype and nonsmokers with the TT genotype (P<0.05). Our study suggests that the MTHFR TT genotype is a risk factor for hypertension and carotid stenosis in women. Significant interactions between C677T/MTHFR and smoking on maximum IMT in CCA were observed in women but not in men.

{"abstract": "The androgen receptor (AR) gene encodes a type of nuclear receptor that functions as a steroid-hormone activated transcription factor. In its coding region, AR includes a CAG repeat, which has been intensely studied due to the inverse correlation between repeat size and AR transcriptional activity. Several studies have reported different (CAG)n sizes associated with the risk of androgen-linked diseases. We aimed at clarifying the mechanisms on the origin of newly CAG sized alleles through a strategy involving the analysis of the associated haplotype diversity. We genotyped 374 control individuals of European and Asian ancestry, and reconstructed the haplotypes associated with the CAG repeat, defined by 10 SNPs and 6 flanking STRs. The most powerful SNPs to tag AR lineages are rs7061037-rs12012620 and rs34191540-rs6625187-rs2768578 in Europeans and Asians, respectively. In the most frequent AR lineage, (CAG)18 alleles seem to have been generated by a multistep mutation mechanism, most probably from longer alleles. We further noticed that the DXS1194-DXS1111 haplotype, in linkage disequilibrium with AR-(CAG)n expanded alleles responsible for spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), is rare among our controls; however, the haplotype strategy here described may be used to clarify the origin of expansions in other populations, as in future association studies.", "title": "Diversity in the androgen receptor CAG repeat has been shaped by a multistep mutational mechanism.", "pmid": "25078541", "id": "1192"},

Polymorphic sites are recognized by restriction endonuclease treatment and separation of the DNA fragments by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The resulting fragments of different lengths are used to identify different alleles. We used the above technique for typing the HLA-DQA1 alleles in 41 Tunisian diabetic patients. The frequency of DQA1*0301 was greatly increased compared with the control group. This was in agreement with previously published data in Caucasian and Japanese insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients, while the significant increase in the frequency of the DQA1*0501 allele was comparable with that of Caucasian IDDM patients but contrasted with a decrease in this allele in Japanese IDDM patients.

RET is a well-established susceptibility locus, although existing evidence strongly suggests additional loci contributing to sporadic HSCR. To identify these additional genetic loci, we carried out a genome-wide association study using the Affymetrix 500K marker set. We successfully genotyped 293,836 SNPs in 181 Chinese subjects with sporadic HSCR and 346 ethnically matched control subjects. The SNPs most associated with HSCR were genotyped in an independent set of 190 HSCR and 510 control subjects. Aside from SNPs in RET, the strongest overall associations in plausible candidate genes were found for 2 SNPs located in intron 1 of the neuregulin1 gene (NRG1) on 8p12, with rs16879552 and rs7835688 yielding odds ratios of 1.68 [CI(95%):(1.40, 2.00), P = 1.80 x 10(-8)] and 1.98 [CI(95%):(1.59, 2.47), P = 1.12 x 10(-9)], respectively, for the heterozygous risk genotypes under an additive model.

The information of 141 ESRD patients was obtained from the medical record of the Keelung branch of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and was compared to the HLA type of a control group comprized of 190 healthy unrelated Taiwanese from one of our previous studies. In order to standardize the HLA designation of prior low-resolution typings with the more advanced DNA based typings, all HLA-A, -B and -DR were analyzed using a low resolution serologic equivalent. The current work suggests that HLA-DR3 (odds ratio = 1.91, 95 % CI = 1.098-3.324, P = 0.024, Pc = 0.312) and HLA-DR11 (odds ratio = 2.06, 95 % CI = 1.133-3.761, P = 0.021, Pc = 0.273) may represent susceptibility risk factors for the development of ESRD in Taiwanese individuals. On the other hand, HLA-DR8 (odds ratio = 0.47, 95 % CI = 0.236-0.920, p = 0.027. Pc = 0.351) may be a protective factor. HLA-A and -B antigens did not show any contribution of progression to ESRD. However, we note that the significance of all these findings is lost when the results are corrected for multiple comparisons according to Bonferroni. Further investigation with a larger group of patients and control is needed to resolve this issue.

Polymorphisms of CYP1A1 gene were detected by PCR-RFLP method. The homozygous mutant (G/G) of m2 polymorphism was significantly associated with BC. Consequently, association of both m2 heterozygous mutant genotype (A/G) and combined group [homozygous (G/G) plus heterozygous (A/G) mutant genotype] showed association with postmenopausal women. Incidences of BC were also found to be independent of clinicopathological factors except heterozygous mutant genotype (A/G) m2 showed association with dietary factors and high grade tumors while homozygous mutant (G/G) m2 showed association with ER/PR-positive BC cases.

Single-base extension (SBE) method was employed for genotyping. Genotypic influence of IL18 was analysed using logistic and multiple-regression models. Although no polymorphisms in the IL18 gene showed significant association with the risk of asthma development, analyses of the association with specific serum IgE levels to Dermatophagoides farinae (D.f.) and D. pteronyssinus (D.p.) among asthmatic patients revealed significant associations with two completely linked SNPs, i.e. -148G>C and +13925A>C(Ser35Ser) (P = 0.01-0.11 for D.f. and P = 0.005-0.11 for D.p.).

We assessed the clinical utility of GWAS-derived T2D susceptibility variants in a Japanese population. We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study. T2D cases (n = 2613) and controls (n = 1786) with complete genotype data for 49 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected for analyses.

The GRS-49 was significantly associated with T2D (P = 8.75 \u00d7 10(-45)). The area under the curve (AUC) for GRS-49 alone (model 1) and for age, sex, and body mass index (model 2) was 0.624 and 0.743, respectively.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms at promoter regions ( IL-4-590C/T and MXA-88G/T) were screened using PCR-RFLP method. Genotyping was done for GT repeat polymorphism within intron 7 of IRF-1. The TT genotype of MXA, as well as the CT genotype of IL-4, were seen a little more frequently among the SSPE patients as compared to the control subjects. The values though, did not reach statistical significance. IRF-1 analysis did not differ between the two groups. Our study failed to demonstrate a significant association between IL-4, MXA, or IRF-1, and SSPE in the Filipino population.

{"abstract": "In endemic areas, including Japan, basal core promoter (BCP) and precore (PC) variants of hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been reported to be associated with the clinical outcome of acute hepatitis B patients. However, the associations of BCP/PC variants with clinical outcomes have not been observed in nonendemic areas. HBV subgenotypes, which show geographic variations in prevalence, may underlie this discrepancy in clinical outcomes. Little is known about the differences in the clinical and virological features of HBV subgenotypes and BCP/PC variants. The aim of this study was to investigate the distributions of subgenotypes and BCP/PC variants to identify clinical differences in acute hepatitis B patients. One hundred thirty-nine patients with acute hepatitis were enrolled. Nested polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the pre-S region of HBV for genotyping and the BCP/PC regions for variant screening. HBV subgenotypes A1 (n = 3), A2 (n = 28), B1 (n = 3), B2 (n = 9), C1 (n = 5), C2 (n = 84), C variant (n = 1), D2 (n = 3), and H (n = 3) were detected. BCP/PC variants were not associated with progression to chronic hepatitis. Patients infected with subgenotype C2 who progressed to fulminant hepatic failure frequently carried variants at nucleotides non-T1753 and non-T1754 and T1762, A1764, and A1896. BCP/PC variants would be associated with progression to fulminant hepatitis in subgenotype C2.

Its reported incidence is 1-2 per 1,000 in Caucasians and 0.03-0.37 per 1,000 in Japanese. Doi et al. [Doi et al. (2005); ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec 67:289-293] recently reported that two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in KCNE1 and KCNE3 are associated with MD in Japanese subjects. Consistent with this possibility, these two genes encode potassium channels that are expressed in the stria vascularis and endolymphatic sac, respectively, and their role in ion transport suggests that they may be important in inner ear homeostasis. To establish whether a similar association exists in the Caucasian MD population, we sequenced the coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of both genes in 180 Caucasian persons with MD and 180 matched Caucasian controls. Neither of the two reported SNPs was significantly associated with MD when compared to the Caucasian controls (KCNE1, P = 0.55; KCNE3, P = 0.870). Comparison of allele frequencies between the Japanese MD population and our study population revealed no significant difference between groups (KCNE1, P = 0.90; KCNE3, P = 0.862), suggesting that the significant differences reported in the Japanese study arose from their control population. Six additional SNPs in both KCNE1 and KCNE3 were genotyped and none was associated with MD. Population stratification within our MD and Caucasian control population was excluded.

A point mutation in the encoding region of the methionine synthase gene, which results in substitution of an aspartic acid for a glycine residue (D919G), has been identified in patients of the cblG genetic complementation group; these patients exhibit significantly decreased methionine synthase activity. Nevertheless, the D919G mutation has also been reported to be common in the general population. In this study, we analyzed the distribution of methionine synthase D/G polymorphism in the Japanese population and examined the extent to which it is associated with altered homocysteine metabolism and late-onset vascular diseases. We studied 215 patients with coronary artery disease, 251 patients with histories of ischemic stroke, and 257 control subjects. The methionine synthase genotype was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction followed by HaeIII digestion; allele frequencies for the D919G variant of the enzyme proved to be similar in all 3 subject groups (control subjects, 0.17; coronary artery disease patients, 0. 17; and ischemic stroke patients, 0.19). Furthermore, in patients with ischemic stroke, plasma levels of homocyst(e)ine and folate were similar, irrespective of methionine synthase genotype. Thus, the methionine synthase D919G mutation was found to be common in the Japanese general population, and it appears unlikely that this polymorphism has a major effect on homocysteine metabolism and/or the onset of vascular diseases.", "title": "Polymorphism of the methionine synthase gene : association with homocysteine metabolism and late-onset vascular diseases in the Japanese population.", "pmid": "9974410", "id": "1234"},

It exists as common high and low activity alleles in the population (determined by a valine 158 methionine polymorphisms), and high red blood cell activity of COMT has previously been associated with schizophrenia. To examine the relationship between COMT and schizophrenia genetically, the transmission disequilibrium test was performed on 22 multiply affected Caucasian and Japanese families genotyped for val158met and a second, silent, polymorphism (C256G), using PCR based assays. The high activity val158 allele was transmitted from parents to the affected individuals more frequently than the low activity met158 allele, although this was not statistically significant. Combining this data with a previous study using Chinese family trios with schizophrenia (Li et al., 1996) gave a highly significant result (p = 0.0015). The G256 allele was also transmitted preferentially to the affected offspring, and this was statistically significant when schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and unspecified functional psychosis were included in the definition of the affected phenotype (p = 0.03). Overall, these findings may indicate an effect of COMT alleles on susceptibility to schizophrenia, or reflect linkage disequilibrium with a different causative polymorphism in the vicinity.

Among the genes that are responsible for LQTS, KCNE1 and KCNE2 are members of the KCNE family of genes, and function as ancillary subunits of Kv channels. The third KCNE gene, KCNE3, is expressed in cardiac myocytes and interacts with KCNQ1 to change the channel properties. However, KCNE3 has never been linked to LQTS. To investigate the association between KCNE3 and LQTS, we conducted a genetic screening of KCNE3 mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 485 Japanese LQTS probands using DHPLC-WAVE system and direct sequencing. Consequently, we identified two KCNE3 missense mutations, located in the N- and C-terminal domains. The functional effects of these mutations were examined by heterologous expression systems using CHO cells stably expressing KCNQ1. One mutation, p.R99lambdaH was identified in a 76-year-old woman who suffered torsades de pointes (TdP) after administration of disopyramide. Another mutation, p.T4A was identified in a 16-year-old boy and 67-year-old woman. Although the boy carried another KCNH2 mutation, he was asymptomatic. On the other hand, the woman suffered from hypokalemia-induced TdP. In a series of electrophysiological analyses, the KCNQ1(Q1)+KCNE3(E3)-R99lambdaH channel significantly reduced outward current compared to Q1+E3-WT, though the current density of the Q1+E3-T4A channel displayed no statistical significance.

In polycystic ovary patients, the NS population was significantly larger when compared with the spontaneously ovulating group (66.7 versus 43.5%, P < 0.05). In the SS group, a significantly higher (46%) basal level of serum FSH was observed as compared with that in the NS group (P < 0.05).

{"abstract": "Previous studies investigated the association between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma risk, but the impact of MTHFR C677T polymorphism on hepatocellular carcinoma was still unclear, owing to the obvious inconsistence from those studies. This study aimed to quantify the strength of the association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma risk by performing a meta-analysis. We searched the PubMed and Wanfang databases for studies on the association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma risk. We estimated the pooled odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) to assess the association. Fifteen studies with 8,625 participants were finally included into the meta-analysis. Meta-analyses of total 15 studies suggested that MTHFR C677T polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma under two main genetic models (for TT versus CC, OR\u2009=\u20091.19, 95% CI 1.03-1.37, P\u2009=\u20090.016; for TT versus CT/CC, OR\u2009=\u20091.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.28, P\u2009=\u20090.032). Subgroup meta-analyses suggested that MTHFR C677T polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in Asians, but not in Caucasians. Thus, individuals with homozygote genotype TT of MTHFR C677T have obviously increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.", "title": "Significant association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma risk: a meta-analysis.", "pmid": "24132589", "id": "1251"},
{"abstract": "Since the serotonin (5-HT) is associated with circadian rhythm and breathing regulation, the serotonin transporter (5-HTT), which plays an important role in serotoninergic transmission, might be a strong candidate gene in the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). To investigate the association of 5-HTT gene polymorphisms with OSAS and clinical characteristics. We genotyped the 5-HTT gene linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) and a variable number of tandem repeats at intron 2 (STin2.VNTR) in 254 OSAS patients and 338 healthy controls in Chinese Han population. In total sample, the 10-repeat allele of STin2.VNTR was significantly associated with OSAS (P = 0.007, OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.15-2.58), but no association was found in 5-HTTLPR. In male subjects, both polymorphisms showed significant association with OSAS (Allele L: P = 0.005, OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.87; Allele 10: P = 0.002, OR= 1.94, 95% CI = 1.26 to 3.00). Two haplotypes, S-12 and L-10, constructed by the above polymorphisms also revealed significant associations with OSAS (global P-values were 0.020 for total sample and 0.0006 for male subjects, respectively). Male patients carrying the haplotype S-12 showed a significantly lower apnea / hypopnea index (AHI), depressive factor, plasma 5-HT level and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels, but higher episodic memory, when compared with non-S-12 carriers (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences were found in excessive daytime sleepiness or other psychological function across haplotype carriers (P > 0.05).

However, previous case-control studies on the association between the variants of VDR and prostate cancer have shown contradictory results. Therefore, the role of VDR in prostate cancer remains unresolved. To investigate a potential correlation between VDR polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk, a meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies was conducted. Eligible studies were retrieved via both computerized searches and review of references. The association of VDR polymorphisms to prostate cancer was evaluated for 4 well-known VDR polymorphisms (FokI, BsmI, ApaI and TaqI) separately. Stratified analyses on ethnic characteristics (Caucasians or Asians), cancer stage (localized or advanced) and Gleason score (>7) were performed. Fixed- or random-effect models were used to summarize the estimates of odds ratio (OR) with 95%CI according to the heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. A total of 40 studies met the inclusion criteria of the meta-analysis. The FF genotype illustrated a protective effect on prostate cancer in the Caucasian subgroup (OR=0.905, 95%CI 0.823, 0.995).

{"abstract": "Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) plays an important role in dopamine degradation, which is associated with the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and alcoholism. A functional COMT polymorphism, Val158Met (rs4680 G\u2009>\u2009A), affects the onset of AD and is associated with alcohol dependence through dopamine receptor sensitivity in the prefrontal cortex. The aim of this case-control study (398 cases and 149 controls) was to investigate whether Val158Met polymorphism influences the onset of AD stratified according to alcohol consumption and apolipoprotein E (APOE) status. We also used single photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) to analyse 26 patients with AD with the polymorphism. As a function of APOE status, the genotypic frequencies of rs4680 in patients with AD did not differ from those in controls. We detected a significant association between high alcohol consumption in patients with AD (HAC-AD group) and the polymorphism in genotypic and allelic frequencies. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that the presence of the APOE genotype with rs4680 increased the risk for HAC-AD synergistically. Hyperperfusion in the right sub-lobar insula of patients with the G/G genotype was found compared with that of patients with the G/A genotype. SPECT studies showed a relationship between the polymorphism and compensatory reactions for dysfunctions of dopaminergic neurotransmission in AD pathophysiology.

Although long-term follow-up studies have shown that a relapse rate of 30-40% can occur in AIP after remission with corticosteroids, there are few genetic characteristic predictors of relapse in AIP patients. Toll-like receptor (TLR) is an important mediator in both innate and adaptive immunity. Polymorphisms in TLR4 gene have been linked with several autoimmune and allergic diseases. We therefore investigated the genetic association between TLR4 polymorphisms and AIP susceptibility and relapse in a Japanese population. Eight SNPs in TLR4 (rs10759930, rs1927914, rs1927911, rs12377632, rs2149356, rs11536889, rs7037117, and rs7045953) were genotyped in 59 patients with AIP and 126 healthy controls using a TaqMan assay.

{"abstract": "Polydipsia is a serious condition often seen among patients with schizophrenia (SCZ). The cause of polydipsia is unknown; hence, it is hard to treat or manage. Animal studies showed that the drinking behavior is regulated by central dopaminergic neurotransmission at the hypothalamus. Meanwhile, the existence of a genetic predisposition to polydipsia in patients with SCZ has been suggested. The purpose of this study was to assess whether a functional polymorphism, Val(108/158)Met in the gene for catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), is associated with susceptibility to polydipsia using a Japanese sample of SCZ. Our sample includes 330 chronic patients with SCZ (83 polydipsic patients and 247 non-polydipsic controls). The common COMT Val(108/158)Met polymorphism was genotyped, and the differences in genotype distribution and allele frequency between cases and controls were evaluated using the \u03c7(2) test. A significant association between the COMT Val(108/158)Met polymorphism and polydipsia was found (genotype distribution: \u03c7(2) = 13.0, df = 2, p = 0.001; allele frequency: \u03c7(2) = 7.50, df = 1, p = 0.006). The high-COMT activity group (Val/Val) was more frequent among patients with polydipsia compared with the low-COMT activity group (Val/Met + Met/Met) [odds ratio (OR) = 2.46]. The association survived after controlling for other possible confounding factors, including gender, age, age of onset, current antipsychotic dose, and smoking status. Our results suggest that the COMT Val(108/158)Met genotype may confer susceptibility to polydipsia in SCZ. To our knowledge, this is the first association study between the COMT gene and polydipsia in SCZ.

Meta-analyses of all the eligible studies were performed, which focused on four most commonly investigated VDR polymorphisms, ApaI, BsmI, TaqI and FokI. A total of 1820 GD patients and 2066 controls from Caucasian and Asian populations were included in the meta-analyses. The odds ratio (OR) was used as the measure of effect size. We performed analyses by estimating the race-specific ORs. Sensitivity analyses were performed by excluding studies with controls inconsistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The pooled ORs for ApaI, BsmI and FokI in Asian populations were 1.31 (95% CI: 1.04-1.66, P = 0.02), 1.58 (95% CI: 1.13-2.22, P = 0.007) and 1.68 (95% CI: 1.28-2.20, P = 0.0002), respectively. None of the four polymorphisms had a statistically significant association between VDR variants and susceptibility to GD in Caucasian populations. Sensitivity analyses generated similar results to those of the primary analyses.

Current research examined the association between inhibitor development and F9 genotypes and polymorphisms in immune response genes in Chinese HB patients. 11 inhibitor-positive HB patients and 41 inhibitor-negative HB patients were enrolled. Direct sequencing, copy number variation (CNV) detection and fragment length analysis were applied to identify F9 genotypes and 15 polymorphisms in immune response genes. 7 patients developed high titer inhibitors, with 5 of them having histories of consecutive exposure to FIX products on demand for at least 5\u00a0days. Allergic reactions/anaphylaxis to prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) occurred in 3 patients before inhibitors were detected. Five nonsense mutations (E54X, R75X, Q185X, R298X and R379X), two large deletions (E1~6del and E1~8del) and one missense mutation (S411G) were identified in patients with inhibitors.

This risk may be modified by variation in genetic polymorphisms and coal subtypes. Our objective was to use molecular epidemiological techniques to investigate the relationship among genetic polymorphisms, coal subtype and lung cancer risk in Xuanwei County. On the basis of two population-based case-control studies in residents of Xuanwei County, China, questionnaires covering demographic information, smoking history, family and personal medical history, and information on other variables were administered and buccal cells and sputum samples were collected separately from each subject enrolled to extract DNA. GST superfamily, AKR1C3 superfamily, OGG1 superfamily and other genotype were scanned by useing PCR method. ORs and 95%CIs were used to estimate the association between genotypes, coal subtypes and lung cancer risk factors by conditional Logistic regression using Statistical Analysis Software. Compared with subjects who using smokeless coal or wood, smoky coal use was statistically significantly associated with lung cancer risk (OR=7.7, 95%CI: 4.5-13.3). There was marked heterogeneity in risk estimates for specific subtypes of smoky coal. Estimates were highest for coal from the Laibin (OR=24.8), Longtan (OR=11.6) and Baoshan (OR=6.0) coal types, and lower for coal from other types; the risk within the same subtype of coal in male and female were similar. The GSTM1-null genotype, the AKR1C3 (Ex1-70C>G), OGG1 (Ex6-315C>G) genotypes were closely associated with increased risk of lung cancer in Xuanwei County, and their odds ratios (95%CI) were 2.3 (1.3-4.2), 1.8 (1.0-3.5) and 1.9 (1.1-3.3), respectively. Compared to subjects who with GSTM1-positive and used less than 130 tons of smoky coal during their lifetime, higher risks were closely associated with GSTM1-null and heavier users (\u2265130 tons), with the OR was 4.9 (95%CI: 1.3-18.2) and 2.7 (95%CI: 1.0-7.4) for female and male, respectively. However, higher risks were only found within female for AKR1C3 (Ex1-70C>G) and OGG1 (Ex6-315C>G), with OR (95%CI)=12.9 (2.2-107.8) and 5.7 (1.1-34.2), respectively. Lung cancer risks varied among coal subtypes; however, risks were similar between men and women exposed to the same type of coal. The GSTM1-null genotype may enhance susceptibility to air pollution from indoor smoky coal combustion emissions. AKR1C3 and OGG1 genotypes were significantly associated with higher risk of lung cancer, especially among heavily exposed women.", "title": "[Molecular epidemiology study in Xuanwei: the relationship among \u2029coal type, genotype and lung cancer risk].", "pmid": "25603868", "id": "1265"},
{"abstract": "Early detection and diagnosis remains an effective yet challenging approach to improve the clinical outcome of patients with cancer. Low-dose computed tomography screening has been suggested to improve the diagnosis of lung cancer in high-risk individuals. To make screening more efficient, it is necessary to identify individuals who are at high risk. We conducted a case-control study to develop a predictive model for identification of such high-risk individuals. Clinical data from 705 lung cancer patients and 988 population-based controls were used for the development and evaluation of the model. Associations between environmental variants and lung cancer risk were analyzed with a logistic regression model. The predictive accuracy of the model was determined by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the optimal operating point. Our results indicate that lung cancer risk factors included older age, male gender, lower education level, family history of cancer, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower body mass index, smoking cigarettes, a diet with less seafood, vegetables, fruits, dairy products, soybean products and nuts, a diet rich in meat, and exposure to pesticides and cooking emissions. The area under the curve was 0.8851 and the optimal operating point was obtained. With a cutoff of 0.35, the false positive rate, true positive rate, and Youden index were 0.21, 0.87, and 0.66, respectively.

In this study, we assessed the hypothesis that genetic variations of the IGF-1 receptor may be linked to the diversity of left ventricular (LV) structure in hypertensive patients. Genotypes in 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the IGF-1 receptor gene identified by direct sequencing were determined in 795 Japanese patients with essential hypertension. In echocardiographic examinations, LV mass index (LVMI) and relative wall thickness (RWT) were measured. Among 12 SNPs, promoter -328C>T and intron-13 275124A>C polymorphisms were significantly associated with LV hypertrophy (LVMI> or =125 g m(-2)) and concentric change (RWT> or =0.44), respectively. In allele frequencies, the C allele of -328C>T was related to LV hypertrophy, and the A allele of 275124A>C was related to LV concentric change. In fact, LVMI and prevalence of LV hypertrophy increased in CC genotype of -328C>T. RWT and prevalence of LV concentric change increased in AA genotype of 275124A>C. A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the presence of CC genotype of -328C>T or AA genotype of 275124A>C was an independent determinant for LV hypertrophy or concentric change, respectively. Furthermore, the combination of CC of -328C>T and AA of 275124A>C genotypes was significantly associated with abnormal LV geometry, especially concentric hypertrophy. Our findings show that two SNPs of the IGF-1 receptor gene are related to LV hypertrophy in patients with essential hypertension, suggesting that the genetic variation of the IGF-1 receptor may be involved in the diversity of LV structure in hypertensives.", "title": "Association of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor gene polymorphisms with left ventricular mass and geometry in essential hypertension.", "pmid": "19759555", "id": "1267"},

However, the associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes of these enzymes have not been well studied. We genotyped 16 SNPs from 7 genes encoding TCA cycle metabolic enzymes in 697 colorectal carcinoma (CRC) patients receiving surgical resection and analyzed their associations with clinical outcomes by multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. Then, the significant results were validated in another cohort of 256 CRC patients. We identified 4 SNPs in 2 genes had significant associations with CRC death risk and 5 SNPs in 3 genes had significant associations with CRC recurrence risk. Similar significant results were confirmed for rs4131826 in SDHC gene, rs544184 in SDHD gene and rs12071124 in FH gene in a validation cohort. Further analysis indicated that unfavorable genotypes exhibited a significant cumulative effect on overall and recurrence-free survival in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, survival tree analysis indicated that SNP rs4131826 in SDHC gene and SNP rs12071124 in FH gene were the primary factors contributing to the different overall survival time and recurrence-free survival time of CRC patients, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis further validated the effect of rs4131826 and rs544184 on expression of SDHC and SDHD in tissue samples.

{"abstract": "In Taiwan, Alzheimer's disease (AD) followed by vascular dementia (VsD) is the most common cause of dementia among Taiwanese (ethnic Chinese). Several studies have documented the increase of risk for AD among the apolipoprotein E gene allele 4 (ApoE4) carriers in Taiwanese. It is a consensus that ApoE4 is the most important risk factor for AD at present. The researchers also found that ApoE4 allele frequency is lower in Taiwanese, around 7%, than it in the most Caucasian populations. This phenomenon raises the hypothesis that low ApoE4 allele frequency contributes to low prevalence of AD in Taiwanese. Besides, many genetic studies were involved in genetic impacts on modulation or regulation of the manifestation, progression, and treatment response of AD. But, these genetic studies are still inconclusive. Few familial AD attributed to PS1 gene mutation has been identified. The genetic studies of VsD are just beginning and NOTCH3 gene mutation has been detected in Taiwanese cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarct and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) families. Since there is a large proportion of non- ApoE4-associated AD in Taiwanese, it remains more researches to look for novel genetic factors in Taiwanese.

{"abstract": "Large-scale genome-wide association studies have identified multiple genetic variants that are associated with elevated body mass index (BMI) or the risk of obesity in Caucasian or Asian populations. We examined whether these variants are individually associated with obesity in Chinese children, and also assessed their cumulative effects and predictive value for obesity risk in Chinese children. We genotyped 40 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and conducted association analyses for 32/40 SNPs with an estimated minor allele frequency >1% in 2 030 unrelated Chinese children, including 607 normal-weight, 718 overweight, and 705 obese individuals from two cross-sectional study groups. Logistic regression and linear regression under the additive model were used to examine associations, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC) was reported as prediction summary. We identified obesity association for 6 SNPs near SEC16B, RBJ, CDKAL1, TFAP2B, MAP2K5 and FTO (odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 1.19 to 1.41, nominal two-sided P-values < 0.05).

Interleukin (IL) 12 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, which favors the differentiation of T helper 1 (Th1) cells, and forms a link between innate resistance and adaptive immunity. This study aimed to investigate the association between OLP susceptibility and clinical type in Chinese Han population with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL-12A gene. Five SNPs of the IL-12A gene at positions rs2243115, rs2243123, rs583911, rs568408, and rs2243143 were performed in 292 patients with OLP and 686 healthy controls from East China. The five SNPs were genotyped by TaqMan PCR method. The genotype and allelic frequencies were calculated and analyzed. There was a significant difference in rs568408 genotype distributions between patients and controls (P = 0.043). Additionally, there were highly significant increases in rs568408 genotype distributions and allele A frequencies in the erosive OLP group as compared to the control group (P = 0.011, OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.133 -2.732).

Among several hOGG1 gene polymorphisms, the Ser-->Cys polymorphism at position 326 is related to biological function. To investigate the association between Ser326Cys hOGG1 polymorphism and gastric cancer in relation to the potential risk factors of gastric cancer and antioxidant dietary or nutrient intakes, we conducted a case-control study with 142 histologically-confirmed gastric cancer cases and 271 age, sex-matched healthy controls in Japanese populations. Overall, neither the hOGG1 Ser/Cys nor the Cys/Cys genotype was associated with risk of gastric cancer, compared with the Ser/Ser genotype. A significant interaction was observed between hOGG1 Ser/Cys or Cys/Cys genotype and atrophic gastritis (P for interaction=0.03). No significant interaction was found between hOGG1 genotype and antioxidant dietary or nutrient intakes.

{"abstract": "Three common disease susceptibility variants in the NOD2 gene are associated with inflammatory bowel disease in Caucasians, but not in Asians. Aim To screen for NOD2 variants and examine susceptibility for inflammatory bowel disease in North Indians. A case-control study was carried out in Punjab, India. Confirmed cases of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and healthy controls matched for age (+/-10 years) and ethnicity were studied. Besides genotyping the three disease susceptibility variants (SNP8, SNP12 and SNP13), all 12 exons were resequenced to determine other potential single nucleotide polymorphisms. Two hundred and ninety-eight ulcerative colitis, 25 Crohn's disease and 262 controls were investigated. Median age (range) at diagnosis was 39 (7-78) years for ulcerative colitis and 40 (32-58) years for Crohn's disease. All three disease susceptibility variants were either monomorphic or rare in the population. Sequencing (n = 30) revealed two single nucleotide polymorphisms: SNP5 (268 Pro/Ser) and rs2067085 (178 Ser/Ser). The frequency of SNP5 was higher among ulcerative colitis (17% vs. 12% in controls, P = 0.016) and Crohn's disease cases (20% vs. 12%, P = 0.28). SNP5 carriers had elevated risks for ulcerative colitis (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.17-2.52, P = 0.005).

{"abstract": "In the last decade the serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) was likely the most studied genetic variant as predictor of antidepressant response. Nevertheless results are not consistent across studies and previous meta-analysis, since various factors seem to modulate its effect on antidepressant response. With the aim of clarifying this issue, we systematically reviewed literature, selecting 33 studies for an exploratory analysis without any a priori hypothesis. Then we analyzed separately 19 studies performed on Caucasians and 11 on Asians. We tested two phenotypes--remission and response rates--and three genotype comparisons--ll versus ls/ss, ss versus ll/ls and ll versus ss - using the Cochrane review manager. Evaluations were performed separately for SSRIs and mixed/other drugs. Possible clinical modulators were investigated. In the exploratory analysis, we found an association between l allele and l/l genotype and remission. When the analysis was split for ethnic group, in Caucasians we found an association between l allele and both response (OR = 1.58, C.I. 1.16-2.16, p = 0.004), and remission (OR = 1.53, C.I. 1.14-2.04, p = 0.004) in the SSRI group. Only a marginal association between l allele and remission (OR = 1.41, C.I. 1.02-1.95, p = 0.04) survived pooling together mixed antidepressant treatments. In Asians, a small effect of 5-HTTLPR on remission for mixed antidepressants was detected (OR = 2.10, C.I. 1.15-3.84, p = 0.02). Gender, age and age at onset modulated the association in Caucasians. Gender, age and depression severity at baseline modulated the association in Asians. In conclusion, in Caucasians 5-HTTLPR may be a predictor of antidepressant response and remission, while in Asians it does not appear to play a major role.", "title": "Meta-analysis of serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) association with antidepressant efficacy.", "pmid": "22137564", "id": "1283"},

Several factors, including mutations in the NS5A gene, are important predictors of the efficacy of interferon therapy. In this study, we examined the mutational diversity of NS5A and its impact on the efficacy of triple therapy. We enrolled patients with genotype 1b chronic HCV infection and a high viral load (31 males/17 females; mean age, 57.6 years), who were treated with triple therapy. This study was conducted at Kobe University Hospital and at three affiliated hospitals in Hyogo prefecture, Japan, between November 2011 and June 2013.

{"abstract": "Identification of causative genes in mendelian forms of Parkinson's disease is valuable for understanding the cause of the disease. We did genetic studies in a Japanese family with autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease to identify novel causative genes. We did a genome-wide linkage analysis on eight affected and five unaffected individuals from a family with autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (family A). Subsequently, we did exome sequencing on three patients and whole-genome sequencing on one patient in family A. Variants were validated by Sanger sequencing in samples from patients with autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease, patients with sporadic Parkinson's disease, and controls. Participants were identified from the DNA bank of the Comprehensive Genetic Study on Parkinson's Disease and Related Disorders (Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan) and were classified according to clinical information obtained by neurologists. Splicing abnormalities of CHCHD2 mutants were analysed in SH-SY5Y cells. We used the Fisher's exact test to calculate the significance of allele frequencies between patients with sporadic Parkinson's disease and unaffected controls, and we calculated odds ratios and 95% CIs of minor alleles. We identified a missense mutation (CHCHD2, 182C>T, Thr61Ile) in family A by next-generation sequencing. We obtained samples from a further 340 index patients with autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease, 517 patients with sporadic Parkinson's disease, and 559 controls. Three CHCHD2 mutations in four of 341 index cases from independent families with autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease were detected by CHCHD2 mutation screening: 182C>T (Thr61Ile), 434G>A (Arg145Gln), and 300+5G>A. Two single nucleotide variants (-9T>G and 5C>T) in CHCHD2 were confirmed to have different frequencies between sporadic Parkinson's disease and controls, with odds ratios of 2\u00b751 (95% CI 1\u00b748-4\u00b724; p=0\u00b70004) and 4\u00b769 (1\u00b759-13\u00b783, p=0\u00b70025), respectively. One single nucleotide polymorphism (rs816411) was found in CHCHD2 from a previously reported genome-wide association study; however, there was no significant difference in its frequency between patients with Parkinson's disease and controls in a previously reported genome-wide association study (odds ratio 1\u00b717, 95% CI 0\u00b796-1\u00b719; p=0\u00b722).

{"abstract": "Some genetic factors are known to be associated with the formation of cerebral aneurysms in the Caucasian population. One of these factors is endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene polymorphisms. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase genes encode eNOS, which synthesizes NO from l-arginine. There continues to be controversy about the relationships between eNOS gene polymorphisms and the formation of intracranial aneurysms. In this study, the authors evaluated these relationships in the Korean population. Three eNOS polymorphisms (eNOS 27VNTR, T786C, and G894T) were genotyped in 96 patients with ruptured aneurysms, 53 patients with unruptured aneurysms, and in 121 volunteers via polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The mean ages of the patients and healthy volunteers were 52.9 \u00b1 12.3 years and 55.2 \u00b1 9.1 years, respectively. The patient group was composed of 56 men and 93 women, and the healthy volunteer group was composed of 46 men and 75 women. Only the incidence of smoking history was significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group (p = 0.001). The genotypic frequencies for the 3 eNOS gene polymorphisms were in agreement with those predicted by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There were no significant associations between the eNOS recessive models and the formation of an aneurysm. The authors found no genotypic differences between similar races among patients with aneurysms. The present study shows that eNOS 27VNTR, T786C, and G894T polymorphisms cannot be used as indicators of the formation of intracranial aneurysms in Korean patients. To confirm these findings an additional analyses might need to be performed using a larger sample size. There were no differences in the genotypic distributions and allelic frequencies between similar races among patients with aneurysms, which were the same in previously reported normal populations.", "title": "The relationships between endothelial nitric oxide synthase polymorphisms and the formation of intracranial aneurysms in the Korean population.", "pmid": "21631225", "id": "1292"},

The aim of this study was to determine whether variants of this gene are also risk factors for type 2 diabetes development in a UK-resident South Asian cohort of Punjabi ancestry. We genotyped four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TCF7L2 (rs7901695, rs7903146, rs11196205 and rs12255372) in 831 subjects with diabetes and 437 control subjects. The minor allele of each variant was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes; the greatest risk of developing the disease was conferred by rs7903146, with an allelic odds ratio (OR) of 1.31 (95% CI: 1.11 - 1.56, p = 1.96 x 10(-3)). For each variant, disease risk associated with homozygosity for the minor allele was greater than that for heterozygotes, with the exception of rs12255372. To determine the effect on the observed associations of including young control subjects in our data set, we reanalysed the data using subsets of the control group defined by different minimum age thresholds. Increasing the minimum age of our control subjects resulted in a corresponding increase in OR for all variants of the gene (p < or= 1.04 x 10(-7)).

Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) has important roles in the immune and inflammatory responses. The v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (RELA) gene encodes the major component of the NF-\u03baB complex. We genotyped four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the RELA gene and performed a gene-based association analysis using 1224 patients with schizophrenia and 1663 controls. We found significant associations of three SNPs (rs11820062: p=0.00011, rs2306365: p=0.0031, and rs7119750: p=0.0080) with schizophrenia and stronger evidence for association in a multi-marker sliding window haplotype analysis (the lowest p=0.00006). The association between this gene and schizophrenia was evident in male subjects but not in female subjects, when separately analyzed by gender. In silico genotype-gene expression analysis using web database and the WGAViewer software revealed that these three schizophrenia-associated SNPs might be related to RELA mRNA expression in immortalized B-lymphocytes. In silico analysis also suggested the putative promoter SNP, rs11820062, might disrupt the consensus transcription factor binding sequence of the androgen receptor. The impact of four RELA polymorphisms on pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) was investigated in 53 patients with schizophrenia.

{"abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine whether two polymorphisms in the gene encoding IL13 previously associated with Schistosoma hematobium (S. hematobium) and S. mansoni infection are associated with S. japonicum infection. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1800925 (IL13/-1112C>T) and rs20541 (IL13R130Q) were genotyped in 947 unrelated individuals (307 chronically infected, 339 late-stage with liver fibrosis, 301 uninfected controls) from a schistosomiasis-endemic area of Hubei province in China. Regression models were used to evaluate allelic and haplotypic associations with chronic and late-stage schistosomiasis adjusted for non-genetic covariates. Expression of IL-13 was measured in S. japonicun-infected liver fibrosis tissue and normal liver tissue from uninfected controls by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The role of rs1800925 in IL-13 transcription was further determined by Luciferase report assay using the recombinant PGL4.17-rs180092 plasmid. We found SNP rs1800925T was associated with late-stage schistosomiasis caused by S. japonicum but not chronic schistosomiasis (OR = 1.39, 95%CI = 1.02-1.91, p = 0.03) and uninfected controls (OR = 1.49, 95%CI = 1.03-2.13, p = 0.03). Moreover, the haplotype rs1800925T-rs20541C increased the risk of disease progression to late-stage schistosomiasis (OR = 1.46, p = 0.035), whereas haplotype rs1800925C-rs20541A showed a protective role against development of late-stage schistosomiasis (F = 0.188, OR = 0.61, p = 0.002). Furthermore, S. japonicum-induced fibrotic liver tissue had higher IL13 expression than normal liver tissue. Plasmid PGL4.17-rs1800925T showed a stronger relative luciferase activity than Plasmid PGL4.17-rs1800925C in 293FT, QSG-7701 and HL-7702 cell lines. In conclusion, the functional IL13 polymorphism, rs1800925T, previously associated with risk of schistosomiasis, also contributes to risk of late-stage schistosomiasis caused by S. japonicum.

{"abstract": "NK/T cell lymphoma is an aggressive lymphoma almost always associated with EBV. BamHI-A rightward open reading frame 1 (BARF1) and BamHI-H rightward open reading frame 1 (BHRF1) are two EBV early genes, which may be involved in the oncogenicity of EBV. It has been found that V29A strains, a BARF1 mutant subtype, showed higher prevalence in NPC, which may suggest the association between this variation and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). To characterize the sequence variation patterns of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) early genes and to elucidate their association with NK/T cell lymphoma, we analyzed the sequences of BARF1 and BHRF1 in EBV-positive NK/T cell lymphoma samples from Northern China. In situ hybridization (ISH) performed for EBV-encoded small RNA1 (EBER1) with specific digoxigenin-labeled probes was used to select the EBV positive lymphoma samples. Nested-polymerase chain reaction (nested-PCR) and DNA sequence analysis technique were used to obtain the sequences of BARF1 and BHRF1. The polymorphisms of these two genes were classified according to the signature changes and compared with the known corresponding EBV gene variation data. Two major subtypes of BARF1 gene, designated as B95-8 and V29A subtype, were identified. B95-8 subtype was the dominant subtype. The V29A subtype had one consistent amino acid change at amino acid residue 29 (V\u2009\u2192\u2009A). Compared with B95-8, AA change at 88 (L\u2009\u2192\u2009V) of BHRF1 was found in the majority of the isolates, and AA79 (V\u2009\u2192\u2009L) mutation in a few isolates. Functional domains of BARF1 and BHRF1 were highly conserved. The distributions of BARF1 and BHRF1 subtypes had no significant differences among different EBV-associated malignancies and healthy donors. The sequences of BARF1 and BHRF1 are highly conserved which may contribute to maintain the biological function of these two genes.

Previous studies have shown an association between AIEPSs in schizophrenia and RGS2, especially the minor G allele of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4606 (+2971C>G) in RGS2, and have suggested a possible protective effect by the G allele on AIEPSs. In this study, we investigated whether the rs4606 SNP in RGS2 alone also showed an effect on AIEPSs by utilizing the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptom Scale (DIEPSS) in 103 Japanese patients with schizophrenia. In the assumed G allele recessive model, sialorrhea and total Parkinsonism scores were significantly higher in subjects with the GG genotype than in subjects with other genotypes. Other clinical variables were not significantly different among the various genotype groups.

While rare variants (RVs) in the coding sequence (CDS) of several genes involved in ENS development lead to disease, the association of common variants (CVs) with HSCR has only been reported for RET (the major HSCR gene) and NRG1. Importantly, RVs in the CDS of these two genes are also associated with the disorder. To assess independent and joint effects between the different types of RET and NRG1 variants identified in HSCR patients, we used 254 Chinese sporadic HSCR patients and 143 ethnically matched controls for whom the RET and/or NRG1 variants genotypes (rare and common) were available. Four genetic risk factors were defined and interaction effects were modeled using conditional logistic regression analyses and pair-wise Kendall correlations. Our analysis revealed a joint effect of RET CVs with RET RVs, NRG1 CVs or NRG1 RVs. To assess whether the genetic interaction translated into functional interaction, mouse neural crest cells (NCCs; enteric neuron precursors) isolated from embryonic guts were treated with NRG1 (ErbB2 ligand) or/and GDNF (Ret ligand) and monitored during the subsequent neural differentiation process. Nrg1 inhibited the Gdnf-induced neuronal differentiation and Gdnf negatively regulated Nrg1-signaling by down-regulating the expression of its receptor, ErbB2.

{"abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV), because of its error-prone viral polymerase, has a high mutation rate leading to widespread substitutions, deletions, and insertions in the HBV genome. Deletions may significantly change viral biological features complicating the progression of liver diseases. However, the clinical conditions correlating to the accumulation of deleted mutants remain unclear. In this study, we explored HBV deletion patterns and their association with disease status and antiviral treatment by performing whole genome sequencing on samples from 51 hepatitis B patients and by monitoring changes in deletion variants during treatment. Clone sequencing was used to analyze preS regions in another cohort of 52 patients. Among the core, preS, and basic core promoter (BCP) deletion hotspots, we identified preS to have the highest frequency and the most complex deletion pattern using whole genome sequencing. Further clone sequencing analysis on preS identified 70 deletions which were classified into 4 types, the most common being preS2. Also, in contrast to the core and BCP regions, most preS deletions were in-frame. Most deletions interrupted viral surface epitopes, and are possibly involved in evading immuno-surveillance. Among various clinical factors examined, logistic regression showed that antiviral medication affected the accumulation of deletion mutants (OR\u2009=\u20096.81, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.296\u2009~\u200935.817, P\u2009=\u20090.023). In chronic carriers of the virus, and individuals with chronic hepatitis, the deletion rate was significantly higher in the antiviral treatment group (Fisher exact test, P\u2009=\u20090.007). Particularly, preS2 deletions were associated with the usage of nucleos(t)ide analog therapy (Fisher exact test, P\u2009=\u20090.023). Dynamic increases in preS1 or preS2 deletions were also observed in quasispecies from samples taken from patients before and after three months of ADV therapy. In vitro experiments demonstrated that preS2 deletions alone were not responsible for antiviral resistance, implying the coordination between wild type and mutant strains during viral survival and disease development.

The study population comprised 476 male gout patients and 465 male controls. Multiple PCR was performed using time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to identify genotypes. Two SNPs, rs780093 and rs780094, located in intronic regions of the GCKR gene were found to be significantly associated with the development of gout. Thus, the association between the two GCKR SNPs and gout was replicated in the male Han Chinese population investigated in the present study. Furthermore, GCKR was identified as a novel candidate gene associated with gout.", "title": "Association between gout and polymorphisms in GCKR in male Han Chinese.", "pmid": "22395765", "id": "1332"},
{"abstract": "Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I(2)) is a strong vasodilator that inhibits the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells and is also the most potent endogenous inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Therefore, it has been considered to play an important roles in cardiovascular disease. On the basis of the hypothesis that variations of the prostacyclin synthase gene may also play an important role in human cardiovascular disease, we performed a screening for variations in the human prostacyclin synthase gene. We have detected a repeat polymorphism in the promoter region of the human prostacyclin synthase gene. The number of 9-bp (CCGCCAGCC) repeats in the promoter region, which encodes a tandem repeat of Sp1 transcriptional binding sites, varied between 3 and 7 in Japanese subjects. Luciferase reporter analysis indicated that the alleles of 3 and 4 repeats (R3 and R4, respectively) had less promoter activity in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. We then investigated the possible association of this repeat polymorphism with blood pressure in a large population-based sample (the Suita Study), which consisted of 4971 Japanese participants. Multivariate models indicated that participants with the R3R3, R3R4, or R4R4 genotype (SS genotype, n=80) had significantly higher systolic pressure (P=0.0133) and pulse pressure (P=0.0005). The odds ratio of hypertension (140/90 mm Hg) for the SS genotype was 1.942 (95% confidence interval 3.20 to 1.19, P=0.0084). Repeat polymorphism of the human prostacyclin synthase gene seems to be a risk factor for higher pulse pressure and is consequently a risk factor for systolic hypertension in the Japanese population.", "title": "Human prostacyclin synthase gene and hypertension : the Suita Study.", "pmid": "10577996", "id": "1333"},

The genetic risk factors involved in the susceptibility to AIA have recently been investigated, but multilocus single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with this susceptibility has not been evaluated. We examined 246 asthmatic patients: 94 having aspirin intolerance and 152 having aspirin tolerance. We selected 23 SNPs of 13 candidate genes and genotyped each SNP using a primer extension method. Multilocus genetic interactions were examined using multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) to test all multilocus SNP combinations to identify a useful SNP set for predicting the AIA phenotype. We identified the best model using the MDR method, which consisted of a four-locus gene-gene interaction with 65.16% balanced accuracy and a cross-validation consistency of 70% in predicting AIA disease risk among asthmatic patients. This model included four SNPs such as B2ADR 46A>G, CCR3-520T>G, CysLTR1-634C>T, and FCER1B-109T>C.

We conducted a stratified analysis using cancer type, ethnicity and source of controls. We calculated the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

A significant association between TERT rs2853676 allele A and cancer susceptibility was demonstrated under a per-allele risk analysis (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.04-1.13). Stratification analysis revealed an increased cancer risk in subgroups of glioma, lung cancer and ovarian cancer. No significant increase was found in melanoma, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer. In a subgroup analysis of lung cancer, a statistically significant increase was only observed in adenocarcinoma. Moreover, a stratified analysis performed for ethnic groups revealed that the significant increase was only observed in Caucasians, whereas a non-significant increase was found in Asians. This meta-analysis suggests that the TERT genetic polymorphism rs2853676 is associated with increased risk of glioma, lung adenocarcinoma and ovarian cancer among Caucasians.

An age- and gender-matched case-control study involving 210 pairs was conducted. Genotyping of the ABCG2 gene polymorphisms was performed by sequencing. Forty-six placental tissues and umbilical cords from healthy Han Chinese mothers with uncomplicated pregnancy were collected to investigate the impact of these two polymorphisms on the transcription and translation activities of the ABCG2 gene. The results showed that there were no differences in the genotype distributions and allele frequencies of 421C>A polymorphism. For the 34G>A polymorphism, more cases were carriers of the GA/AA genotypes (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-2.3).

In this study, we hypothesized that genetic variants in SMARC genes may modify the capacity of DNA repair to damage. To test this hypothesis, we genotyped a total of 20 polymorphisms in five key SMARC genes (SMARCA5, SMARCC2, SMARCD1, SMARCD2, SMARCD3) to evaluate their associations with DNA damage levels in 307 subjects. The DNA damage levels were measured with comet assay. The multiple linear regression was used to assess the relationship between each polymorphism and DNA damage levels in additive model. We found that the genotypes of rs6857360 (\u03b2=0.23, 95% CI=0.06-0.40, P=0.008) in SMARCA5, rs6919 (\u03b2=0.20, 95% CI=0.05-0.34, P=0.008) and rs2727280 (\u03b2=0.18, 95% CI=0.04-0.33, P=0.013) in SMARCD2, and rs17173769 (\u03b2=-0.27, 95% CI=-0.52 to -0.01, P=0.045) in SMARCD3 were significantly associated with DNA damage levels. After combining these four polymorphisms, we found that the more unfavorable alleles the subjects carried, the heavier DNA damage they suffered, suggesting a locus-dosage effect between combined genotypes and DNA damage levels (P for trend=0.006).

The \u03a6(PT) values among the B(SUB), a measure of their molecular variance, were significantly different from zero with 999 permutations, indicating the validity of B(SUB) classification using the 23 VNTR loci. Higher number of migrants (Nm) values were observed between B1 and T2, B4 and T2, B3 and T2, and B3 and B4 in a phylogenetic network model reconstructed from previously reported single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. These B(SUB) combinations, except B3 and B4, shared SNP types; i.e., ST19 was in B1 and T2 and in B4 and T2, and STK was in B3 and T2. These results taken together suggested that shared SNP types were not due to homoplasy, but to strong genetic relatedness between those B(SUB). Haploid genetic diversity and standardized index of association values were different in each B(SUB), indicating that the diversity of each B(SUB) was different. Although the differences in B(SUB) diversity were mostly in accordance with the relative divergence order of the B(SUB) in a phylogenetic network model, the diversity of B4 was biased by a significant increase in the number of strains in this study from patients born after 1964 (Fisher's exact test P<0.01).

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify serum HBV DNAs from 20 patients with acute hepatitis and 20 patients with chronic hepatitis who had been diagnosed as having so-called hepatitis F on the basis of conventional serological markers. The PCR technique successfully amplified HBV DNAs in 18 (90%) cases of acute hepatitis and 17 (85%) cases of chronic hepatitis. Sequencing of HBV DNAs of six patients (acute 3, chronic 3) revealed equally a T-to-C mutation of DR2 and an 8-nucleotide deletion of the 3'-terminus of the X gene coding region, giving rise to the generation of a C-terminally truncated X protein and probable damage to the enhancer II/core promoter elements. These mutations of the X gene coding region may lead to suppression of replication and expression of HBV DNAs.

To establish a reliable set of RA risk variants, we systematically classified common variants identified in GWASs by the degree of reproducibility among independent studies.

Interestingly, majority of the intra-population-reproduced variants from European and East Asian populations were not common in two populations, but their nearby genes appeared to be the components of common pathways. Furthermore, a tool to predict the individual's genetic risk of RA was developed to facilitate personalized medicine and preventive health care.

To examine the effects of SNPs in CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, IGF2BP2, HHEX, SLC30A8, PKN2, LOC387761, and KCNQ1 on risk of T2DM in Chinese, Malays, and Asian-Indians in Singapore. We genotyped these candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in subjects from three major ethnic groups in Asia, namely, the Chinese (2196 controls and 1541 cases), Malays (2257 controls and 1076 cases), and Asian-Indians (364 controls and 246 cases). We also performed a metaanalysis of our results with published studies in East Asians. In Chinese, SNPs in CDKAL1 [odds ratio (OR) = 1.19; P = 2 x 10(-4)], HHEX (OR = 1.15; P = 0.013), and KCNQ1 (OR = 1.21; P = 3 x 10(-4)) were significantly associated with T2DM. Among Malays, SNPs in CDKN2A/B (OR = 1.22; P = 3.7 x 10(-4)), HHEX (OR = 1.12; P = 0.044), SLC30A8 (OR = 1.12; P = 0.037), and KCNQ1 (OR = 1.19-1.25; P = 0.003-2.5 x 10(-4)) showed significant association with T2DM. The combined analysis of the three ethnic groups revealed significant associations between SNPs in CDKAL1 (OR = 1.13; P = 3 x 10(-4)), CDKN2A/B (OR = 1.16; P = 9 x 10(-5)), HHEX (OR = 1.14; P = 6 x 10(-4)), and KCNQ1 (OR = 1.16-1.20; P = 3 x 10(-4) to 3 x 10(-6)) with T2DM. SLC30A8 (OR = 1.06; P = 0.039) showed association only after adjustment for gender and body mass index. Metaanalysis with data from other East Asian populations showed similar effect sizes to those observed in populations of European ancestry. SNPs at T2DM susceptibility loci identified through GWAS in populations of European ancestry show similar effects in Asian populations. Failure to detect these effects across different populations may be due to issues of power owing to limited sample size, lower minor allele frequency, or differences in genetic effect sizes.", "title": "Polymorphisms identified through genome-wide association studies and their associations with type 2 diabetes in Chinese, Malays, and Asian-Indians in Singapore.", "pmid": "19892838", "id": "1352"},
{"abstract": "Warfarin is a commonly used anticoagulant with a narrow therapeutic range and large interindividual differences in dosing requirements. Previously, studies have identified that the interindividual variability was influenced by varieties of factors, including age, body size, vitamin K intake, interacting medications, as well as genetic variants. We aimed to investigate the effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the interindividual variability of warfarin dose requirements in Chinese patients. The study population consisted of 300 patients with a stable maintenance dose of warfarin. We examined SNPs in eight genes involving in the biotransformation and mode of action of warfarin (i.e., CYP4F2, CYP2C19, APOE, CALU, EPHX1, PROC, CYP2C9, and GGCX) using the SNaPshot assay. The mean daily warfarin dose in patients carrying CYP2C19 rs3814637CC, CYP2C9 rs1057910AA, and GGCX rs699664AA genotype was 3.39, 3.34, and 3.51\u2009mg/day, respectively, which was higher than those carrying CYP2C19 rs3814637TT, CYP2C9 rs1057910CC, and rs699664GG genotype (2.00, 0.81, and 3.09\u2009mg/day, respectively).

{"abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication, absence or delay in language development, and stereotyped or repetitive behaviors. Genetic studies show that neurexin-neuroligin (NRXN-NLGN) pathway genes contribute susceptibility to ASD, which include cell adhesion molecules NLGN3, NLGN4 and scaffolding proteins SHANK2 and SHANK3. Neuroligin proteins play an important role in synaptic function and trans-synaptic signaling by interacting with presynaptic neurexins. Shank proteins are scaffolding molecules of excitatory synapses, which function as central organizers of the postsynaptic density. Sequence level mutations and structural variations in these genes have been identified in ASD cases, while few studies were performed in Chinese population. In this study, we examined the copy numbers of four genes NLGN4, NLGN3, SHANK2, and SHANK3 in 285 ASD cases using multiplex fluorescence competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We also screened the regulatory region including the promoter region and 5'/3' untranslated regions (UTR) and the entire coding region of NLGN4 in a cohort of 285 ASD patients and 384 controls by direct sequencing of genomic DNA using the Sanger method. DNA copy number calculation in four genes showed no deletion or duplication in our cases. No missense mutations in NLGN4 were identified in our cohort. Association analysis of 6 common SNPs in NLGN4 did not find significant difference between ASD cases and controls.

{"abstract": "The Pro12Ala polymorphism of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 (PPARgamma2) gene has been reported to predict a lower risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, its effect on the lipid profile has been disputable. Among low-density lipoproteins, small dense low-density lipoprotein (sdLDL) particles have been linked to a greater risk for coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the genetic effect of the Pro12Ala polymorphism in the PPARgamma2 gene on the presence of sdLDL in the general Japanese population. In 379 subjects (aged 54 +/- 13 years), body mass index, percentage of body fat, blood pressure, and biochemical profiles were measured. Pro12Ala polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The area of sdLDL subfractions (sdLDL4-7) was analyzed by high-resolution polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The frequency of the Ala12 allele in PPARgamma2 was 0.04. There was no difference in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels between genotypes. However, subjects with the X/Ala genotype (Pro/Ala + Ala/Ala) had significantly higher serum triglyceride levels (P = .001) and a larger area of sdLDL4-7 (P = .002) than those with the Pro/Pro genotype. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the Ala12 allele was a significant variable contributing to the variance in the increased area of sdLDL4-7 (P = .040). In conclusion, the Pro12Ala polymorphism in the PPARgamma2 gene was positively associated with an enlarged area of sdLDL4-7.

Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in exons of TLR2 and TLR4. The case-control analysis revealed that the frequency of the C/C genotype at base-pair position +3725 in TLR4 was significantly higher in both the moderate and the severe periodontitis patient group than in the control group.

In the present study, we evaluated exposure to the EDC, bisphenol A (BPA), in 172 Koreans in relation to biomarkers of susceptibility and effect. The subjects completed questionnaires, which documented occupation, education, lifestyle factors, potential sources of BPA-exposure, and the occurrence of self-diagnosed endocrine disorders. None of the subjects were occupationally exposed to BPA; however, urinary levels of conjugated BPA, determined by HPLC/FD, ranged from 0.03-62.4 microg/l (median, 7.86). The frequencies of potential susceptibility biomarkers, the UGT1A6-Arg184Ser and the SULT1A1-Arg213His polymorphisms, were not associated with urinary BPA levels, either as single genes or in combination. Indirect effects of BPA exposure on the susceptibility to mutagens were evaluated by comparing urinary BPA concentrations with MNNG-induced sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) in lymphocytes cultured from the subjects. BPA exposure showed marginal or significant associations with theSCEs induced by the low doses of MNNG (0-0.4 mM). However, there was no overall association between urinary BPA levels and MNNG-induced frequency at doses ranging from 0.2-0.6 mM. Finally, we did not detect an association between urinary BPA concentration and endocrine-related disorders. Even though we were unable to find a strong association between BPA exposure and a biological response, possibly because of the limited number of subjects, we observed that most of the subjects were exposed to BPA. Therefore, continuous biological monitoring of BPA is a prudent measure to prevent possible BPA-related health risks.", "title": "Urinary concentrations of bisphenol A in relation to biomarkers of sensitivity and effect and endocrine-related health effects.", "pmid": "16795089", "id": "1357"},

We also investigated the possible effect of genetic polymorphisms of NAT2, CYP1A1, and CYP1A2 on stomach cancer.

{"abstract": "We report the results of typing three short tandem repeat (STR) polymorphisms by a multiplex system in three forensically relevant populations of Australia; (i) a general Australian, (ii) a Caucasian, and (iii) an Asian sample. The STRs are tetranucleotide repeats in the following autosomal genes; CSF1PO, TPOX and THO1, and collectively comprise the CTT multiplex (Promega). In all three population samples, each of the loci exhibited genotype frequencies consistent with those expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and, further, there was no significant deviation from random association of alleles across separate loci. These two characteristics, plus the high discrimination power values, demonstrate that the CTT multiplex system is a powerful tool for DNA profiling in Australian jurisdictions. Australian Asians and Caucasians exhibit frequencies of alleles at these three STR loci very similar to those in other Asian and Caucasian samples. While most of the variation exists within any single population, there are still considerable differences between Asians and Caucasians.

{"abstract": "The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 gene is considered to be a major gene associated with predisposition to ankylosing spondylitis (AS); however, studies have demonstrated that non-HLA-B27 genes also contribute substantially to the susceptibility to AS. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs1004819 and rs10889677, of the interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R) gene have been shown to be associated with AS susceptibility in European populations. However, ethnicity factors contribute to population splitting and genetic variation, and ethnic-specific genetic association studies are needed to validate these associations in patients from different ethnic backgrounds. This study therefore aimed to replicate the associations between these two SNPs and AS susceptibility in a Chinese Han population. A total of 195 AS patients and 203 normal controls were recruited in this study. Two IL-23R gene SNPs, rs1004819 and rs10889677 were selected. Genotyping was performed in all subjects using the TaqMan probe method. Genotype and allele frequencies were compared between AS patients and normal controls by \u03c72 tests. There were no significant differences in either the genotype frequencies (TT 36.4%, TC 48.7% and CC 14.9% in AS patients; TT 35.0%, TC 50.0% and CC 15.0% in normal controls) or allele frequencies (T 60.8% and C 39.2% in AS patients; T 60.0% and C 40.0% in normal controls) of rs1004819 between AS patients and normal controls (P\u2009>\u20090.05).

A318V was not polymorphic in the studied population. Only D543N and 3'UTR were more heterozygous. In 274 C/T and 577-18G/A, the allele frequencies showed the predominant type to be the homozygous patterns C/C (94%) and G/G (94%), respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the tuberculosis patients and the healthy control subjects. Despite the high susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients, genotypic frequencies in the HIV-positive patients were not significantly different between tuberculous (n = 29) and non-tuberculous patients (n = 31).

{"abstract": "Type 1 diabetes is characterized by cell-mediated autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Although the disease shows a strong association with HLA class II alleles, other genes may influence the initiation or the rate of progression of the autoimmune process. Recently, it was reported that a polymorphism of the stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) (a kind of chemokine) gene was associated with early onset of type 1 diabetes in Caucasians. Therefore, we examined SDF-1 gene polymorphism in Japanese type 1 diabetes in this study. We examined the SDF-1 gene polymorphism (801G-->A) in 298 unrelated Japanese type 1 diabetic patients and 270 healthy subjects by the TaqMan PCR method. Allelic and genotypic frequencies of the SDF-1 A variants were similar in overall type 1 diabetic patients and healthy subjects. We then stratified the patients by their onset pattern (acute vs. slow onset) and islet-associated autoantibody positivity. However, no significant difference was found among each group of type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, unlike the previous report in \"Caucasian\" type 1 diabetics, the SDF-1 A variant was not associated with early onset of the disease in Japanese type 1 diabetics. The SDF-1 gene polymorphism was not associated with onset age (or onset pattern) of type 1 diabetes in Japanese.

{"abstract": "Many case-control studies on the role of detoxifying enzyme polymorphisms in susceptibility to cancer have identified significant associations, though few have identified effects with sufficient strength to be useful clinically. Odds ratios of 2-3 are the usual finding. Therefore, combinations of risk alleles are increasingly studied in the hope of identifying haplotypes with sufficient biological impact (odds ratio > 15) to warrant further study in a clinical setting. The study of interactions between different detoxifying enzyme loci should be based on biological sense, for example the classical view of two-step xenobiotic detoxification, overlapping substrate specificities, detoxification of molecules derived from the same pathological insult (e.g. detoxification of nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in cigarette smoke) or simultaneous regulation of expression. The rationale behind these mechanisms is discussed. Considerable amounts of data have focused on the interaction between CYP1A1 and GSTM1, particularly in Japanese patients with lung cancer. In this regard there is accumulating evidence suggesting that the combination of GSTM1 null/CYP1A1 rare alleles, particularly in combination with smoking, confers highly significant increased risk. However, there is now some debate on the importance of these data in terms of chemical detoxificatlon, since certain studies suggest that the CYP1A1 polymorphisms that have been investigated do not influence function or expression of the gene. Indeed, the influence of CYP2D6 genetic variation is also disputed, suggesting that these polymorphisms may be acting more as linkage markers than by influencing chemical carcinogenesis themselves. What is clear from the many studies on interactions between detoxifying enzyme polymorphisms is the comparative lack of supporting data on synergism between these genes. Given the inevitable increase in the complexity of studies, a basic explanation of the statistical approaches to the assessment of interactions is included in this chapter. A more detailed statistical/epidemiological assessment is given elsewhere in the book. Since there is an increasing reluctance of journals to publish case-control studies describing the (usually moderate) influence of detoxifying enzyme polymorphisms, it is important that scientists understand what statistical approach is appropriate and address the issue from a novel and clinically significant angle. This is likely to involve multiple genes and subgroup analysis of some kind.", "title": "Interactions between detoxifying enzyme polymorphisms and susceptibility to cancer.", "pmid": "10493264", "id": "1373"},

The genotypes of IL-6 gene promoter-572G/C, -597G/A were detected by fluorescent probe hybridization with fluorescent resonance energy transfer and melting curve techniques in 194 CHD patients and 123 healthy people as control. The effects of genotype on plasma lipids, apoproteins, high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and BMI were also studied. Logistic regression was performed to observe the risk factors of CHD. The results indicated that genotype of IL-6 gene promoter -597G/A polymorphism in 7 cases were GA and were GG in others, whereas no AA genotype had been found and no associations between polymorphism of IL-6 gene -597G/A, BMI and inflammatory factors were found.

Of the diabetes patients, 145 had PDR, 108 had NPDR, and 134 had no retinopathy (noDR). They were all duration matched. Samples were genotyped for rs699947, rs1570360, and rs2010963 polymorphisms. We found a significant association between the A allele at rs699947 with DR (odds ratio = 1.84 (95% confidence interval = 1.28-2.66); P = 0.001 vs. noDR). Patients with NPDR, as well as PDR, had increased incidence of the A allele. The AGG haplotype was more frequently found in patients with DR than in patients with noDR (odds ratio = 4.79 (95% confidence interval = 1.42-16.16); P = 0.006). PDR and NPDR patients exhibited an increased incidence of the AGG haplotype.

Eighty-five Korean patients with PD and 231 unrelated healthy individuals were evaluated to determine if vitamin D receptor gene (VDRG) BsmI polymorphisms were markers for the susceptibility to PD in Korean patients. Each polymorphism was detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based restriction analysis. In addition, the relationship between the BsmI polymorphisms and the clinical manifestations of PD was evaluated. Overexpression of the b allele (91.2 vs. 85.7%; p=0.069) and homozygote bb (84.7 vs. 72.7%; p=0.043) was found in the PD patients compared with the controls.

{"abstract": "It is believed that disruption of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque and subsequent thrombus formation play critical roles in the pathogenesis of cerebral infarction. We simultaneously determined four relatively common genetic variants related to plaque rupture or subsequent local thrombus formation and evaluated the combined effect on cerebral infarction. We enrolled 3,094 Japanese type 2 diabetic subjects (62.7% male; aged 61.5 +/- 8.4 years) and determined their genotypes regarding matrix metalloproteinase 9 C-1562T, coagulation factor XII (F12) C46T, von Willebrand factor (VWF) G-1051A, and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) 675 4G/5G polymorphisms. The diagnosis of cerebral infarction was performed based on history, physical examination, and neuroimaging. The single association analysis revealed that there were no statistically significant associations between each polymorphism and the prevalence of cerebral infarction. Interestingly, the prevalence of cerebral infarction was higher with the increase of the total number of four concomitant unfavorable proatherothrombotic alleles in each subject (P value for linear trend = 0.004). Furthermore, a multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the number of proatherothrombotic alleles was a risk factor for cerebral infarction independently of conventional risk factors (odds ratio for one-point increase in the number of proatherothrombotic allele 1.15 [95% CI 1.05-1.26], P = 0.004). Accumulation of gene polymorphisms related to plaque rupture and thrombus formation is likely associated with the prevalence of cerebral infarction in type 2 diabetic patients, suggesting that the combined information about these variants is useful to assess the risk of cerebral infarction.", "title": "Accumulation of gene polymorphisms related to plaque disruption and thrombosis is associated with cerebral infarction in subjects with type 2 diabetes.", "pmid": "19933990", "id": "1389"},

It has been suggested that Asian patients with HCC have increased susceptibility to hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) related to sorafenib therapy. The authors investigated the association between sorafenib-induced HFSR and genetic polymorphisms in Korean patients with HCC. For this prospective cohort study, the authors enrolled 59 consecutive patients with intermediate stage HCC from 5 centers in Korea. All patients received sorafenib 400 mg twice daily in combination with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Genotyping was performed on a total of 49 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 8 candidate genes (minor allelic frequency \u22655%). Serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays before therapy and 1 month after therapy. During a median treatment period of 18 months, 55 patients (93%) developed sorafenib-induced HFSR, including grade 1 reactions in 15 patients, grade 2 reactions in 27 patients, and grade 3 reaction in 13 patients. The SNPs TNF-\u03b1 -308GG, VEGF -94GG, VEGF 1991CC, VEGF IVS3-28CC, and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1 family-polypeptide A9 (UGT1A9) IVS1-37431AA were associated significantly with the development of high-grade (grade 2 or 3) HFSR in univariate analysis (P < .05).

This study was designed to determine whether the polymorphisms of FCRL3 were associated with susceptibility to BD in a Chinese population mainly with ocular involvement. A case-control study was performed in 245 Chinese BD patients and 289 controls. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; -169C/T, -110A/G, +358C/G, and +1381A/G) in FCRL3 were detected using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP). HLA-B51 genotyping was performed by the PCR sequence specific primers method as described previously. The results showed a significantly higher frequency of the G allele at the -110 site in BD patients compared with that in controls (corrected p=0.044, 75.3% versus 67.5%, chi2=7.72). Haplotype CGCG frequency was significantly higher in patients than in controls (corrected p=0.0096) whereas haplotype TACG frequency was significantly lower in patients compared with controls (corrected p=0.032). There was no relationship between clinical signs and FCRL3 polymorphisms. No significant difference was observed between patients and controls after HLA-B51 stratification concerning the four SNPs.

{"abstract": "Alternative measures of Brassica vegetable consumption (e.g., cabbage) may clarify the association between Brassica and cancer risk. Brassica isothiocyanates (ITCs) are excreted in urine and may provide a sensitive and food-specific dietary biomarker. However, the persistence of ITCs in the body may be brief and dependent on the activity of several Phase II enzymes, raising questions about the relationship between a single ITC measure and habitual dietary patterns. This study investigates the association between urinary ITC excretion and habitual Brassica consumption, estimated by a food frequency questionnaire, among healthy Chinese women enrolled in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study. Participants (n = 347) completed a validated food frequency questionnaire querying habitual dietary intake during the prior 5 years and provided a fasting first-morning urine specimen. Genetic deletion of glutathione S-transferases (GSTM1/GSTT1), and single nucleotide substitutions in GSTP1 (A313G) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1: C609T), were identified from blood DNA. Urinary ITC excretion levels were marginally higher with the GSTT1-null or GSTP1-G/G genotypes (P = 0.07, P = 0.05, respectively). Mean habitual Brassica intake was 98.3 g/day, primarily as bok choy, and Brassica intake significantly increased across quartile categories of ITC levels. The association between habitual Brassica intake and urinary ITC levels was stronger among women with GSTT1-null or GSTP1-A/A genotypes, or NQO1 T-allele, and the interaction was statistically significant across GSTP1 genotype.

This study aimed to determine the association of HSD3\u03b2 and HSD3\u03b22 gene variations with primary aldosteronism in a Taiwanese population. In this case-control cohort, 688 consecutive ethnically matched unrelated individuals including 362 primary aldosteronism and 326 essential hypertension cases were recruited. Nineteen tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across HSD3\u03b21, HSD3\u03b22, and CYP11\u03b22 were genotyped. Expression of HSD3\u03b2 mRNA and immunohistochemical stain of HSD3\u03b2 in the specimens of aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) was compared with that in nonfunctional incidentaloma.

Gallbladder cancer is more common in women, whereas bile duct cancer is more common in men, suggesting that sex hormones may play a role in the etiology of these cancers.

We genotyped six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), four in ESR1 (rs2234693, rs3841686, rs2228480 and rs1801132) and two in ESR2 (rs1256049 and rs4986938).

The association with bile duct cancer was apparent among men (OR = 2.8, 95% CI 1.4-5.7) but not among women (P-heterogeneity = 0.01). Also, the ESR2 rs4986938 (38 bp 3' of STP) GG genotype was associated with a higher risk of bile duct cancer (OR = 3.3, 95% CI 1.3-8.7) compared with the AA genotype, although this estimate was based on a small number of subjects. None of the other SNPs examined was associated with biliary tract cancers or stones. False discovery rate-adjusted P-values were not significant (P > 0.1).

{"abstract": "Aralar is a mitochondrial calcium-regulated aspartate-glutamate carrier mainly distributed in brain and skeletal muscle, and involved in the transport of aspartate from mitochondria to the cytosol of a cell. Studies have shown that the brain N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) levels are greatly decreased in aralar-deficient mice, suggesting that aralar plays an important role in the synthesis of NAA in neuronal cells. Since magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have revealed consistently reduced NAA levels in various brain regions of schizophrenic patients and their unaffected relatives, genes that affect aralar levels or NAA metabolism in the brain may be implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Aralar is encoded by the SLC25A12 gene. In the past this gene has been found to be associated with susceptibility to autism; in this study we tested the hypothesis that SLC25A12 genetic variants confer susceptibility to schizophrenia. Six SLC25A12 polymorphisms were studied in a sample population of 253 people with schizophrenia and 216 normal controls. Significant linkage disequilibrium was obtained among the six polymorphisms. However, neither single marker nor haplotype analysis revealed an association between variants at the SLC25A12 locus and schizophrenia, suggesting that it is unlikely that the SLC25A12 polymorphisms investigated play a substantial role in conferring susceptibility to schizophrenia in the Chinese population.

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms appear to play a role in NPC, because they are essential in the immune response to viruses. We used high-resolution HLA genotyping in a case-control study in Taiwan to systematically evaluate the association between various HLA alleles and NPC. We matched 366 NPC case patients to 318 control subjects by age, sex, and geographic residence. Participants were interviewed and provided blood samples for genotyping. High-resolution (polymerase chain reaction-based) genotyping of HLA class I (A and B) and II (DRB1, DQA1, DQB1, and DPB1) genes was performed in two phases. In phase I, 210 case patients and 183 control subjects were completely genotyped. In phase II, alleles associated with NPC in the phase I analysis were evaluated in another 156 case patients and 135 control subjects. Extended haplotypes were inferred. We found a consistent association between HLA-A*0207 (common among Chinese but not among Caucasians) and NPC (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5 to 3.5) but not between HLA-A*0201 (most common HLA-A2 allele in Caucasians) and NPC (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.55 to 1.2). Individuals with HLA-B*4601, which is in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-A*0207, had an increased risk for NPC (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.2 to 2.5) as did individuals with HLA-A*0207 and HLA-B*4601 (OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.7 to 4.4).

The restriction of the association of HLA-A2 with NPC to HLA-A*0207 probably explains previously observed associations of HLA-A2 with NPC among Chinese but not Caucasians.

ERCC1 (Excision repair cross complementation group 1) is located on chromosome 19q13.2-3 and participates in the crucial steps of Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER); moreover, we determined that one of its polymorphisms, ERCC1 rs11615, is a biomarker for CBP susceptibility in our previous report. Our aim is to further explore the deeper association between some genetic variations related to ERCC1 polymorphisms and CBP risk. Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of XRCC1 (X-ray repair cross-complementing 1), CD3EAP (CD3e molecule, epsilon associated protein), PPP1R13L (protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 13 like), XPB (Xeroderma pigmentosum group B), XPC (Xeroderma pigmentosum group C) and XPF (Xeroderma pigmentosum group F) were genotyped by the Snapshot and TaqMan-MGB\u00ae probe techniques, in a study involving 102 CBP patients and 204 controls. The potential interactions between these SNPs and lifestyle factors, such as smoking and drinking, were assessed using a stratified analysis. An XRCC1 allele, rs25487, was related to a higher risk of CBP (P<0.001) even after stratifying for potential confounders. Carriers of the TT genotype of XRCC1 rs1799782 who were alcohol drinkers (OR = 8.000; 95% CI: 1.316-48.645; P = 0.022), male (OR = 9.333; 95% CI: 1.593-54.672; P = 0.019), and had an exposure of \u226412 years (OR = 2.612; 95% CI: 1.048-6.510; P = 0.035) had an increased risk of CBP.

The frequency distribution of alleles at all these sites was found to be significantly different between the South Asian and the Swedish samples (deletion allele: 0.20 v. 0.31, X+ (presence of XbaI cutting site): 0.29 v. 0.55, R- (absence of EcoRI cutting site): 0.11 v. 0.19, Ser4311: 0.45 v. 0.19). The distribution of allele frequencies at the VNTR site was bimodal in both populations. However, in South Asians, the most common allele was a 35 repeat unit allele, whilst in the Swedish sample, and in all other reports from Caucasian samples the 37 repeat unit allele was the most frequent (South Asian v.

Furthermore, four new alleles at the apo B gene 3'-VNTR site (15, 17, 32, 38 repeat unit alleles) were observed in South Asians, of which two (15 and 17 repeat unit alleles) were well outside the bimodal distribution. In both samples, strong linkage disequilibrium and allelic association were detected between alleles at the 3'-VNTR and each of the other sites, and also between the ins/del and XbaI sites and between the XbaI and Asn4311----Ser sites.

{"abstract": "The P2X7 receptor is a member of the P2X family of adenosine 5'-triphosphate-gated cation channels. Several recent studies have demonstrated that this receptor is involved in mechanisms related to pain and inflammation. However, unknown is whether polymorphisms of the P2RX7 gene that encodes the human P2X7 receptor influence pain sensitivity and analgesic effects of opioids. The P2RX7 gene is known to be highly polymorphic. Thus, the present study examined associations between fentanyl sensitivity and polymorphisms in the P2RX7 gene in 355 Japanese patients who underwent painful orofacial cosmetic surgery. We first conducted linkage disequilibrium (LD) analyses for 55 reported single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the region within and around the P2RX7 gene using genomic samples from 100 patients. In our samples, 42 SNPs were polymorphic, and a total of five LD blocks with six Tag SNPs (rs2708092, rs1180012, rs1718125, rs208293, rs1718136, and rs7132846) were observed. Thus, we further analyzed associations between genotypes/haplotypes of these Tag SNPs and clinical data using a total of 355 samples. In the genotype-based association study, only the rs1718125 G>A SNP tended to be associated with higher pain scores on a visual analog scale 24 h after surgery (VAS24). The haplotype-based association study showed that subjects with homozygous haplotype No.3 (GTAAAC; estimated frequency: 15.0%) exhibited significantly higher cold pain sensitivity and lower analgesic effects of fentanyl for acute cold pain in the cold pressor test. Conversely, subjects who carried haplotype No.1 (ACGGAC; estimated frequency: 24.5%) tended to exhibit lower cold pain sensitivity and higher analgesic effects of fentanyl. Furthermore, subjects with homozygous haplotype No.2 (GCGGAC; estimated frequency: 22.9%) exhibited significantly lower VAS24 scores. Cold pain sensitivity and analgesic effects of fentanyl were related to the SNP and haplotypes of the P2RX7 gene. The patients with the rs1718125 G>A SNP tended to show higher VAS24 scores. Moreover, the combination of polymorphisms from the 5'-flanking region to exon 5 recessively affected cold pain sensitivity and analgesic effects of opioids for acute cold pain. The present findings shed light on the involvement of P2RX7 gene polymorphisms in naive cold pain sensitivity and analgesic effects of fentanyl.", "title": "Haplotypes of P2RX7 gene polymorphisms are associated with both cold pain sensitivity and analgesic effect of fentanyl.", "pmid": "25472448", "id": "1423"},

{"abstract": "The susceptibility for the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is related to environmental, hormonal, genetic, and immunological factors. Numerous genes have been linked to the emergence of SLE, including vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene that synthesizes the receptor of vitamin D. Several polymorphisms have been described since the discovery of this gene, and their effects on VDR activity are still poorly understood. Vitamin D's biological functions are mediated by VDR. Vitamin D exerts many actions on the immune system, and several studies have suggested its role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. SLE patients have low blood levels of vitamin D, which raises the possibility of association between the deficiency of this vitamin and the onset of the disease. BsmI and FokI polymorphic variants seem to be related to the onset of the disease in Asian patients. In this article, we review the aspects related to the metabolism and immunoregulatory effects of vitamin D, VDR, and main polymorphisms involving the VDR gene and the relationship between vitamin D levels and its receptor with SLE.", "title": "Vitamin D and polymorphisms of VDR gene in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.", "pmid": "22692397", "id": "1426"},
{"abstract": "The incidence of lung cancer has been increasing over recent decades. Previous studies show that polymorphisms of the genes involved in carcinogen-detoxication, DNA repair and cell cycle control compose of the risk factors for lung cancer. Recent observations reveal that the components of CAK: Cdk7, MAT1 and cyclin H, may play important roles in cell cycle control, transcriptional control, and DNA repairing process, all of which are important in carcinogenesis. To test whether the genetic variants of CAK genes modify the risk of lung cancer, we compared the manifestation of 25 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the haplotypes of Cdk7, MAT1 and cyclin H between 500 patients with lung cancer and 517 healthy controls. Our results indicated that the genotype frequency of MAT1 79023A/G (p = 0.042) and MAT1 85693C/T (p = 0.005) of cases significantly differed from those of the controls. Further analyses revealed that cyclin H 11817C/T, MAT1 12199A/G, MAT1 70650A/G, MAT1 79023A/G and MAT1 85693C/T significantly influenced the susceptibility of lung cancer in a dominant genetic model while cyclin H 12128A/T and MAT1 42172A/G did in a recessive model. Strongest association between cyclin H alleles and lung cancer patients was found in the non-smoke subpopulation. The haplotype 'TAC' (p = 0.007) increased and the haplotype 'TTC' (p = 0.043) decreased the risk of lung cancer. The potential gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions on lung cancer risk was evaluated using MDR software. A significant interaction between the three CAK component genes was identified and the combination of smoking status and genetic factors barely increased the accuracy.

Several host genetic and viral factors have been associated with the risk of HAM/TSP. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a prognostic model for HAM/TSP developed in Japan in a Peruvian population of 71 HAM/TSP patients and 94 asymptomatic carriers (ACs). This model included age, proviral load (PVL), the presence of HLA-A*02 and HLA-Cw*08 alleles, SDF-1 +801, and TNF-alpha -863 polymorphisms, and viral subgroup. We describe frequencies for the four host genetic markers and demonstrate the presence of the HTLV-1 tax B subgroup in Peru. Using cross-validation, we show that the predictive ability of the prognostic model, as characterized by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), does not differ from a model containing PVL only (both AUC = 0.74). We found some suggestive evidence of a protective effect of the HLA-A*02 allele but failed to replicate the associations with the other three genetic markers and with viral subgroup.

The effects of habitual exercise on the measured lipid parameters were compared in each genotype group. No association between the genotypes in the PPAR\u03b3 gene and the biochemical data was found. However, the serum triglyceride levels and the SCD1 indices in RBC membranes were significantly higher in the participants who carried the major rs2938392 allele (A/A) and did not habitually exercise than in those who did exercise.

{"abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of resistance to second-line antituberculosis (anti-TB) drugs and its association with resistance-related mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated in China. In the present study, we collected 380 isolates from a population-based study in China and tested the drug susceptibility to first- and selected second-line drugs. These results were compared with polymorphisms in the DNA sequences of genes associated with drug resistance and MIC values of the studied second-line drugs. Of 43 multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates, 13 showed resistance to fluoroquinolones or injectable second-line drugs (preextensively drug-resistant TB [pre-XDR-TB]), and 4 were resistant to both and thus defined as extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). Age and previous TB therapy, including use of second-line drugs, were two independent factors associated with increased resistance to both first- and second-line drugs. Molecular analysis identified the most frequent mutations in the resistance-associated genes: D94G in gyrA (29.1%) and A1401G in rrs (30.8%). Meanwhile, all 4 XDR-TB isolates had a mutation in gyrA, and 3 of them carried the A1401G mutation in rrs. Mutations in gyrA and rrs were associated with high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones and the second-line injectable drugs. In addition to the identification of resistance-associated mutations and development of a rapid molecular test to diagnose the second-line drug resistance, it should be a priority to strictly regulate the administration of second-line drugs to maintain their efficacy to treat multidrug-resistant TB.

We pooled published literature from PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science and calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the strength of associations using fixed effects models and random effects models. Twenty relevant case-control and cohort studies of the 3 related SNPs were identified.

Results did not differ when the subjects were divided into two age groups (< or = 59 and > or = 60 years). Covariate-adjusted odds ratios for hypertension for presence of the D allele were close to the null value of one.

To analyze the polymorphism distribution in Japanese patients with breast cancer, a molecular genotyping method using a polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used. Based on an analysis of 201 Japanese patients with breast cancer and 352 healthy control subjects, a significant difference was observed in either the distribution of genotypes (p=0.03) or allele frequencies between the two groups (p=0.01). The relative risk of breast cancer for genotypes (COMT(Met/Met) and COMT(Val/Met)) including the variant allele (COMT(Met)) was 1.47 compared to the wild allele (COMT(Val)) and homozygote (COMT(Val/Val)). Furthermore, the distribution of genotypes in post-menopausal patients with breast cancer showed a significant difference with that of healthy subjects of the same menopausal status (p=0.01). No significant difference was found between the distribution of genotypes and clinicopathological features of the cancer.

Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age, height, body weight, time since menopause, smoking status, body fat, lean mass, and either lumbar spine or total body BMD, demonstrated that the frequency of the C allele in subjects with spinal osteophytosis was significantly greater than that in those without this condition. Comparison among control, osteoporosis, and spinal osteophytosis groups also revealed that the C allele was more prevalent in subjects with osteophytosis than in controls, even after adjustment for BMD. In contrast, as previously shown, the frequency of the C allele was lower in osteoporosis patients than in controls.

{"abstract": "Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and \u03b23 adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) genes play central roles in the thermogenesis of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans. However, the importance of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in both genes during the development of obesity is controversial. Although active BAT in adult humans is frequently observed in the winter season, the effects of sampling season have not been taken into consideration in previous association studies. Here, we tested the associations of UCP1 -3826A/G and ADRB3 Trp64Arg with body mass index (BMI) and visceral fat area (VFA) in 3013 Japanese adults sampled during different seasons. Association between SNPs and the obesity-related traits were assessed using multiple linear regression models, including sex, age, physical activity, and genotypes. Both SNPs did not show significant associations in the models based on the entire cohort. However, in subsets comprising individuals mainly sampled from winter to spring, UCP1 showed significant associations with VFA (P = 0.0098) and VFA adjusted for BMI (P = 0.0128). Moreover, the effects of UCP1 on VFA were strongly negatively correlated with outdoor temperature (P = 0.00011), but not with night length (P = 0.039). ADRB3 did not show these associations, but an additive effect with UCP1 was observed for VFA adjusted for BMI (P = 0.0067). Subsets sampled in the hot season did not show significant associations for both SNPs. The season-specific effects of UCP1 on VFA were consistent with a previous finding that active BAT was more frequently found in winter than in summer, and supported the importance of cold stress in BAT activation and the significance of BAT in the development of obesity in adult humans.", "title": "Seasonal effects of UCP1 gene polymorphism on visceral fat accumulation in Japanese adults.", "pmid": "24086366", "id": "1461"},

Controls were 767 women without rhinoconjunctivitis according to the ISAAC criteria who had not been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis by a doctor. Compared with women with the TT genotype of SNP rs40401, those with the CC genotype had a significantly increased risk of rhinoconjunctivitis: the adjusted OR was 1.52 (95% CI: 1.05-2.19). This positive relationship was significant under the additive model: the adjusted OR was 1.23 (95% CI: 1.02-1.47).

The aim of this study was to clarify the effect of the p22PHOX C242T polymorphism, an essential component of NADPH oxidase in the risk of gastroduodenal diseases, on the severity of H. pylori-induced gastritis in a Japanese population. The study comprised 436 patients attending the Endoscopy Center of Fujita Health University Hospital. The p22PHOX C242T polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Gastritis scores of antral gastric mucosa were assessed according to the updated Sydney system. The 436 patients represented 106 gastric ulcers (24.3%), 48 duodenal ulcers (11.0%), and 282 non-ulcer subjects (64.7%). No association was found between p22PHOX polymorphism and the risk of ulcer diseases compared to non-ulcer subjects. However, among H. pylori-positive subjects, the degree of intestinal metaplasia tended to be lower in 242T carriers aged more than 60 years (p=0.0488). The same allele also decreased the risk of developing a more severe intestinal metaplasia in H. pylori-positive female subjects (p=0.0441).

{"abstract": "The capacity of plants and plant cells to produce large amounts of recombinant protein has been well established. Due to advantages in terms of speed and yield, attention has recently turned towards the use of transient expression systems, including viral vectors, to produce proteins of pharmaceutical interest in plants. However, the effects of such high level expression from viral vectors and concomitant effects on host cells may affect the quality of the recombinant product. To assess the quality of antibodies transiently expressed to high levels in plants, we have expressed and characterised the human anti-HIV monoclonal antibody, 2G12, using both replicating and non-replicating systems based on deleted versions of Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) RNA-2. The highest yield (approximately 100 mg/kg wet weight leaf tissue) of affinity purified 2G12 was obtained when the non-replicating CPMV-HT system was used and the antibody was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Glycan analysis by mass-spectrometry showed that the glycosylation pattern was determined exclusively by whether the antibody was retained in the ER and did not depend on whether a replicating or non-replicating system was used. Characterisation of the binding and neutralisation properties of all the purified 2G12 variants from plants showed that these were generally similar to those of the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell-produced 2G12. Overall, the results demonstrate that replicating and non-replicating CPMV-based vectors are able to direct the production of a recombinant IgG similar in activity to the CHO-produced control. Thus, a complex recombinant protein was produced with no apparent effect on its biochemical properties using either high-level expression or viral replication. The speed with which a recombinant pharmaceutical with excellent biochemical characteristics can be produced transiently in plants makes CPMV-based expression vectors an attractive option for biopharmaceutical development and production.", "title": "Rapid transient production in plants by replicating and non-replicating vectors yields high quality functional anti-HIV antibody.", "pmid": "21103044", "id": "1466"},
{"abstract": "Alanine to threonine substitution at codon 54 of the fatty acid-binding protein 2 (FABP2) gene was recently shown to be associated with insulin resistance in Pima Indians. It has been hypothesized that the mutation may result in enhanced intestinal up-take of fatty acids, and thereby an impairment of insulin action. We analysed the association of the Ala54Thr substitution with insulin sensitivity and abdominal fat thickness in 395 Japanese men aged 50.5 +/- 8.8 years (mean +/- SD) with a body mass index of 24.4 +/- 3.0 kg/m2. The frequency of the Thr54 allele was 0.34. Although the polymorphism was not significantly associated with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, subjects homozygous for the Thr54 allele had higher basal insulin levels. Analysis by homeostasis model assessment showed an association between the amino acid substitution and greater insulin resistance, and slightly higher beta-cell function. Oral glucose tolerance tests performed in 392 subjects without fasting hyperglycaemia showed higher 2-h insulin concentrations in individuals homozygous for the Thr54 allele when compared with heterozygotes or homozygotes for the Ala54 allele. No significant association was obtained between the polymorphism of the FABP2 gene and body mass index. However, ultrasound measurements of abdominal fat thickness revealed a greater accumulation of intra-abdominal fat in subjects homozygous for the Thr54 allele, whereas subcutaneous fat thickness was not associated with the polymorphism. These observations suggest that the Ala54Thr substitution in the FABP2 gene is associated with insulin resistance in Japanese men, and that visceral fat accumulation might be involved in the impaired insulin action associated with the substitution.", "title": "Association between Ala54Thr substitution of the fatty acid-binding protein 2 gene with insulin resistance and intra-abdominal fat thickness in Japanese men.", "pmid": "9222651", "id": "1467"},

The IOP response to latanoprost was evaluated by percent IOP reduction (%\u0394IOP) in the treated eye with the formula %\u0394IOP\u2009=\u2009(Baseline IOP values\u2009-\u2009IOP values posttreatment)\u2009/\u2009Baseline IOP values\u2009\u00d7\u2009100 %. Polymorphisms in PTGS1 (rs3842787 and rs10306114), PTGFR (rs3753380 and rs3766355), and MRP4 (rs11568658 and rs11568668) genes were detected by direct DNA sequencing. The differences among %\u0394IOP of genotypes or haplotypes were obtained by use of the Mann-Whitney U test. Association analyses were performed by multiple linear regression analysis. Latanoprost were prescribed to 63 subjects, 60 of which met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the current study. Notably, the %\u0394IOP in the rs11568658 GT heterozygous genotype was 10.4 %\u0394IOP lower than that of GG homozygous wild-type on day 7 (15.7 \u00b1 2.52 vs. 26.1 \u00b1 2.88, P=0.003), and the corresponding results in the rs10306114 AG heterozygous genotype and AT haplotype constructed by rs3753380 and rs3766355 on day 7 were 7.2 and 10.3 %\u0394IOP (P<0.05).

To date, large scale replication studies using populations with known differences in genome-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern have not been undertaken. To address this issue, we tested associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the seven novel loci and plasma lipid profiles in 21 010 Japanese individuals. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that the rs3812316 in MLXIPL was strongly associated with triglyceride concentrations (p approximately 3.0x10(-11), 7.1 mg/dl decrease per minor C allele) and that rs599839 in CELSR2/PSRC1/SORT1 was strongly associated with LDL cholesterol concentrations (p approximately 3.1x10(-11), 4.7 mg/dl decrease per minor G allele) in the Japanese population. SNPs near ANGPTL3, TRIB1 and GALNT2 showed evidence for associations with triglyceride concentrations (3.6x10(-6)<p<5.1x10(-5)).

Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), A-842G and C50T, exhibited increased sensitivity to aspirin and had lower prostaglandin synthesis capacity, lacking statistical significance in the association with bleeding peptic ulcer. A recent Japanese study indicated that the number of COX-1-1676T alleles was a significant risk factor for peptic ulcer in users of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Carrying the CYP2C9 variants is reported a significantly increased risk of non-aspirin NSAID-related GI bleeding. The polymorphisms of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) have been associated with development of peptic ulcer or gastric cancer. In a recent investigation, carriage of the IL-1beta-511 T allele was significantly associated with peptic ulcer among low-dose aspirin users.

After adjustment for age, two of the 17 loci were significantly associated with prostate cancer risk, while the other 15 loci were suggestively associated with prostate cancer risk in this population. The strongest associations were found for chromosome 8q24 Region 2 (rs1016343: OR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.35-3.20, P = 9.4 x 10(-4)) and 8q24 Region 1 (rs10090154: OR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.31-3.28, P = 0.002); additional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) assessed in these two 8q24 regions were also significant (OR(Region2) = 1.92-2.05, P = 9.4 x 10(-4) to 0.003, and OR(Region1) = 1.77-1.81, P = 0.01 for all SNPs).

In summary, positive results have been shown on the search for polymorphic variants influencing the risk of NPC. This meta-analysis provides evidence of the association between CCND1 G870A polymorphism and NPC risk, supporting the hypothesis that CCND1 870A allele probably acts as an important NPC protective factor in Caucasians but not in Asians.

The rationale for this meta-analysis was to determine whether CYP2E1*2 (c2) variant allele of CYP2E1 increases gastric cancer risk, especially by interacting with smoking, alcohol and other metabolic gene polymorphisms. Two investigators independently searched the Medline and Embase databases. A qualitative scoring of papers was applied to their evaluation. Authors of the identified papers were contacted to obtain data on the mentioned co-exposures. A measurement of the biological interaction among two putative risk factors was estimated by the attributable proportion (AP) due to interaction. We identified 13 case-control studies, which included 2066 gastric cancer cases and 2754 controls. Using the random effects model, we found no association between PstI/RsaI genotype and gastric cancer risk [odds ratio (OR) = 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.79-1.18) for c2 allele carriers and OR = 1.36 (95% CI: 0.82-2.25) for c2 homozygotes compared with homozygotes wild-type].

In this study, we compare the performance of several statistical approaches for assessing rare variant associations across multiple ethnicities. We also explore how different ethnic sampling fractions perform, including single-ethnicity studies and studies that sample up to four ethnicities. We conducted simulations based on targeted sequencing data from 4,611 women in four ethnicities (African, European, Japanese American, and Latina). As with single-ethnicity studies, burden tests had greater power when all causal rare variants were deleterious, and variance component-based tests had greater power when some causal rare variants were deleterious and some were protective. Multiethnic studies had greater power than single-ethnicity studies at many loci, with inclusion of African Americans providing the largest impact. On average, studies including African Americans had as much as 20% greater power than equivalently sized studies without African Americans.

A slight attenuation of anti-HIV-2 activity was also observed in TRIM5\u03b1 with 249D. The predicted secondary structure of the linker region suggested that the 249D substitution extended the \u03b1-helix in the neighboring coiled-coil domain, suggesting that human TRIM5\u03b1 with 249D may lose the flexibility required for optimal recognition of retroviral capsid protein.

{"abstract": "We investigated the association of the polymorphisms of interferon-gamma gene (IFNG) CA-repeat and IL-10-592A/C with clinical heterogeneity of type I diabetes as well as susceptibility to type I diabetes. Two hundred seven Japanese type I diabetic patients and 160 healthy control subjects were studied in this case-control study. No significant differences of global IFNG allele frequencies were found between controls and type I diabetic patients, and between each subgroup of the patients and controls. When compared with controls, the a12 allele was increased in the patients with age at onset <25 years (p 0.0241, p(c) = 0.1205), and a significant increased frequency of the a12 positive genotype was observed in the patients with age at onset <25 years (p(c) = 0.0121). There were no differences of IL-10-592 genotype and allele frequencies between controls and type I diabetes. However, the frequency of the -592*C allele was significantly increased in the patients with highly positive-GADab compared with controls (p(c) = 0.0060) or compared with the GADab-negative type I patients (p(c) = 0.0276). These results suggest that the IFNG CA-repeat and the IL-10-592A/C polymorphisms are not strong determinants of susceptibility to the development of type I diabetes in Japanese individuals. However, both the IFNG CA-repeat and the IL-10-592A/C polymorphisms are associated with clinical heterogeneity in type I diabetes.", "title": "Polymorphisms of interferon-gamma gene CA-repeat and interleukin-10 promoter region (-592A/C) in Japanese type I diabetes.", "pmid": "11821159", "id": "1498"},

We tested the genetic association between bipolar disorder and HSP90B1 by case-control studies in two independent Japanese sample sets and by a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) in NIMH Genetics initiative bipolar trio samples (NIMH trios). We also performed gene expression analysis of HSP90B1 in lymphoblastoid cells. Among the 11 SNPs tested, rs17034977 showed significant association in both Japanese sample sets. The frequency of the SNP was lower in NIMH samples than in Japanese samples and there was no significant association in NIMH trios.

Recently a small genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified DCC to be significantly associated with gallbladder cancer (GBC) susceptibility in a Japanese population sample. However, the study sample size was small and lacked independent replication. Therefore, the present study was carried out to replicate the association of two GWAS identified DCC SNPs (A>Grs4078288, C>Trs7504990) and two other SNPs (C>Grs2229080 and A>Grs714) previously associated with various cancers. The study was accomplished in 406 GBC cases and 260 healthy control samples from North India. Genotyping was carried out by PCR-RFLP and Taqman genotyping assays. Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS ver16 and functional prediction of these variants was carried out using Bioinformatics tools (FAST-SNP, F-SNP). We did not observe association with GWAS-identified SNPs of DCC but other SNPs showed significant association. In addition, a DCC haplotype Grs2229080-Ars4078288-Crs7504990-Ars714 conferred high risk of GBC in India. The haplotype associated risk was independent of gallstone, sex or tobacco usages which are well-known modifiers of GBC risk. Further analysis suggested DCC A>Grs714 as a major risk conferring SNP in the Indian population. This study re-affirms the role of plausible tumor suppressor DCC variants, in gallbladder carcinogenesis and the risk haplotype may be explored as a useful marker for GBC susceptibility.", "title": "DCC (deleted in colorectal carcinoma) gene variants confer increased susceptibility to gallbladder cancer (Ref.

To shed light on these inconclusive findings, a meta-analysis of all available studies relating the C677T polymorphism to the risk of developing DN was conducted. The PubMed database was searched, and case-control studies investigating the association between MTHFR C677T gene polymorphism and DN were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis included 15 studies, of which 8 involved Caucasians and 5 East Asians; 11 studies involved subjects with type 2 diabetes and 4 with type 1 diabetes. The main analysis (all studies) revealed significant heterogeneity between the studies (P(Q)<0.01) and a marginal association between the 677T allele and the risk of developing DN; the random effects (RE) pooled odds ratio (OR) was 1.30 (1.03-1.64). However, the sensitivity analysis (exclusion of studies not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium) produced non-significant results. The recessive model derived significant results in main analysis [fixed effects (FE) OR=1.32 (1.10-1.58), P(Q)=0.27], and in type 2 diabetes [FE OR=1.30 (1.06-1.60), P(Q)=0.38].

To assess allelic influence of the VDR gene on BMD, we determined changes in 1/6-radial-BMD by several repeat measurements in the same subjects for about ten years and analyzed VDR polymorphism of BsmI restriction enzyme in 53 normal healthy Japanese women (age: 50.3 +/- 4.7 years, mean +/- SD). Twenty-seven (age: 53.2 +/- 4.7 years) of the subjects were post-menopausal (POST group). Among these 53 subjects, the distribution of bb, Bb and BB genotypes was 64.2%, 34% and 1.9%, respectively. The genotype frequencies in this study were very similar to those in previous reports concerning other Japanese women. There was no difference between the b group (women with bb genotype) and B group (women with BB or Bb genotype) in age, body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), years since menopause, serum osteocalcin and serum alkaline phosphatase values. In the POST group, BMD of the B group at menopause was lower than that of the b group (p < 0.05). About ten years after menopause, BMD did not differ significantly between these groups because the decrease in BMD in the b group was larger than that in the B group. Regarding changes in BMD in the POST group for four years after menopause, BMD of the b group was significantly decreased compared with the B group (p < 0.01).

{"abstract": "Multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2, ABCC2) plays an important role in the biliary clearance of a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous toxic compounds. Therefore, polymorphisms and mutations in the MRP2 gene may affect individual susceptibility to hepatotoxic reactions. Associations between genetic variations of MRP2 and toxic hepatitis were investigated using integrated population genetic analysis and functional molecular studies. Using a gene scanning method, 12 polymorphisms and mutations were found in the MRP2 gene in a Korean population. Individual variation at these sites was analyzed by conventional DNA screening in 110 control subjects and 94 patients with toxic hepatitis induced mostly by herbal remedies. When haplotypes were identified, over 85% of haploid genes belonged to the five most common haplotypes. Among these, a haplotype containing the g.-1774delG polymorphism showed a strong association with cholestatic or mixed-type hepatitis, and a haplotype containing the g.-1549G>A, g.-24C>T, c.334-49C>T, and c.3972C>T variations was associated with hepatocellular-type hepatitis. A comprehensive functional study of these sites revealed that genetic variations in the promoter of this gene are primarily responsible for the susceptibility to toxic liver injuries. The g.-1774delG variation and the combined variation of g.-1549G>A and g.-24C>T decreased MRP2 promoter activity by 36 and 39%, respectively. In addition, the promoter carrying the g.-1774delG allele showed a defect in the bile acid-induced induction of promoter activity. These results suggest that genetic variations of MRP2 are an important predisposing factor for herbal-induced or drug-induced toxic liver injuries.", "title": "MRP2 haplotypes confer differential susceptibility to toxic liver injury.", "pmid": "17502832", "id": "1517"},
{"abstract": "One-carbon metabolism, in which folate plays an essential role, is involved in DNA methylation and synthesis, and is suspected of impacting on colorectal carcinogenesis. Alcohol is well recognized as a risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) and interactions with one-carbon metabolism have also been suggested. Therefore, functional polymorphisms in genes encoding members of this pathway, MTHFR C677T and A1298C (genes for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase), MTR A2756G (gene for methionine synthase) and TS (gene for thymidylate synthase) tandem repeats polymorphisms, have attracted attention. We conducted a matched case-control study with 257 incident CRC cases and 771 non-cancer controls at the Aichi Cancer Center to clarify associations among folate intake and four polymorphisms with reference to CRC risk. Gene-environment interaction between polymorphisms, drinking and folate consumption was also evaluated. None of the polymorphisms showed any significant impact on CRC risk by genotype alone, but when combined with alcohol consumption the MTHFR 677CC type showed a significantly reduced risk (odds ratio (OR) = 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.23-0.86) (P = 0.01). MTR GG showed increased risk only among drinkers (OR = 3.35, 1.40-8.05) (P = 0.047). TS polymorphism did not show statistical significance by genotype alone, while interaction with drinking was significant (P = 0.028).

However, most ready-made SNP genotyping kits (e.g., those that use TaqMan PCR) are based on the assumption that the SNP is biallelic. Thus, most kits are unsuitable for triallelic SNPs. We have experienced difficulty genotyping an SNP using TaqMan PCR. In the present study, we developed a method of genotyping a triallelic SNP (rs3091244: alleles C, A and T) using TaqMan PCR. We used 2 different genotyping kits: one for C/A allele genotyping, and one for C/T allele genotyping. The results of these 2 kits were combined to complete the genotyping. The subjects were 320 essentially healthy elderly Japanese. The frequencies of the C, A and T alleles were 0.78, 0.155 and 0.065, respectively.

{"abstract": "Endometriosis is one of the most common gynaecological diseases and evidence has suggested that it may be inherited as a complex genetic trait. HOXA10, a homeobox gene, is expressed in the developing uterus and participates in endometrium development and may contribute to endometriosis. In this study, the HOXA10 gene was analysed in 112 patients with endometriosis and in 54 women without endometriosis, as diagnosed laparoscopically. The entire HOXA10 gene was amplified using polymerase chain reaction followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and sequencing. Association between the polymorphism and the clinical parameters of endometriosis were examined. There were 7.23% patients with HOXA10 genetic alterations; however, there was no significant increase in the endometriosis patients compared with the controls. Most of these DNA variants were found to be novel mutations that reside within the HOXA10 homeobox domain. Six variants generate amino acid changes in the protein and one harbours a premature stop codon. It was found that patients with HOXA10 polymorphism were associated with a lower serum cancer antigen-125, a lower American Fertility Society score and less severe obliterated cul-de-sac. It is postulated that genetic alterations in the homeobox domain might lead to less specificity for HOXA10 protein binding to a DNA molecule.", "title": "Genetic alterations of HOXA10 and their effect on the severity of endometriosis in a Taiwanese population.", "pmid": "18339267", "id": "1520"},

{"abstract": "Bone mineral density (BMD) is under genetic control. Some studies in Caucasian and Asian women suggest that polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene are associated with BMD and the rate of postmenopausal bone loss. We determined if similar associations exist in 101 African-American women aged 65 years and older (71 +/- 5 years, mean +/- SD). We also examined the relation between VDR genotype and fractional 45Ca absorption and markers of bone formation (osteocalcin) and resorption (N-telopeptides) in these women. BMD was measured at the proximal femur and whole body at baseline and after 1.9 +/- 0.4 years (femur only) on a Hologic QDR-2000 densitometer using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Calcaneal BMD was measured with single x-ray absorptiometry. VDR gene polymorphisms were defined by the endonucleases BsmI, ApaI, and TaqI. These polymorphisms were not associated with BMD at any skeletal site or with markers of bone turnover. There was a significant interaction between age and VDR genotype where the oldest women (> 70 years) with the TT genotype experienced greater hip bone loss than women with the TT genotype (-2.1%/year vs. -0.4%/year, respectively), whereas heterozygous women experienced an intermediate rate of bone loss (-1.3%/year). Women homozygous for the B allele had 14% lower fractional 45Ca absorption compared with women homozygous for the b allele, although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). We conclude that VDR gene polymorphisms are not associated with BMD or indices of bone turnover in this population of older African-American women.

{"abstract": "Human cancer risk assessment at a genetic level involves the investigation of carcinogen metabolism and DNA adduct formation. Wide interindividual differences in metabolism result in different DNA adduct levels. For this and other reasons, many laboratories have considered DNA adducts to be a measure of the biologically effective dose of a carcinogen. Techniques for studying DNA adducts using chemically specific assays are becoming available. A modification of the 32P-postlabeling assay for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon DNA adducts described here provides potential improvements in quantification. DNA adducts, however, reflect only recent exposure to carcinogens; in contrast, genetic testing for metabolic capacity indicates the extent to which carcinogens can be activated and exert genotoxic effects. Such studies may reflect both separate and integrated risk factors together with DNA adduct levels. A recently described restriction fragment length polymorphism for the CYP1A1, which codes for the cytochrome P450 enzyme primarily responsible for the metabolic activation of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, has been found to be associated with lung cancer risk in a Japanese population.

Much evidence suggests that genetic polymorphisms may modulate serotonergic and noradrenergic function, thereby affecting the treatment efficacy of venlafaxine. The aim of this study was to examine whether polymorphisms in the norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2) associate with remission after venlafaxine treatment for MDD. An 8-week naturalistic treatment study with venlafaxine was carried out in 243 Han Chinese patients with MDD. The patients were screened for seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the SLC6A2 gene. Of the enrolled patients, 161 completed the 8-week treatment. The 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was used to assess the improvement of depressive symptoms in each subject from baseline to the endpoint. For better presentation of time-course change of remission status, a Cox regression analysis for remission incidence during the 8-week treatment was conducted. Between remitters and non-remitters, significant differences in genotype frequencies were observed in five of the investigated SLC6A2 variants (rs28386840, rs1532701, rs40434, rs13333066, rs187714). GCG haplotype (rs40434 - rs13333066 - rs187714) in the SLC6A2 gene showed a association with non-remission.

{"abstract": "Previous studies have emphasized ethnically heterogeneous human leukocyte antigen (HLA) classical allele associations to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk. We fine-mapped RA risk alleles within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in 2782 seropositive RA cases and 4315 controls of Asian descent. We applied imputation to determine genotypes for eight class I and II HLA genes to Asian populations for the first time using a newly constructed pan-Asian reference panel. First, we empirically measured high imputation accuracy in Asian samples. Then we observed the most significant association in HLA-DR\u03b21 at amino acid position 13, located outside the classical shared epitope (Pomnibus = 6.9 \u00d7 10(-135)). The individual residues at position 13 have relative effects that are consistent with published effects in European populations (His > Phe > Arg > Tyr \u2245 Gly > Ser)--but the observed effects in Asians are generally smaller. Applying stepwise conditional analysis, we identified additional independent associations at positions 57 (conditional Pomnibus = 2.2 \u00d7 10(-33)) and 74 (conditional Pomnibus = 1.1 \u00d7 10(-8)). Outside of HLA-DR\u03b21, we observed independent effects for amino acid polymorphisms within HLA-B (Asp9, conditional P = 3.8 \u00d7 10(-6)) and HLA-DP\u03b21 (Phe9, conditional P = 3.0 \u00d7 10(-5)) concordant with European populations. Our trans-ethnic HLA fine-mapping study reveals that (i) a common set of amino acid residues confer shared effects in European and Asian populations and (ii) these same effects can explain ethnically heterogeneous classical allelic associations (e.g. HLA-DRB1*09:01) due to allele frequency differences between populations.

This observation led us to hypothesize that two polymorphisms might influence the susceptibility of sporadic congenital heart disease (CHD). We conducted a case-control study comprised of 945 CHD cases and 972 non-CHD controls in a Chinese population. We tested our hypothesis by genotyping ECE1 C338A and T839G and assessed their association with the risk of CHD. Compared with the 338 CC and the 839 TT genotypes, the ECE1 338 AA/AC and 839 TG/GG genotypes significantly increased the risk of CHD (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.14-1.68; and adjusted OR=1.30, 95% CI=1.07-1.58, respectively). A combined analysis was performed that showed that the presence of 2-4 risk alleles (the ECE1 338A and 839G allele) increased the risk of CHD by 2.07-fold compared with 0-1 risk alleles.

GCKR is a rate-limiting factor of glucokinase (GCK), which functions as a key glycolytic enzyme for maintaining glucose homeostasis. We examined the associations of two common genetic polymorphisms of GCKR and GCK with metabolic traits in healthy Chinese adults and adolescents. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs780094 at GCKR and rs1799884 at GCK, were genotyped in 600 healthy adults and 986 healthy adolescents. The associations of these SNPs with metabolic traits were assessed by linear regression adjusted for age, sex, and/or BMI. We also tested for the epistasis between these two SNPs and performed a meta-analysis among European and Asian populations. The T-allele of GCKR rs780094 was associated with increased triglycerides (P = 5.4 x 10(-7)), while the A-allele of GCK rs1799884 was associated with higher FPG (P = 3.1 x 10(-7)). A novel interaction effect between the two SNPs on FPG was also observed (P = 0.0025). Meta-analyses strongly supported the additive effects of the two SNPs on FPG and triglycerides, respectively.

Although anterior decompression with trephination is a variant of the Cloward technique, little information is available concerning the long-term results after this procedure. One hundred sixty-eight consecutive patients treated with this technique by the same author from the years 1978 to 1992 were followed serially. One hundred and seven patients were followed for over 10 years (mean: 14.1 y) (follow-up rate: 71.8%). Clinical results were evaluated according to the Japanese Orthopedic Association system and the results at different postoperative intervals were analyzed. Thirty-six patients returned for the final follow-up. Plain radiographs were taken in neutral and flexion-extension positions and computed tomography scans were taken at fused segments and unfused levels. The mean recovery rate was 56.8% at final follow-up. Deterioration of 2 Japanese Orthopedic Association points or more was experienced in 44 patients at various postoperative periods and was more frequent at over 10 years follow-up. Kyphosis of fused segments was noted frequently on the radiographies of the 36 patients with a mean of 7.8 degrees. A straight or misaligned cervical spine was found in 28 (77.8%) patients and these deformities were more serious in multilevel fusions.

Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs800292, rs1061170, rs1410996, rs2274700) in the complement factor H (CFH) gene, 1 SNP (rs11200638) in the high-temperature requirement factor A1 (HTRA1) gene, 3 SNPs (rs699947, rs1570360, rs2010963) in the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene, and 4 SNPs (rs12150053, rs12948385, rs9913583, rs1136287) in the pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) gene were assessed using TaqMan technology. The clinical phenotype information and genotypes of CFH, HTRA1, VEGF, and PEDF polymorphisms. Of Japanese patients with neovascular AMD (nAMD), 219 (58.7%) had typical nAMD and 154 (41.3%) had polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). The frequency of bilateral exudative involvement was similar between typical nAMD (15.5%) and PCV (13.6%) (P = 0.613). Significant soft drusen were observed in the fellow eyes of 88 (47.6%) of 185 patients with unilateral typical nAMD and in 25 (18.8%) of 133 patients with unilateral PCV (P = 1.24x10(-7)). A serous pigment epithelium detachment was seen in 55 (25.1%) of 219 patients with typical nAMD and in 64 (41.6%) of 154 patients with PCV. A significant association was noted in CFH-rs800292, CFH-rs1410996, CFH-rs2274700, and HTRA1-rs11200638 with AMD development (P = 2.36x10(-5), 7.18x10(-5), 7.18x10(-5), 2.70x10(-7), respectively; population attributable risk = 57.3%, 57.8%, 57.8%, and 58.9%, respectively). We estimated the highest-risk group to have an approximately 70-fold greater risk of nAMD compared with the lowest-risk group when analyzing a combination of 4 SNPs in the CFH and HTRA1 genes. The Japanese AMD phenotype is characterized by a higher frequency of PCV, male predominance, and lower frequency of bilateral presentation compared with Caucasian AMD.

We screened for polymorphisms of SLC22A12 and conducted an association study between genetic polymorphisms and urate levels in an epidemiologic cohort representing the general population in Japan. Functional significance of mutations was assessed by oocyte expression analysis. We found five missense, one nonsense, and one deletion mutations [R90H, A226V, R228E, W258Stop, Q312L, D313A (deletion of 313D-333P), and R477H] in 24 subjects with hypouricemia recruited from an epidemiologic cohort (Suita Study) representing the general population in Japan (N= 1875). A statistical analysis indicated that the 90H (N= 14), 477H (N= 5), and 258Stop (hetero + homo N= 82 + 3) alleles were associated with hypouricemia. The alleles 228E and 313A (deletion of 313D-333P) were found just once in the total population. In vitro oocyte expression analysis indicated that 313A (deletion of 313D-333P) had no urate transport activity, indicating that this is a newly identified mutation for idiopathic renal hypouricemia. Intriguingly, the allele frequency of 258Stop was unexpectedly high (2.37%). However, this inactivating mutation does not seem to be harmful in the general population. The effects of common polymorphisms of SLC22A12 were also investigated. Based on linkage disequilibrium, 16 common polymorphisms were categorized into six distinct groups, and six representative genotypes were determined. None of these six common polymorphisms affected the serum uric acid level.

To identify any possible associations between GSTs polymorphisms and AD susceptibility, the prevalence of two specific polymorphisms -GSTM1 and GSTT1 (homozygous deletion vs. undeleted) - were quantified by multiplex PCR in 145 patients with AD and 267 healthy controls. In individuals with AD, GSTM1/GSTT1 polymorphisms were compared with family history of AD, age of disease onset, disease severity [per SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD)], serum IgE level and presence of other allergic diseases.

A total of 102 patients under warfarin anticoagulant therapy were selected. During follow-up, warfarin dosage and associated Prothrombin Time-International Normalized Ratio (P-INR) values were recorded. Simultaneous monitoring of incidence of bleeding and thrombosis adverse effect was recommended. Genetic polymorphisms of the above mentioned loci were identified by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. The average age of the 102 patients was (62.1+/-10.5) years. The body mass index (BMI) was (24.7+/-3.8) kg/m2. Mean daily warfarin requirement was from 1.250 to 5.077 mg/day when therapeutic PT-INR (1.5-2.5) was maintained.

{"abstract": "The prognostic relevance of inherited variations in hormone-related genes in the context of prostate cancer (PCa) progression has not been well studied. Of these, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) gene products lead to inactivation of steroids. Our objective was to determine whether polymorphisms in five UGT genes, involved in steroid metabolism, are associated with the risk of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP) and to examine their relationship with hormonal exposure. The study included 526 Caucasian and 320 Asian men who underwent RP for clinically localized PCa. The relationship between genotypes and biochemical recurrence were assessed with multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. Plasma steroids were measured using specific and sensitive mass spectrometry-based methods. The presence of at least two deleted copies of UGT2B17 and UGT2B28 genes resulted in a hazard ratio of 2.26 (95% confidence interval = 1.41-3.61; P = 0.0007) for Caucasians and 2.16 (95% confidence interval = 1.24-3.73; P = 0.006) for Asians. A positive association was observed only between UGT2B17 deletion and the Gleason score in Asians, whereas no other interaction was shown with prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, and TNM (tumor node metastasis) staging. Patients carrying UGT2B17 deletions and those with three deleted UGT2B copies had significantly lower androgen glucuronides, in support of an altered androgen metabolism. This study is the first to recognize the prognostic significance of common deletions in steroid inactivation pathways in localized PCa after RP. Alteration of circulating steroid levels associated with UGT2B gene deletions further support the notion that such inherited genomic deletions have the potential to modify hormonal exposure and risk of recurrence.", "title": "Deletions of the androgen-metabolizing UGT2B genes have an effect on circulating steroid levels and biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy in localized prostate cancer.", "pmid": "21733997", "id": "1552"},

The study was a part of the Korean cohort study. Two thousand four hundred sixty-two subjects aged 50 years and older who were derived from the cohort and who were assessed for OA at the knee were genotyped. The anteroposterior extended-view weight-bearing radiographs of the knees were obtained. Of the subjects, 725 subjects had radiographic OA. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Genotyping was performed using High Resolution Melt or the Taq-Man allelic discrimination assay and the Rotor-Gene 6000 (Corbett Research, Sydney,Australia). Associations were tested by calculating the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), using logistic regression analysis with adjustments for age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). The mean age of the OA patients (females: 554 subjects, 76.4%) was 67.4 (7.9) years. The intraobserver agreement was high for the identification of osteophytes (\u03ba: 0.80) and joint space narrowing (\u03ba: 0.70). There was no significant difference (all P values > 0.05) in the genotype or allele frequencies between the patients with OA and healthy controls.

A total of 603 participants (278 urban and 325 rural subjects) were recruited from Bali Island, Indonesia. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC) were measured. Obesity was determined based on WHO classifications for adult Asians. Participants were genotyped for G(-866)A and Ala55Val polymorphisms of the UCP2 gene. Obesity prevalence was higher in urban subjects (51%) as compared to rural subjects (23%). The genotype, minor allele (MAF), and heterozygosity frequencies were similar between urban and rural subjects for both SNPs. All genotype frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A combined analysis of genotypes and environment revealed that the urban subjects carrying the A/A genotype of the G(-866)A SNP have higher BMI than the rural subjects with the same genotype. Since the two SNPs showed strong linkage disequilibrium (D'\u2009=\u20090.946, r2\u2009=\u20090.657), a haplotype analysis was performed.

Given the established role of estrogens in breast cancer, we hypothesized that coding variation in steroid receptor coactivator and corepressor genes may alter inter-individual response to estrogen and serve as markers of breast cancer risk. We sequenced the coding exons of 17 genes (EP300, CCND1, NME1, NCOA1, NCOA2, NCOA3, SMARCA4, SMARCA2, CARM1, FOXA1, MPG, NCOR1, NCOR2, CALCOCO1, PRMT1, PPARBP and CREBBP) suggested to influence transcriptional activation by steroid hormone receptors in a multiethnic panel of women with advanced breast cancer (n = 95): African Americans, Latinos, Japanese, Native Hawaiians and European Americans. Association testing of validated coding variants was conducted in a breast cancer case-control study (1,612 invasive cases and 1,961 controls) nested in the Multiethnic Cohort. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios for allelic effects in ethnic-pooled analyses as well as in subgroups defined by disease stage and steroid hormone receptor status. We also investigated effect modification by established breast cancer risk factors that are associated with steroid hormone exposure. We identified 45 coding variants with frequencies > or = 1% in any one ethnic group (43 non-synonymous variants). We observed nominally significant positive associations with two coding variants in ethnic-pooled analyses (NCOR2: His52Arg, OR = 1.79; 95% CI, 1.05-3.05; CALCOCO1: Arg12His, OR = 2.29; 95% CI, 1.00-5.26). A small number of variants were associated with risk in disease subgroup analyses and we observed no strong evidence of effect modification by breast cancer risk factors. Based on the large number of statistical tests conducted in this study, the nominally significant associations that we observed may be due to chance, and will need to be confirmed in other studies. Our findings suggest that common coding variation in these candidate genes do not make a substantial contribution to breast cancer risk in the general population.

To identify the locus and allele within the HLA region associated with the nonresponsiveness to HBsAg, serological HLA typing, DNA typing of HLA-DQ and DP alleles using amplified HLA genes and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the fourth component of complement (C4) genes were performed in healthy unrelated Japanese vaccinees who were immunized subcutaneously three times with plasma-derived HBsAg vaccine. In nonresponders to HBsAg, the frequencies of HLA-Bw54 cross-reactive epitope group (CREG); (Bw54, Bw55, Bw56 and other Bw22), C4 RFLP (6.5 kb + 12.0 kb), DR4, DRw53 and DQw4 (DQA1*0301-DQB1*0401) were increased and the frequencies of HLA-DR1, DRw6 and DQw1 were decreased as compared with those in healthy unrelated controls. Further analysis revealed that the coexistence of HLA-Bw54CREG and DR4-DRw53-DQw4 (DQA1*0301-DQB1*0401) was associated with the nonresponder group, whereas, donors positive for exclusively either Bw54 CREG or DR4-DRw53-DQw4 (DQA1*0301-DQB1*0401) were not associated with the nonresponder group.

In this study, we examined the impact of FCGR2B c.695T>C on the functional properties of FcgammaRIIB by expressing each allele product in a human B cell line ST486 lacking endogenous FcgammaRIIB. FcgammaRIIB 232Thr was found to be significantly less potent than wild-type 232Ile in inhibiting B cell receptor (BCR)-mediated phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate accumulation, Akt and PLCgamma2 activation and calcium mobilization, and to display decreased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation and SH2-containing 5'-inositolphosphate phosphatase recruitment compared with 232Ile after IgG Fc-mediated coligation with BCR. Notably, a quantitative analysis of the subcellular distribution of FcgammaRIIB using 125I-labeled anti-FcgammaRIIB revealed that FcgammaRIIB 232Thr is less effectively distributed to detergent-insoluble lipid rafts than 232Ile, findings in accordance with the importance of the transmembrane amino acid residues, in particular large hydrophobic amino acids including Ile, in the association of membrane proteins with lipid rafts. Given the crucial roles of lipid rafts in integrating BCR signaling, decreased association of FcgammaRIIB 232Thr could contribute to its impaired inhibitory potential.

Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) plays a crucial role in regulating folate metabolism, which affects both DNA synthesis/repair and methylation. We examined if smoking or alcohol consumption modify associations between MTHFR polymorphisms and lung cancer risk. We evaluated the role of the MTHFR C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131) polymorphisms in a case-control study comprised of 462 lung cancer cases and 379 controls in a Japanese population. Logistic regression was used to assess the adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The TT genotype of the C677T polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (OR = 2.27, 95% CI = 1.42 - 3.62, P < 0.01) while the A1298C polymorphism was not associated with lung cancer risk. The minor alleles of both polymorphisms behaved in a recessive fashion. The highest risks were seen for 677TT-carriers with a history of smoking or excessive drinking (OR = 6.16, 95% CI = 3.48 - 10.9 for smoking; OR = 3.09, 95% CI = 1.64 - 5.81 for drinking) compared with C-carriers without a history of smoking or excessive drinking, but no interactions were seen. The 1298CC genotype was only associated with increased risk among non-smokers (P < 0.05), and smoking was only associated with increased risks among 1298A-carriers (P < 0.01), but no significant interaction was seen. There was a synergistic interaction between the A1298C polymorphism and drinking (P < 0.05). The highest risk was seen for the CC-carriers with excessive drinking (OR = 7.24, 95% CI = 1.89 - 27.7) compared with the A-carriers without excessive drinking). The C677T polymorphism was significantly associated with lung cancer risk. Although the A1298C polymorphism was not associated with lung cancer risk, a significant interaction with drinking was observed. Future studies incorporating data on folate intake may undoubtedly lead to a more thorough understanding of the role of the MTHFR polymorphisms in lung cancer development.", "title": "Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms and interaction with smoking and alcohol consumption in lung cancer risk: a case-control study in a Japanese population.", "pmid": "22024018", "id": "1568"},

New genetic loci associated with fat distribution, measured by waist-hip ratios and computed tomography (CT), have recently been identified by genome-wide association studies in European-descent populations. This study used CT to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that confer susceptibility to fat distribution are associated with visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) in the Japanese population. We measured the VFAs and SFAs of 1424 obese Japanese subjects (BMI\u226525 kg/m(2), 635 men and 789 women) that were genotyped at 15 SNPs, namely, TBX15 rs984222, DNM3 rs1011731, LYPLAL1 rs4846567, GRB14 rs10195252, NISCH rs6784615, ADAMTS9 rs6795735, CPEB4 rs6861681, LY86 rs1294421, VEGFA rs6905288, RSPO3 rs9491696, NFE2L3 rs1055144, ITPR2 rs718314, HOXC13 rs1443512, ZNRF3 rs4823006 and THNSL2 rs1659258. The G-allele of LYPLAL1 rs4846567 was borderline associated with an increased ratio of VFA to SFA (V/S ratio; p= 0.0020). LYPLAL1 rs4846567 had a stronger effect on the V/S ratio in women (p= 0.0078) than in men (p= 0.12); however, neither result was significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. NISCH rs6784615 was nominally associated with increased VFA (p=0.040) and V/S ratio (p= 0.020). The other SNPs analyzed were not significantly associated with body mass index (BMI), VFA, or SFA.

We found an association between an adult asthma and an SNP encoding TNC fibronectin type III-D (Fn-III-D) domain in a case-control study between a Japanese population including 446 adult asthmatic patients and 658 normal healthy controls. The SNP (44513A/T in exon 17) strongly associates with adult bronchial asthma (chi2 test, P=0.00019, Odds ratio=1.76, 95% confidence interval=1.31-2.36). This coding SNP induces an amino acid substitution (Leu1677Ile) within the Fn-III-D domain of the alternative splicing region. Computer-assisted protein structure modeling suggests that the substituted amino acid locates at the outer edge of the beta-sheet in Fn-III-D domain and causes instability of this beta-sheet. As the TNC fibronectin-III domain has molecular elasticity, the structural change may affect the integrity and stiffness of asthmatic airways. In addition, TNC expression in lung fibroblasts increases with Th2 immune cytokine stimulation. Thus, Leu1677Ile may be valuable marker for evaluating the risk for developing asthma and plays a role in its pathogenesis.", "title": "Coding SNP in tenascin-C Fn-III-D domain associates with adult asthma.", "pmid": "16115819", "id": "1575"},

We conducted an association study with replication in 4,478 SLE cases and 12,656 controls from six East Asian cohorts to identify new SLE susceptibility loci and better localize known loci. We identified ten new loci and confirmed 20 known loci with genome-wide significance. Among the new loci, the most significant locus was GTF2IRD1-GTF2I at 7q11.23 (rs73366469, Pmeta = 3.75 \u00d7 10(-117), odds ratio (OR) = 2.38), followed by DEF6, IL12B, TCF7, TERT, CD226, PCNXL3, RASGRP1, SYNGR1 and SIGLEC6. We identified the most likely functional variants at each locus by analyzing epigenetic marks and gene expression data. Ten candidate variants are known to alter gene expression in cis or in trans. Enrichment analysis highlights the importance of these loci in B cell and T cell biology. The new loci, together with previously known loci, increase the explained heritability of SLE to 24%. The new loci share functional and ontological characteristics with previously reported loci and are possible drug targets for SLE therapeutics.

To further explore our previous linkage signal in the AJ population (NPL score: 4.27, empirical p = 2 x 10(-5)), we performed a peakwide association fine mapping study by using 1414 SNPs across approximately 12.5 Mb in 10q22-q23. We genotyped 1515 AJ individuals, including 285 parent-child trios, 173 unrelated cases, and 487 unrelated controls. We analyzed the binary diagnostic phenotype of SZ and 9 heritable quantitative traits derived from a principal components factor analysis of 73 items from our consensus diagnostic ratings and direct assessment interviews. Although no marker withstood multiple test correction for association with the binary SZ phenotype, we found strong evidence of association by using the \"delusion\" factor as the quantitative trait at three SNPs (rs10883866, rs10748842, and rs6584400) located in a 13 kb interval in intron 1 of Neuregulin 3 (NRG3). Our best p value from family-based association analysis was 7.26 x 10(-7). We replicated this association in the collection of 173 unrelated AJ cases (p = 1.55 x 10(-2)), with a combined p value of 2.30 x 10(-7).

VZV is one of eight human herpesviruses that have existed for at least 400 million years. It has co-evolved with humankind and is present in all nationalities globally. The pathogenesis of varicella (chickenpox) is dependent on viral replication and dispersion through the body in T-lymphocytes. VZV replication is similar to that of herpes simplex virus. A complete analysis of VZV transcripts has identified their relative abundance, with transcripts for the regulatory proteins (open reading frame) ORF62 and ORF63 among the greatest. Studies of virion assembly have shown that endocytosis pathways are involved in the envelopment process by the viral glycoproteins. The complete sequencing of five VZV strains has identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms, and in turn, VZV strains have been segregated into European/North American and Asian clades. Furthermore, a small number of mutant VZV strains have been identified.

{"abstract": "Many anthropometric measures, including body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and subcutaneous fat thickness, are used as indicators of nutritional status, fertility and predictors of future health outcomes. While BMI is currently the best available estimate of body adiposity, WHR and skinfold thickness at various sites (biceps, triceps, suprailiac, and subscapular) are used as indices of body fat distribution. Copy number variation (CNV) is an attractive emerging approach to the study of associations with various diseases. In this study, we investigated the dosage effect of genes in the CNV genome widely associated with fat distribution phenotypes in large cohorts. We used the Affymetrix genome-wide human SNP Array 5.0 data of 8,842 healthy unrelated adults in KARE cohorts and identified CNVs associated with BMI and fat distribution-related traits including WHR and subcutaneous skinfold thickness at suprailiac (SUP) and subscapular (SUB) sites. CNV segmentation of each chromosome was performed using Golden Helix SVS 7.0, and single regression analysis was used to identify CNVs associated with each phenotype. We found one CNV for BMI, 287 for WHR, 2,157 for SUP, and 2,102 for SUB at the 5% significance level after Holm-Bonferroni correction. Genes included in the CNV were used for the analysis of functional annotations using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID v6.7b) tool. Functional gene classification analysis identified five significant gene clusters (metallothionein, ATP-binding proteins, ribosomal proteins, kinesin family members, and zinc finger proteins) for SUP, three (keratin-associated proteins, zinc finger proteins, keratins) for SUB, and one (protamines) for WHR. BMI was excluded from this analysis because the entire structure of no gene was identified in the CNV. Based on the analysis of genes enriched in the clusters, the fat distribution traits of KARE cohorts were related to the fat redistribution associated with the aging process. In addition to structural variation, dosage effect analysis of genes based on CNV is useful to gain an understanding of the comprehensive biological phenomena underlying particular phenotypes and/or diseases.", "title": "Genome-wide analysis of copy number variations reveals that aging processes influence body fat distribution in Korea Associated Resource (KARE) cohorts.", "pmid": "22825314", "id": "1595"},

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the common defects that causes ovary dysfunction and is linked to aberrant processes in folliculogenesis. Previous studies have discovered several mutations in the screening of GDF9 in premature ovarian failure but none in PCOS. This current study focused on the mutational analysis of the coding region of GDF9 among 216 Chinese PCOS patients. Of the 10 different variants found in this study, five novel missense mutations in GDF9 were discovered namely c.15C>G, c.118T>G, c.133A>G, c.1025A>T and c.1275C>A.

The aim of this study was to evaluate these associations. Familial and sporadic cases were investigated. Familial cases, consisting of 96 subjects with IA, and 46 subjects of unknown status from 31 pedigrees were analyzed with the transmission disequilibrium test and linkage analysis. Associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with IA were tested in 419 sporadic IA cases and in 408 control subjects. Sequencing of CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and CDKN2BAS revealed additional SNPs, and their associations with IA were also tested. The transmission disequilibrium test revealed associations of 2 SNPs, rs700651 (P=0.036) and rs1333040 (P=0.002), with familial IA. Analysis of SNPs in sporadic cases revealed an allelic association of rs1333040 with IA (odds ratio=1.28; 95% CI, 1.04-1.57; P=0.02) but failed to show associations of rs10757278 and rs496892 with IA.

The impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in folate-metabolizing enzymes has been investigated in risk of breast cancer among European or Asian populations, but not among women of African ancestry. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of SNPs in eleven genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and risk of breast cancer in 1,275 European-American (EA) and 1,299 African-American (AA) women who participated in the Women's Circle of Health Study. Allele frequencies varied significantly between EA and AA populations. A number of these SNPs, specifically in genes including MTR, MTRR, SHMT1, TYMS and SLC19A1, were associated with overall breast cancer risk, as well as risk by estrogen receptor (ER) status, in either EA or AA women. Associations appeared to be modified by dietary folate intake. Although single-SNP associations were not statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons, polygenetic score analyses revealed significant associations with breast cancer risk. Per unit increase of the risk score was associated with a modest 19 to 50% increase in risk of breast cancer overall, ER positive or ER negative cancer (all p\u2009<\u20090.0005) in EAs or AAs.

{"abstract": "Recently, large-scale meta-analyses of genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified a number of loci significantly associated with systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure (BP). Most of the GWA studies reported to date were conducted in populations of European descent. Given the appreciable ethnic differences in clinical presentation of hypertension, studies in non-European populations allow us to assess the relevance of the findings in Europeans to other ethnic groups and to potentially discover novel variants. Before the GWA scan era, the presence of racial or ethnic differences has been widely recognized for response to antihypertensive therapies, salt sensitivity and impact of obesity on developing hypertension. Despite a limited number of genetic loci that have been proven to show substantial ethnic differences, we can assume four possible genetic mechanisms--(1) absence of target variants in other ethnic groups; (2) presence of allelic heterogeneity; (3) difference in linkage disequilibrium structure; and (4) gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Considering such a number of potential sources of heterogeneity, we should be cautious about claiming the presence of genuine ethnic differences in genetic susceptibility to BP-related traits or hypertension. Approximately a quarter of BP-associated loci that have been reported in four meta-analyses of GWA studies (i.e., 8 out of 34 loci) appear to be common across three ethnic groups--Europeans, east Asians and south Asians.

Our previous study indicated that the combined effect of two intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are located in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 3B1 (ALDH3B1) genes, respectively, conferred genetic risk to paranoid schizophrenia. To further explore the precise mechanism of the COMT and ALDH3B1 interaction involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, we scanned all possible functional SNPs within these two genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based genotyping analysis in 540 paranoid schizophrenic patients and 660 control subjects from a Han Chinese population. We also determined the effects of schizophrenia-associated SNPs on the development of psychotic symptoms, P300 event-related potential components induced by an auditory odd-ball task, and gene expression examined by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The major findings of this study were that, among the individuals carrying the rs3751082 A allele in the ALDH3B1 gene, the rs4633 T allele in the COMT gene was associated with susceptibility to paranoid schizophrenia (p = .004), development of hallucination (p = 5.141 E-5), delay of P300 latency in both patients (p = .006) and control subjects (p = .02), and increased expression of the COMT gene in control subjects (p = .002).

Additional mandibular prognathism criteria included negative overjet and visually prognathic (concave) profile as determined by the subject's clinical evaluation. Orthognathic subjects without jaw deformations were used as the comparison group. The mandibular prognathic and orthognathic subjects were matched by race, sex, and age.

Phenotypes were then analyzed for associations with haplotypes. CYP2A6 transcript, protein and activity levels were correlated among each other. In 45 African-American, 156 Caucasian, 47 Chinese, 50 Japanese and 47 Korean DNA samples, we detected 95 different polymorphisms in the CYP2A6 gene, 49 of which had not been described previously. Caucasian variants formed 33 haplotypes which built four clades. Allele *9B and the CYP2A7/2A6 partial deletion allele CYP2A6*12B were both associated with decreased expression. The latter haplotype extends at least over 147 kb up into the CYP2B6 gene. A haplotype almost identical to allele *1A was associated with decreased expression and activity of CYP2A6 compared to all other haplotypes.

Our previous study suggested PPARg Pro12Ala polymorphism to represent a susceptibility factor for periodontitis in pregnant Japanese women. Several recent papers have drawn attention to a possible link between low bone mineral density (BMD) and periodontitis in postmenopausal women. Since the pathogenesis for both involve bone remodeling, they might share common risk factors such as gene polymorphisms and vitamin D level. The present study investigated possible associations between the PPARgPro12Ala polymorphism, periodontitis, BMD and serum 25(OH)D in postmenopausal Japanese women.

SARS was characterized by high infectivity, morbidity and mortality, and the confined pattern of the disease spreading among the countries of South-East and East Asia suggested the existence of susceptible factor(s) in these populations. Studies in the populations of Hong Kong and Taiwan showed an association of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms with the development and/or severity of SARS, respectively. The aim of the present study was to define the genotypic patterns of HLA-A, -B and -DRB1 loci in SARS patients and a co-resident population of Guangdong province, southern China, where the first SARS case was reported. The samples comprised 95 cases of recovered SARS patients and 403 unrelated healthy controls. HLA -A, -B and -DRB1 alleles were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers. The severity of the disease was assessed according to the history of lung infiltration, usage of assisted ventilation and occurrence of lymphocytopenia. Although the allelic frequencies of A23, A34, B60, DRB1*12 in the SARS group were slightly higher, and A33, -B58 and -B61 were lower than in the controls, no statistical significance was found when the Pc value was considered.

{"abstract": "The mtDNA genome has been implicated as playing a pivotal role in determining the longevity and success of the human lifespan. A PCR-RFLP methodology was used to identify polymorphic restriction enzyme sites within a 2643 bp region of the mtDNA genome and a table of genetic haplotypes for a healthy aged and a younger control cohort of patients was constructed. Forty-six different mtDNA haplotypes and 11 groups of related haplotypes were identified across the two age groups but statistical analysis failed to show any significant associations. The European J haplogroup, previously reported to be associated with longevity, was not found at an increased frequency within the Irish aged population (P=0.36). However, the haplotypes comprising the J haplogroup could be differentiated into two distinct branches by the presence or absence of the two polymorphic restriction sites, 16,389g and 16,000g. The branch of haplotypes defined by 16,389g displayed a significant increased frequency in the aged samples (8%) compared to the controls (1%), P=0.015. Inversely, the branch of haplotypes defined by 16,000g displayed a significant decreased frequency in the aged samples (4%) compared to the controls (13%), P=0.011. The polymorphism (mt5178A) associated with longevity in the Japanese was not found in the Irish population, while the polymorphism (mt9055A) associated with successful ageing in the French centenarians was found at an increased frequency in the Irish aged population (9%) compared to the younger control group (5%), but failed to reach a level of statistical significance, P=0.164.", "title": "Mitochondrial DNA polymorphism: its role in longevity of the Irish population.", "pmid": "11404057", "id": "1646"},

As a result, a total of 23 case-control studies including 4,028 cases and 4,872 controls were selected for analysis. Interestingly, the results showed that NAT2 polymorphisms might increase HNC risk for the overall data (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.01-1.49). Moreover, in subgroup analyses according to ethnicity, data showed that slow acetylators might increase HNC susceptibility among Asians (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.27-2.49), but not among Caucasians or mixed ethnicities.

The multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) C3435T and G2677T/A variations and UGT1A1*6 and *28 were examined by direct sequencing of DNA from peripheral whole blood samples. The associations between genetic polymorphisms and severe (grade 3-4) hyperbilirubinemia were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis including demographic and clinical variables. The median patient age was 39 years (interquartile range, 34-51 years), and 91% were men. At baseline, the median CD4 cell count was 261 cells/microL (interquartile range, 181-405 cells/microL).

The degrading enzyme PAF acetylhydrolase (PAFAH) represents a candidate for asthma and other atopic diseases. Two loss-of-function mutations of PAFAH are associated with severe asthma in Japanese individuals. Our aim was to look for further PAFAH variants in white populations, their possible association with atopic and asthmatic phenotypes, and their functional importance. We picked up three common variants in the PAFAH gene: Arg92His (exon 4), Ile198Thr (exon 7), and Ala379Val (exon 11). The known loss-of-function mutations were not seen. The variant allele Thr198 was found to be highly associated with total IgE concentrations in an atopic population (P=.009) and with \"atopic asthma\" in an asthmatic population (P=.008). The variant allele Val379 was found to be highly associated with \"specific sensitization\" in the atopic population (P=.002) and with \"asthma\" in the asthmatic population (P=.003). By use of recombinant PAFAH enzymes, the variant Val379 showed increased (14 microM) and Thr198 markedly increased (42 microM) KM values compared to the wild type (7 microM); furthermore, Vmax of Val379 was highly increased (132%). Thr198 and Val379 influence plasmatic PAFAH toward lower substrate affinities and therefore are very likely to prolong the activities of PAF.

Genetic association studies (GAS) investigating the associations between three common polymorphisms (PAT, Lys939Gln, and Ala499Val) of the XPC gene and HNC risk have produced contradictory and inconclusive results. The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the contributions of these polymorphisms to the risk of HNC. A literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases to indentify eligible studies. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to evaluate the strength of the associations under a fixed- or random-effect model according to heterogeneity test. Twelve case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis with a total of 3,078 HNC patients and 4,311 healthy controls. For XPC PAT, a significant overall association was found under all major genetic models. Stratified analyses further indicated significant associations in the Caucasian, population-based, non-PCR-RFLP, esophageal cancer and oral cancer subgroups. For XPC Lys939Gln, few significant results were found in either the overall analysis or stratified analyses. For XPC Ala499Val, the combined results revealed a significantly increased risk of HNC for carriers of the 499Val allele. This meta-analysis shows that the XPC PAT and Ala499Val polymorphisms may be associated with an increased risk of HNC, while XPC Lys939Gln may not be associated with HNC risk.

Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have been identified in the adiponectin (ADIPOQ) gene. Associations of ADIPOQ polymorphisms with diabetes and obesity have been described in Caucasians and Asians. The purpose of this study was to determine if genetic variants of ADIPOQ are associated with insulin resistance and CV risk in African Americans. Metabolic traits (lipids, glucose, insulin, and insulin sensitivity) and blood pressure were measured in 273 African Americans. DNA was examined by DNA sequence analysis and SNPs of candidate genes including ADIPOQ were studied. Statistica analyses were performed by regression of the quantitative trait phenotypes on the groups defined by the SNP genotypes, adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI).

Recently, the alanine/valine (A/V) gene polymorphism of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), one of the key enzymes that catalyzes the remethylation of homocysteine, was reported. The VV genotype is correlated with increased plasma homocyst(e)ine levels as a result of the reduced activity and increased thermolability of this enzyme. In this study, we examined the association between the V allele of the MTHFR gene and ischemic stroke in an elderly Japanese population. The diagnosis of cerebral infarction of all study patients was confirmed by CT of the brain. The MTHFR genotype was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction followed by HinfI digestion. In 256 stroke patients and 325 control subjects, the frequencies of the V allele were 0.45 and 0.32, respectively. The odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals adjusted for the other risk factors were, respectively, 1.51 (1.02 to 2.23) for the AV genotype and 3.35 (1.94 to 5.77) for the VV genotype compared with the AA genotype. Both of these effects were statistically significant (P=0.041 and P<0.001, respectively). In patients with multiple infarcts in particular, the allele frequency of the V mutation was 0.56, and the association between the V allele and stroke was highly significant. Plasma homocyst(e)ine levels were significantly higher in patients with the VV genotype than in patients with the AA or AV genotype, especially those with low plasma folate levels. The V allele of the MTHFR gene was significantly associated with cerebral infarction in an elderly Japanese population in a codominant manner.

Here we performed a genome-wide association study meta-analysis in a total of >100,000 subjects of European and Asian ancestries (29,880 RA cases and 73,758 controls), by evaluating \u223c10 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We discovered 42 novel RA risk loci at a genome-wide level of significance, bringing the total to 101 (refs 2 - 4). We devised an in silico pipeline using established bioinformatics methods based on functional annotation, cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci and pathway analyses--as well as novel methods based on genetic overlap with human primary immunodeficiency, haematological cancer somatic mutations and knockout mouse phenotypes--to identify 98 biological candidate genes at these 101 risk loci. We demonstrate that these genes are the targets of approved therapies for RA, and further suggest that drugs approved for other indications may be repurposed for the treatment of RA. Together, this comprehensive genetic study sheds light on fundamental genes, pathways and cell types that contribute to RA pathogenesis, and provides empirical evidence that the genetics of RA can provide important information for drug discovery.", "title": "Genetics of rheumatoid arthritis contributes to biology and drug discovery.", "pmid": "24390342", "id": "1665"},

A case-control study was conducted between 162 CHD cases and 119 non-CHD controls to explore their contribution to CHD. For rs3184504 of SH2B3 gene, the meta-analysis was performed among 19 study stages among 94,555 participants. Significant association between rs3184504 and CHD risk was observed in European and South Asian populations (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.10-1.16, p < 0.0001, fixed-effect method). For the other SNPs (rs12619285, rs1420101, and rs4143832), we combined our case-control data with the previous studies and found no association of them with the risk of CHD. No significant contribution of the four genetic variants to CHD was observed in Han Chinese (p > 0.05).

In this study, we aimed to explore both main effects of single-locus and multi-locus interactions to test the hypothesis that the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) and perilipin (PLIN) genes may contribute to the etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) independently and/or through complex interactions in a Taiwanese population. There were 416 patients with a diagnosis of T2D and 188 age- and sex-similar control subjects. To investigate gene-gene interactions, we used both the generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction method and logistic regression models. Allelic and genotypic analyses showed significant main effects of ENPP1 rs1044498 (P = 0.000005 and 0.00007, respectively) on the risk of T2D after Bonferroni correction (P < 0.05/2 = 0.025). Compared to the carrier of the AA genotype of the ENPP1 rs1044498 polymorphism, the likelihood of T2D was 2.442 (95% confidence interval, 1.592-3.747) for the carrier of combined AC+CC genotypes after adjustment of sex and body mass index. In addition, the carriers of AA variant in the PLIN rs894160 polymorphism had a higher risk to T2D than those with the combined AG+GG variants (adjusted odds ratio, 1.856; 95% confidence interval, 1.106-3.115) after adjustment of sex and body mass index. Furthermore, the significant 2-locus (P = 0.001) generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction model was identified between ENPP1 and PLIN.

We did not identify any significant differences in genotypes of cases and matched controls; no mutations or non-synonymous polymorphisms were detected in these individuals.

To determine whether genetic variations in this locus are associated with schizophrenia in the Korean population, we investigated multiplex families and unrelated patients using linkage and association analyses. Seven microsatellite markers in 8p21-12 were genotyped for 40 families with schizophrenia, and a non-parametric linkage analysis was applied. The association study was performed with 242 unrelated schizophrenia patients and the same number of normal controls for three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), two microsatellite markers and their haplotypes. A significant linkage signal was observed on D8S1769, which is located 352 kb upstream of the 5' end of the first exon of NRG1 for two (\"narrow\" and \"narrow with auditory hallucination (AH)\") of the three adopted phenotype classes. In the association study, the G allele of SNP8NRG241930 was significantly in excess in the subgroup of patients with AHs.

Subjects included 32 Japanese patients, previously diagnosed with NMS, and 132 schizophrenic patients treated with neuroleptics without occurrence of NMS.

A large population case-control study in the Southern Chinese was performed to study genetic risk factors to DDD. To gain a better understanding of the etiology of DDD in relation to structural defects of the intervertebral disc. A Finnish study found an association between LBP and sciatica with two variants of the alpha-chains of collagen IX, encoded by the Trp2 and Trp3 alleles, representing Gln326Trp and Arg103Trp amino acid substitutions in the COL9A2 and COL9A3 genes, respectively. Trp2 was found only in affected individuals (4%), whereas Trp3 was present in both affected (24%) and unaffected (9%) individuals. Because of the low frequency of the Trp2 allele in whites, the significance and contribution of this allele to DDD are not known. Using more objective criteria to define the disease by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we tested these alleles for association with DDD in a large population study. Lumbar DDD, the presence of anular tears, and disc and endplate herniations were defined by MRI in 804 Southern Chinese volunteers 18 to 55 years of age. These were correlated with the frequencies of the Trp2 and Trp3 alleles.

Of 40 aging-related phenotypes, no significant association with genotype was seen. Thus common genetic variation (minor allele frequency \u226510%) in MTOR, RPTOR, RICTOR, and RPS6KA1 is not associated with extreme old age or aging phenotypes in this population. Further research is needed to assess the potential genetic contribution of other mTOR pathway genes to human longevity, gene expression, upstream and downstream targets, and clinically relevant aging phenotypes.

A total of 68 individuals with CRC and 112 non-cancer controls were divided into non-smoker and smoker groups according to pack-years of smoking. Genetic polymorphisms of UGT1A6 and UGT1A7 were examined using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).

{"abstract": "The autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH) gene is located on chromosome 1p35 and encodes a 308-amino acid protein containing a phosphotyrosine-binding domain. Several researchers have identified mutations of ARH that cause autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia; however, it remains unknown whether this gene is involved in common hypercholesterolemia. We searched for polymorphisms of the ARH gene by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing. We identified 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms of the gene, including 9 novel polymorphisms, and determined 2 haplotype blocks. No association was observed between common hypercholesterolemia and any polymorphisms or haplotypes of the ARH gene; however, we newly identified a rare Thr56Met missense mutation located in the phosphotyrosine-binding domain, which is the functional domain responsible for cholesterol metabolism. Among 1,800 Japanese individuals enrolled in the Suita study, only 4 were heterozygous for Thr56Met and all had hypercholesterolemia. The total cholesterol level and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of diabetic patients with the Thr56Met missense mutation was 276.3+/-13.8 mg/dL and 185.3+/-7.37 mg/dL, respectively.

However, a functional significance of the +49 A/G polymorphism is unknown, because it is believed the polymorphism does not affect the function of the CTLA-4 molecule. In this study, we examined the +49 A/G polymorphism of the CTLA-4 gene in 30 Japanese type 1 diabetic patients (14 type 1B and 16 type 1A) and 40 non-diabetic subjects in a case-control study, and stratified patients according to genotype of the polymorphism. The distribution of genotype frequencies differed between type 1 diabetic patients and controls (p<0.01). When the subjects were subdivided into type 1A and type 1B subgroups, a significant difference in G allele frequency was found only between type 1B patients and controls, whereas G allele frequency tended to be higher in type 1A diabetic patients than controls. Type 1B patients displayed more severe metabolic decompensation (higher plasma glucose concentration, lower urinary C-peptide levels, higher insulin requirement, and higher serum amylase levels), and were found to be more prone to diabetic ketoacidosis than type 1A patients. After stratification by genotype, differences in urinary C-peptide and serum amylase levels between type 1A and type 1B patients were found to be due to differences in the GG genotype subgroup, whereas in the AG subgroup those differences disappeared.

However, recent reports suggest that the p.E66Q variant is not a disease-causing mutation but is a risk factor for cerebral small-vessel occlusion. To evaluate the role of the p.E66Q in the progression of renal diseases, we performed a genetic association study in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this study, we enrolled 1651 chronic hemodialysis and 941 non-dialysis patients who attended medical institutions in the Niigata Prefecture, Japan. The frequency of the p.E66Q allele was compared between hemodialysis and non-dialysis patients, with data from a previously published study of Japanese male newborns. In addition, we compared estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) in the presence or absence of the p.E66Q variant in non-dialysis patients. Of the 2233 alleles in hemodialysis and 1447 alleles in non-dialysis patients, 21 and nine harbored p.E66Q, respectively. However, p.E66Q allele frequencies did not differ between the two patient groups (0.90 versus 0.62 %, P = 0.35), and no significant difference in p.E66Q allele frequency was observed between male hemodialysis patients and the general Japanese population (0.52 versus 0.63 %, P = 0.67).

Genotyping for the MMP-1 -1607 2G/1G, MMP-3 -1171 5A/6A, and MMP-9 -1562 C/T SNPs were performed by PCR-RFLP methods among 236 adult astrocytoma patients and 366 healthy controls. The results showed that the overall distribution of the MMP-1 allelotype and genotype among astrocytoma patients and healthy controls was significantly different (P = 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively). Compared with the 2G/2G genotype, the 1G/1G genotype significantly decreased the risk of astrocytoma development (adjusted OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.42-0.79). The similar results were obtained when stratified by gender and age at tumor diagnosis (< or =45 or >45 years). The association between MMP-3 -1171 5A/6A or MMP-9 -1562 C/T SNPs and susceptibility to astrocytoma was not observed in this study.

A case-control study involving 466 patients with hypospadias and 402 healthy subjects was conducted to assess the relationship between DGKK single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and hypospadias risk in the Han Chinese population. The 466 hypospadias patients were further divided into mild, moderate and severe subgroups for analysis. Six SNPs (rs1934179, rs4143304, rs9969978, rs1934188, rs4826632 and rs4599945) were marginally associated with mild and moderate hypospadias [odds ratios (ORs) > 1, P = 0.05 to P < 0.1), whereas no significant relationship was seen with the severe cases (ORs >1, P > 0.1). After correcting for multiple testing, it was determined that neither individual SNPs nor individual haplotypes were associated with hypospadias. To evaluate this relationship in multiple populations, we performed a meta-analysis on six SNPs, using combined data from our present results and those of previous studies of different races (including 1966 patients and 2492 controls).

The present study was designed to explore reliable predictors of OXCPN and thereby improve the management of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). We retrospectively investigated pharmacogenomic characteristics of OXCPN in 70 Japanese patients with CRC who received oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and updated the results of our previous analysis of ERCC1 (C118T, rs11615 and C8092A, rs3212986) and GSTP1 (Ile105Val, rs1695) polymorphisms. Univariate analysis suggested potential associations of severe OXCPN with rs843748 in ACYP2 and rs17140129 in FARS2, as well as with the absence of diabetes mellitus (DM) (p = 0.056, 0.072, and 0.029, respectively). There was no association between severe OXCPN and any of the 7 other SNPs. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that an increased risk of severe OXCPN was related to rs17140129 and the absence of DM (p = 0.034 and 0.030, respectively). On updated analysis, polymorphisms of ERCC1 (C118T, rs11615) and rs10486003 in TAC1 were associated with time to the onset of Grade 1 OXCPN (p = 0.024 and 0.049, respectively). Severe OXCPN is significantly related to rs17140129, found in the GWAS of Korean patients, in Japanese patients. Patients without DM are more likely to have OXCPN.

{"abstract": "To evaluate the impact of alcohol dehydrogenase-2 (ADH2) and aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) polymorphisms on esophageal cancer susceptibility in Southeast Chinese males. Two hundred and twenty-one esophageal cancer patients and 191 healthy controls from Taixing city in Jiangsu Province were enrolled in this study. ADH2 and ALDH2 genotypes were examined by polymerase chain reaction and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The ADH G allele carriers were more susceptible to esophageal cancer, but no association was found between ADH2 genotypes and risk of esophageal cancer when disregarding alcohol drinking status. Regardless of ADH2 genotype, ALDH2G/A or A/A carriers had significantly increased risk of developing esophageal cancer, with homozygous individuals showing higher esophageal cancer risk than those who were heterozygous. A significant interaction between ALDH2 and drinking was detected regarding esophageal cancer risk; the OR was 3.05 (95% CI: 1.49-6.25). Compared with non-drinkers carrying both ALDH2 G/G and ADH2 A/A, drinkers carrying both ALDH2 A allele and ADH2 G allele showed a significantly higher risk of developing esophageal cancer (OR = 8.36, 95% CI: 2.98-23.46). Both ADH2 G allele and ALDH2 A allele significantly increase the risk of esophageal cancer development in Southeast Chinese males.

Updated meta-analyses examining the association between MDM2 T309G polymorphism and lung cancer risk were performed. Separate analyses on ethnicity, smoking status, histological types and gender as well as source of controls were also implemented. Eligible studies were identified for the period up to Feb 2012.

The influence of genetics on surgery-induced hyperglycemia remains only partially understood. The study participants were Japanese patients treated for thoracic esophageal cancer with curative esophagectomy at Akita University Hospital between 2003 and 2007. We determined the associations between esophagectomy-induced stress hyperglycemia (> or =30 mg/dl increases in blood glucose during surgery) and genetic polymorphisms for C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, -beta, interferon-gamma, transforming growth factor-beta1, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-6 receptors, IL-10, IL-12beta, adiponectin, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma. In 28 (46%) patients, blood glucose levels increased more than 30 mg/dl during surgery. Among the genetic polymorphisms tested, CRP -717C>T was significantly associated with stress hyperglycemia during esophagectomy. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that patients with the CRP -717T/T genotype had a significantly greater risk of developing surgery-induced hyperglycemia than those with the CRP -717C/T genotype. Stress hyperglycemia was also significantly associated with postoperative infectious complications and duration of intensive care unit stay.

Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects cardiac autonomic regulation and has been used to evaluate dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system in hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. We examined the association between polymorphisms in the UCP2 and UCP3 genes and HRV in healthy young Japanese men. The 45 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism in exon8 of UCP2 and the -55C/T polymorphism in the UCP3 promoter region were genotyped (n = 255). Cardiac autonomic function was evaluated by power spectral analysis of HRV during supine rest and in a standing position. Low-frequency (0.15 Hz) components of HRV were quantified by frequency domain analysis. The I/I genotype of the UCP2 45 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism was associated with relatively higher blood pressure and HRV sympathetic indices (low frequency percentage and low frequency:high frequency ratio) at supine rest. For the -55C/T polymorphism of UCP3, individuals carrying the -55T allele had significantly lower HRV sympathetic indices, but higher HRV parasympathetic indices (high frequency and high frequency percentage), than carriers of the C/C genotype at standing. Both UCP2 and UCP3 polymorphisms were significantly associated with a third-degree family history of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Additionally, carriers of the UCP2 45 bp I allele -UCP3 -55C/C combined genotype had the lowest HRV sympathetic and the highest HRV parasympathetic indices at standing among the combined genotypes.

{"abstract": "COPD is a complex polygenic disease in which gene-environment interactions are very important. The gene encoding microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX1) is one of several candidate loci for COPD pathogenesis and is highly polymorphic. Based chi on the polymorphisms of EPHX1 gene (tyrosine/histidine 113, histidine/arginine 139), the population can be classified into four groups of putative EPHX1 phenotypes (fast, normal, slow and very slow). A number of studies have investigated the association between the genotypes and phenotypes of EPHX1 and COPD susceptibility in different populations, with inconsistent results. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the published data was performed to gain a clearer understanding of this association. The MEDLINE database was searched for case-control studies published from 1966 to August 2007. Data were extracted and pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Sixteen eligible studies, comprising 1847 patients with COPD and 2455 controls, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled result showed that the EPHX1 113 mutant homozygote was significantly associated with an increased risk of COPD (OR 1.59, 95% CI: 1.14-2.21). Subgroup analysis supported the result in the Asian population, but not in the Caucasian population. When the analysis was limited to only the larger-sample-size studies, studies in which controls were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and studies in which controls were smokers/ex-smokers, the pooled results supported the conclusion. The EPHX1 139 heterozygote protected against the development of COPD in the Asian population, but not in the Caucasian population. The other gene types of EPHX1 113 and EPHX1 139 were not associated with an increased risk of COPD. The slow activity phenotype of EPHX1 was associated with an increased risk of COPD. The fast activity phenotype of EPHX1 was a protective factor for developing COPD in the Asian population, but not in the Caucasian population. However, the very slow activity phenotype of EPHX1 was a risk for developing COPD in the Caucasian population, but not in the Asian population.

We screened single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the GSTP1 locus and performed an association study in the Japanese population using two independent case-control groups (group 1: 391 pediatric patients with asthma, 462 adult patients with asthma, and 639 controls, and group 2: 115 pediatric patients with asthma and 184 controls). The effect of GSTM1 null/present genotype on the association between GSTP1 Ile105Val and asthma was also investigated. We identified 20 SNPs at this locus and found this region consisted of one linkage disequilibrium block represented by four SNPs (tag SNPs). The association between the Ile105Val polymorphism in the GSTP1 gene and childhood asthma was significant in both groups (p = 0.047 in group 1, and p = 0.021 in group 2). This association was only significant in patients with GSTM1-positive genotype in both groups (group 1: GSTM1 present p = 0.013 and GSTM1 null p = 0.925, and group 2: GSTM1 present p = 0.015 and GSTM1 null p = 0.362). These findings suggest that the GSTP1 gene is a childhood asthma susceptible gene, and the GSTM1 gene is a modifier gene of GSTP1 for the risk of childhood asthma in the Japanese population.", "title": "The GSTP1 gene is a susceptibility gene for childhood asthma and the GSTM1 gene is a modifier of the GSTP1 gene.", "pmid": "17643058", "id": "1738"},

As the evidence has showed that Toll-like receptors (TLRs), I-IFN and IFN-inducible genes contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the aim of the current study was to investigate the possible associations between the VISA gene and SLE. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs17857295, rs2326369, rs7262903, and rs7269320, in VISA gene were genotyped in 123 SLE patients and 95 healthy controls. Genotyping was performed using direct sequencing the purified PCR products. Associations were analyzed by using the chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. Haplotype analysis was performed using haploview and PHASE2.1. None of the four SNPs was found to be associated with SLE. The four-SNPs haplotype analysis showed different effect between cases and controls. While the SNPs, rs17857295 and rs2326369, were found to be associated with the renal nephritis and arthritis of SLE patient, respectively.

By univariate analysis, old age, higher body mass index, waist-hip ratio and sum of four skinfolds were found to be significantly associated with hyperlipidemia. The frequencies of X- and E+ alleles of the apolipoprotein-B gene were significantly higher in North Indians in the state of New Delhi (0.83 and 0.91, respectively) as compared to the observations made in Caucasians in previous studies, but was similar to the frequency reported in Indians settled in Singapore and the UK. There were no significant differences in the allele or genotype frequencies of either Xba1 or EcoR1 polymorphisms between the hyperlipidemic and normolipidemic groups. On multiple logistic regression analysis considering body mass index, waist-hip ratio, percentage body fat and genotypes as independent variables, no association was observed between the apolipoprotein-B genotypes and serum lipid components. Further, there were no associations between apolipoprotein-B polymorphisms and generalized obesity (as assessed by body mass index, sum of four skinfolds, and percentage total body fat) and abdominal obesity (as measured by waist circumference and waist-hip ratio).

Polymorphic deletions of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes involved in the detoxification of potentially carcinogenic agents may be a risk factor for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. To investigate the roles of genetic variations of GSTM1 and GSTT1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma susceptibility in the Chinese population, we conducted a case-control study of 350 nasopharyngeal carcinoma cases and 622 controls. GSTM1 and GSTT1 deletion variants were genotyped by multiplex PCR assays. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). No significant association was observed for either GSTM1- or GSTT1-null genotype independently in the contribution to nasopharyngeal carcinoma risk. To explore possible joint effects of the GSTM1- and GSTT1-null polymorphisms with each other and with other risk factors for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, we examined the association between each combined genotype and the risk for nasopharyngeal carcinoma stratified by gender and EBV replication status. We found that individuals who carried GSTM1/GSTT1-double null genotype had a higher risk for nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the male population (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.97; P = 0.03); however, this was not significant after correction for multiple comparisons. No statistical difference was found between cases and controls in females and the subpopulation positive for immunoglobulin A antibodies to EBV capsid antigen for combined genotypes.

A total of 554 men from the Korean Cancer Prevention Study-II were used as a discovery stage and 1575 men collected by the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study were used as a replication stage. Analysis by Genome-wide Human single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array 5.0 was performed by using DNAs derived from venous blood.

We detected 12 genome-wide significant signals on chromosome 1q32.1, 10q11.2, and 19q13.41 between PSA levels and SNPs. The top SNP associated with log PSA levels was rs2153904 in SLC45A3 (p values, 5.24\u00d710(-9) to 2.00\u00d710(-6)).

{"abstract": "A high prevalence of nasal lymphoma expressing a T- or natural killer (NK)-cell phenotype (NTCL) with frequent association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been indicated in Asians. To characterize NTCL among the Japanese, the clinicopathologic features of 32 cases were evaluated and the cases were also analyzed for EBV-RNA using an ISH method. Morphologically, 31 cases were identified by atypical pleomorphic lymphoid infiltrates with polymorphous, angicentric, and necrotic features. Their lymphoma cells ranged in size from small to large and were mixed in varying proportion from case to case. The other one case showed a monomorphic 'blastic' appearance. EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) was detected in the neoplastic cells of 27 of the 32 cases examined. In the five EBV-negative cases, one was the 'blastic' type. Clonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangement was detected in none of seven cases examined. The patients had a median follow-up of 9 months (range, 1 month to 14 years and 11 months). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival was 49% at 5 years, correlating with clinical stage. These data support the concept that most cases of NTCL are identified as tumors with T/NK-cell characteristics and EBV association, distinctly different from other peripheral T-cell lymphomas. Furthermore, the one case of an EBV-negative 'blastic' variant appears not to fit well into the pleomorphic category but more closely resembles the pathologic features of extranasal angiocentric lymphoma with lymphoblastoid appearance. This study also showed no clear difference in clinical aspects other than the original site or in prognosis, between NTCL and extranasal angiocentric lymphomas despite the higher incidence of EBV association and the tendency for that peculiar anatomical site to be restricted to the former group.", "title": "Clinicopathologic study of nasal T/NK-cell lymphoma among the Japanese.", "pmid": "9051691", "id": "1744"},

In this study, we investigated the association of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) gene polymorphisms and urinary 1-OHP. One hundred forty-seven workers exposed to PAH and 69 nonexposure workers were recruited. Seven tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms in AhR gene were selected by pariwise r(2) method and minor allele frequency cutoff of 0.05 from Chinese genotype data in HapMap project. These seven tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped by PCR-based methods. Multivariate analysis of covariance revealed that the levels of 1-OHP in PAH-exposed workers carrying genotype CT were lower than workers carrying wild genotype TT at loci rs10250822 and rs2282885 of AhR gene (P = 0.032 and 0.044, respectively).

We investigated the CYP11B2 C-344T genotype in 802 subjects, aged 40 and over, in a Japanese community, who gave written informed consent and were monitored for 24 h ambulatory BP. The frequencies of the CC, CT, and TT genotypes in these Japanese subjects were 0.14, 0.44, and 0.42, showing a higher frequency of the T allele (0.64) than in Caucasians. Although there was no significant difference in 24 h ambulatory BP levels among the genotypes, the nocturnal decline in BP was significantly greater in the CC homozygous subjects than in other subjects (P = 0.0065 for systolic and P = 0.031 for diastolic decline in nocturnal BP). Detailed analyses demonstrated that this association was significant only in aged (60 years and over) or male subjects. The prevalence of previous cardiovascular disease was significantly less in these subjects with the CC genotype than in those with the TC and TT genotypes, although age, body mass index, male gender, smoking, use of alcohol and antihypertensive medication did not differ among the three genotypes. There was no significant difference among the three genotypes in biochemical and hormonal parameters. Although the C-344 T polymorphism of CYP11B2 did not directly influence the level of 24 h BP, the CC genotype was associated with decreased nocturnal BP in elderly or male Japanese.

{"abstract": "Many unknown genetic factors are involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Recently, the reverse genetic approach revealed that some genetic variants, such as angiotensinogen, lipoprotein lipase, and alpha-adducin gene polymorphisms, increase the risk for hypertension. Both in rat and human, the genetic predisposition to hypertension was confirmed only for angiotensinogen and alpha-adducin genes. Adducin is a membrane cytoskeletal protein, which is thought to regulate sodium transport. Abnormalities of membrane sodium transport in the kidney play an important role in hypertension. A recent report by Cusi et al showed that the Trp allele of alpha-adducin polymorphism (Gly 460 Trp) is associated with an increased risk of hypertension in whites, which led us to carry out a case-control study to examine whether the same association is observed in the Japanese population. We recruited 170 hypertensive and 194 normotensive Japanese subjects and compared the genotype distribution of alpha-adducin 460 polymorphism between cases and controls and between whites and Japanese. Trp allele frequency of controls in the Japanese subjects was twice as high as in the whites. However, no association was observed between alpha-adducin polymorphism and hypertension. Furthermore, alpha-adducin 460 polymorphism was not associated with any clinical characteristics.

In healthy, population-based Honduran controls, IL-1beta-511T+ prevalence was 81% (95% confidence interval, 75%-87%; CT, 57%; TT, 25%), which was among the highest reported.

Importantly, the CPI association with country incidence is highly significant (P = .0057), based on 16 global populations and Honduras. Sensitivity analysis confirms a robust CPI. The CPI, based on IL-1beta genotypes, has a strong association with country-specific gastric cancer incidence.

GSTT1 genotype significantly modified the association between exposure to Br-THMs (sum of BDCM, DBCM and TBM) and below-reference sperm motility (Pint=0.02). Men with above-median blood Br-THM levels had an increased odds ratio (OR) of below-reference sperm compared to men with below-median blood Br-THM levels (OR=2.15, 95% CI: 1.11, 4.19) in the GSTT1 null genotype only. In addition, we found that men with a TT of CYP2E1 rs 915,906 had higher blood TCM and TTHM (sum of TCM, BDCM, DBCM and TBM) concentrations than men with a CT/CC of CYP2E1 rs 915,906. Our results suggest that GSTT1 polymorphisms modify Br-THM exposure relation with semen quality, and CYP2E1 polymorphisms are associated with internal levels of exposure to THMs.", "title": "Interactions between CYP2E1, GSTZ1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms and exposure to drinking water trihalomethanes and their association with semen quality.", "pmid": "26970898", "id": "1774"},
{"abstract": "Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 metabolizes many promutagens and procarcinogens to biologically active metabolites, which strongly promote proliferation of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The CYP2C19 gene exhibits several genetic polymorphisms that are thought to play a major role in inter-individual variability in drug response, drug-xenobiotic interactions, and in cancer susceptibility. Two polymorphisms of the CYP2C19 gene (CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3) which was associated with reduced enzyme activity have been investigated extensively digestive tract cancer; however, these studies have yielded contradictory results. To clarify this inconsistency, we performed this meta-analysis including 15 case-control studies with a total of 3,252 cases and 6,269 controls. Overall, we found significant association between CYP2C19*2 and digestive tract cancer (OR = 1.27, 95 % CI, 1.07-1.51, P = 0.007) while no significant results were found for CYP2C19*3. Potential sources of heterogeneity including cancer types, ethnicity, source of control, and sample size of study were assessed. In the subgroup analyses by cancer types, significant association was detected only in esophagus cancer for CYP2C19*2. When stratified by ethnicity, significantly increased risks were found for the CYP2C19*2 polymorphism among Asians. This meta-analysis demonstrated that the CYP2C19*2 polymorphism is a risk factor for developing digestive tract cancer.

COX-2 plays an important role in carcinogenesis, and overexpression may increase proliferation, inhibit apoptosis, and enhance the invasiveness of breast cancer cells. Polymorphisms in the regulatory regions of the COX-2 gene may influence function and/or expression and contribute to interindividual variability in susceptibility to cancer. In this study three variants (-1195G/A and -765G/C in the promoter and 8473C/T in 3'UTR) of COX-2 were examined for correlation with breast cancer risk. A case-control study of 615 histologically confirmed breast cancer patients and 643 cancer-free controls frequency-matched for age were selected. Logistic regression analyses revealed that no overall significant associations were detected in the single-locus analysis between three polymorphisms of COX-2 and the risk of breast cancer. However, a significantly increased risk of breast cancer was associated with the combined genotypes containing \"more than 3 variant alleles\"' (adjusted OR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.01-1.84) compared with the combined genotypes with \"0-3 variant alleles.\" Haplotype analyses showed that haplotypes A-1195G-765T8473 and A-1195C-765T8473 were significantly associated with breast cancer risk (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.01-1.43 for A-1195G-765T8473; OR = 9.16, 95% CI 1.14-73.51 for A-1195C-765T8473) compared with the most common haplotype, G-1195G-765T8473.

The GNB3 C825T polymorphism may therefore be associated with many atherosclerosis-related phenotypes. On these grounds, we studied the C825T polymorphism in relation to atherosclerosis-related phenotypes in a large Japanese population. Analyses in general linear models showed that T carriers had a significantly wider pulse pressure (P=0.0089) as well as a significantly higher systolic blood pressure (P=0.026). In contrast, analyses in logistic regression models showed that the C825T polymorphism was not significantly associated with each of the four major classical risk factors for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and diabetes mellitus). However, a significantly higher percentage of subjects had none of the four disorders in CC homozygotes than in T carriers (P=0.026). Thus, the C825T polymorphism was significantly associated with clustering of these four risk factors.

Utilizing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the EPHX1 gene encoding mEH, we identified the haplotypes of EPHX1 blocks and investigated the association between the block haplotypes and CBZ-epoxide metabolism. SNPs of EPHX1 were analyzed by means of polymerase chain reaction amplification and DNA sequencing using DNA extracted from the blood leukocytes of 96 Japanese epileptic patients, including 58 carbamazepine-administered patients. The plasma concentrations of CBZ and its four metabolites were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. From sequencing all 9 exons and their surrounding introns, 29 SNPs were found in EPHX1. The SNPs were separated into three blocks on the basis of linkage disequilibrium, and the block haplotype combinations (diplotypes) were assigned. Using plasma CBZ-diol/CBZ-epoxide ratios (diol/epoxide ratios) indicative of the mEH activity, the effects of the diplotypes in each EPHX1 block were analyzed on CBZ-epoxide metabolism. In block 2, the diol/epoxide ratios increased significantly depending on the number of haplotype *2 bearing Y113H (P=0.0241).

In the first study, normotensive myocardial infarction patients (n = 103) and control subjects (n = 103), who were matched for established risk factors with the myocardial infarction patients, were randomly selected. The angiotensinogen-TT genotype (T indicates threonine instead of methionine at position 235) was more frequent in the myocardial infarction group than in the control group (P < .05). The ACE-DD genotype (D indicates a deletion polymorphism in intron 16) was also more frequent in the myocardial infarction group (P < .0001). The odds ratio estimated by the combined analysis of the angiotensinogen-TT and ACE-DD genotypes (11.2) was markedly increased compared with that estimated separately from the angiotensinogen-TT (1.75) or ACE-DD (4.43) genotype. In the second study, we investigated 91 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction who underwent successful direct angioplasty. Combined analysis showed that the angiotensinogen-TT genotype did not enhance the predictability of myocardial infarction from the ACE-DD genotype.

Nevertheless, previous studies have hardly examined the effects of age on the proportion of variation explained by single nucleotide polymorphisms (PVSNP) in these traits.

Restricted maximum likelihood estimates of the PVSNP were obtained in a mixed model framework. Previous studies using pedigree data suggested possible differential heritability of certain traits with regard to gender, which we observed in our current study (BMI and TG; P\u2009<\u20090.05).

A validation cohort included an additional 1049 patients with early-onset diabetes who were free of renal disease at baseline and were recruited after 1998. Associations of PRKCB1 polymorphisms under additive, dominant, and recessive genetic models with new onset of ESRD (defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate <15 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or dialysis or renal-related death) were assessed by Cox proportional hazard regression, adjusted for all conventional risk factors including use of medications. After a mean (SD) of 7.9 (1.9) years, 90 patients (7.7%) progressed to ESRD. Four common SNPs were associated with ESRD (P < .05).

Four common variants predicted ESRD in separate models. The HR for ESRD increased with increasing number of risk alleles (P < .001) in the joint effect analysis.

Few gene polymorphisms have been identified so far with a modest effect on lifespan leaving room for the search of other players in the longevity game.

Based on the above study in mice, here we sought to search for AGTR1 variations associated to reduced AT1 receptor protein levels and to prolonged lifespan in humans. AGTR1 was sequenced in 173 Italian centenarians and 376 younger controls. A novel non-synonymous mutation was detected in a centenarian. Two polymorphisms in AGTR1 promoter, rs422858 and rs275653, in complete linkage disequilibrium, were significantly associated with the ability to attain extreme old age. We then replicated the study of rs275653 in a large independent cohort of Japanese origin (598 centenarians and semi-supercentenarians, 422 younger controls) and indeed confirmed its association with exceptional old age. In combined analyses, rs275653 was associated to extreme longevity either at recessive model (P = 0.007, odds ratio (OR) 3.57) or at genotype level (P = 0.015). Significance was maintained after correcting for confounding factors. Fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis revealed that subjects homozygous for the minor allele of rs275653 had less AT1R-positive peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cells.

{"abstract": "Methamphetamine (MAP) dissipates proton gradients across the membranes of synaptic vesicles, enhances cytoplasmic dopamine (DA) concentrations, and causes calcium-independent, nonvesicular DA release into synapses. MAP is taken into the cytosol by the dopamine transporter (DAT) on the synaptic terminals of DA neurons, and endogenous DA is concurrently released through the transporter by carrier exchange mechanisms, resulting in a robust increase in DA concentration in the synaptic clefts. The enhanced DA release through DAT by MAP is the main mechanism for the reinforcing effects of MAP. The complexes of alpha-synuclein and DAT facilitate membrane clustering of the DAT, thereby accelerating DA uptake in vitro. alpha-Synuclein has been shown to be overexpressed in the midbrain DA neurons of chronic cocaine abusers. The present study was performed to study the association between the alpha-synuclein gene polymorphisms and MAP psychosis/dependence in Japanese population. Since the T10A7 polymorphic site at the 5' end of the noncoding exon 1' in the alpha-synuclein gene is highly polymorphic, we analyzed the noncoding exon 1' and intron 1, including this polymorphic site by sequencing. We confirmed four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 1.38 kbp of the T10A7 polymorphic site. No significant difference was found in genotype or allele frequencies in the T10A7 polymorphic site between MAP psychotic/dependent and control subjects. We found significant association between three SNPs in the vicinity of this polymorphic site in intron 1 and MAP psychosis/dependence in female subjects, but not in males. These results suggest an association of the alpha-synuclein gene polymorphisms with MAP psychosis/dependence in our female subjects. Further analyses are necessary to clarify the gender difference, by using a larger sample size and/or different ethnic groups, as well as functional variations in the alpha-synuclein gene.", "title": "Study of association between alpha-synuclein gene polymorphism and methamphetamine psychosis/dependence.", "pmid": "15542733", "id": "1796"},

As part of our ongoing investigations into the genetic basis of hypertension, we examined common sequence variants in the gene for association with hypertension, obesity and altered lipid profile in two populations of Japanese and Chinese descent. We re-sequenced all exons, selected intronic sequences and the promoter region in 24 individuals from our cohort. Fourteen SNPs were discovered, and six of these spanning 78 kb were genotyped in 1553 individuals from 672 families. All six SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium, and we found strong association of common risk haplotypes with hypertension in Chinese and Japanese (P<0.0001). In addition, individual SNPs showed association to total plasma cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and VLDL-cholesterol levels, as well as obesity measures (body mass index).

To examine the association, we genotyped one promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) [rs10004195 (-113T/A)] and three missense SNPs [rs11096957 (Asn241His), rs11096955 (Ile369Leu), and rs4129009 (Ile775Val)] using direct sequencing in 199 IgAN patients and 289 control subjects. Our case-control analysis showed that rs10004195 was associated with IgAN (codominant model, p = 0.016 in TT vs. TA; p = 0.044 in TT vs. AA; dominant model, p = 0.0068). In addition, when comparing the proteinuria level of IgAN patients according to the genotypes of each SNP, we found that in dominant model of rs1004195, the level of proteinuria of patients with TA or AA genotypes (median, 4.01 mg/m(2)/h) was higher than that of patients with TT genotype (2.00 mg/m\u00b2/h, p = 0.033). In conclusion, these results suggest that TLR10 gene may be associated with susceptibility to IgAN in Korean children.", "title": "Association between toll-like receptor 10 (TLR10) gene polymorphisms and childhood IgA nephropathy.", "pmid": "20953797", "id": "1813"},
{"abstract": "The angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism has been reported to be implicated in susceptibility to coronary heart disease (CHD). However, this association remains inconclusive. The purpose of this study was to clarify the association between the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene and the development of CHD in a Japanese general population and investigate whether the effects of traditional risk factors on the risk of CHD are heterogeneous among ACE genotypes. The subjects included 2,125 community-dwelling individuals 40 years of age or older without cardiovascular disease for whom genetic information was available. All patients were prospectively followed for 19 years, and the association between the ACE polymorphism and the incidence of CHD was examined based on the interactions with traditional risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes and smoking. A total of 161 CHD events occurred during the follow-up period. The age- and sex-adjusted incidence of CHD was not significantly different among the genotypes (5.8, 5.2, and 6.9 per 1,000person-years for genotypes II, ID and DD, respectively). In a stratified analysis, however, the ACE DD genotype was found to significantly accelerate the risk of developing CHD by hypercholesterolemia (hazard ratio [HR]=4.50, 95% confidence interval=2.02-10.04 for hypercholesterolemia with the DD genotype; HR=1.48, 95% CI=1.04-2.12 for hypercholesterolemia with the ID\uff0bII genotype; P for interaction=0.01), even after adjusting for other confounding factors, whereas no such associations were observed for hypertension, diabetes or smoking. The current findings suggest that the ACE DD genotype enhances the effect of hypercholesterolemia on the development of CHD in the general Japanese population.", "title": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme gene polymorphism enhances the effect of hypercholesterolemia on the risk of coronary heart disease in a general Japanese population: the hisayama study.", "pmid": "25342476", "id": "1814"},
{"abstract": "Ethanol is almost totally broken down by oxidative metabolism in vivo. Ethanol per se is considered to be neither carcinogenic, mutagenic nor genotoxic. However, during the metabolic conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde and acetate, the organism is exposed to both ethanol and acetaldehyde and therefore ethanol is suspected to be co-carcinogenic. The genetic polymorphisms of alcohol dehydrogenase-2 (ADH1B) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) influence the metabolism of alcohol. The ADH1B*1/*1 genotype encodes the low-activity form of ADH1B, and ALDH2*1/*2 and ALDH2*2/*2 genotype encode inactive ALDH2. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that polymorphisms of the ADH1B and ALDH2 genes are significantly associated with genotoxicity induced by alcohol drinking, measured using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay, an established biomarker of genome instability, in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 286 healthy Japanese men. There was a significant trend for the mean micronuclei (MN) frequency in habitual or moderate drinkers without a smoking habit to increase as the numbers of the *1 allele in ADH1B increased (P=0.039 or P=0.029) and the *2 allele in ALDH2 increased (P=0.019 or P=0.037). A logistic regression analysis showed that the number of subjects with MN frequency levels more than median value of MN (3.0) was significantly higher in the subjects with the ADH1B*1 allele as adjusted estimates (OR 2.08, 95% C.I. 1.24-3.48), when the OR for the subjects with the ADH1B*2/*2 genotype was defined as 1.00. The number of subjects with MN frequency levels more than median value of MN was also significantly higher in the subjects with the ALDH2*2 allele as adjusted estimates (OR 1.79, 95% C.I. 1.04-3.11), when the OR for the subjects with the ALDH2*1/*1 genotype was defined as 1.00.

The goal of this study is to test association between HOXB13 genetic variants and PCa risk in Chinese men. All study subjects were part of the Chinese Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ChinaPCa). In the first stage, we screened for mutations by sequencing the HOXB13 coding region in 96 unrelated PCa patients. In stage 2, G84E and novel mutations found in stage 1 were genotyped in 671 PCa patients and 1,536 controls. In stage 3, mutation status in 751 additional PCa patients was imputed via haplotype. The G84E mutation was not detected in this study. However, a novel mutation, G135E, was identified among 96 patients in stage 1. It was also observed twice in 575 additional PCa patients but not in 1,536 control subjects of stage 2. The frequency of G135E was significantly different between cases and controls, with a P-value of 0.027, based on Fisher's exact test. Haplotype estimation showed that G135E mutation carriers shared a unique haplotype that was not observed in other subjects. In stage 3, two more PCa patients were predicted to carry the G135E mutation. We identified a novel rare mutation in the HOXB13 gene, G135E, which appears to be a founder mutation. This mutation is associated with increased PCa risk in Chinese men.

It was recently found that earwax type is determined by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), 538G>A (Gly180Arg), in ABCC11. The G allele determines the wet type of earwax as a Mendelian trait with a dominant phenotype. The present study examined the association between the frequency rate of breast cancer and the frequency of the G allele of ABCC11. Using blood samples from patients with invasive breast cancer (n = 270) and control volunteers (n = 273), the 538G>A SNP in ABCC11 was genotyped using the SmartAmp method. The frequency of the G allele in breast cancer patients was higher than that in healthy controls. The odds ratio for the genotypes (G/G+G/A) to develop breast cancer was estimated to be 1.63 (p-value = 0.026), suggesting that the G allele in ABCC11 is associated with breast cancer risk. This study showed that Japanese women with wet earwax have a higher relative risk of developing breast cancer than those with dry earwax.

Anthropometric measurements, fasting glucose, insulin and lipid profiles were measured in 253 Korean females. Homeostatic model assessments and quantitative insulin sensitivity check indices were calculated. Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed according to the NCEP-ATP III guidelines and the Western Pacific Region of WHO for obesity criteria for waist circumference. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment-length polymorphism and real-time PCR were performed for genotyping of the DNAs. For C161T polymorphism, allele frequencies were 0.804 and 0.196 for T allele, and 0.947 for proline and 0.053 for alanine. There was no Ala12Ala homozygote in the population. No differences were seen in the mean values of age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, fasting blood glucose level, fasting insulin levels, HOMA and QUICKI among different genotypes when analyzed as a whole, except that subjects with Pro12Ala had significantly higher body weight than those with Pro12Pro genotype. However, mean BMI, percent body fat and weight showed significant differences between genotypes in younger age group (< or =50 years). Although overall prevalence of metabolic syndrome had no association with the genotypes, the prevalence of decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol component was lower in those with the T allele than in those with the CC genotype.

Compared with the major G allele, the BDKRB2 rs11847625 minor C allele was significantly associated with increased systolic blood pressure responses to low-sodium intervention (P = 0.0001). Furthermore, a haplotype containing allele C was associated with an increased systolic blood pressure response to high-sodium intervention (P = 0.0009). Seven highly correlated ECE1 SNPs were shown to increase the diastolic blood pressure response to low-sodium intervention (P values ranged from 0.0003 to 0.002), with 2 haplotypes containing these 7 SNPs also associated with this same phenotype (P values ranged from 0.0004 to 0.002).

The strengths of the associations between IL-6 polymorphisms and gastric cancer risk were estimated by odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI).

Apo E2 allele frequency was significantly higher in diabetic patients with renal failure (9.6%) than in diabetic patients without renal failure (3.2%) and in the general Japanese population (3.7%). This finding suggests that apo E2 is associated with renal failure in NIDDM.

In diabetic patients, the apo E2 group with renal failure had significantly higher levels of plasma total cholesterol (T-chol), very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-chol, triglyceride (TG), VLDL-TG and apo E than the apo E3/3 group with renal failure, and had significantly higher levels of plasma T-chol, VLDL-chol, TG and VLDL-TG than the apo E2 and E3/3 groups with normoalbuminuria.

All three polymorphisms in the ARMS2/HTRA1 region were in almost complete linkage disequilibrium. Haplotype analyses showed the existence of only two common haplotypes, together comprising 98.9%. Regression analyses showed that the level of hs-CRP was positively correlated with increasing age.

{"abstract": "It has recently been shown that GAB2 alleles modify the risk for late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) in apolipoprotein E (ApoE)epsilon4 allele carriers in a genome-wide association study. Some studies subsequently in Caucasians population, though not all, have demonstrated that GAB2 polymorphisms might be associated with LOAD susceptibility. The aim of this study is to evaluate the reported polymorphisms (rs2373115 and rs1385600) and GAB2 haplotypes (rs2373115-rs1385600) for an interaction with the ApoEepsilon4 allele in a cohort of Chinese LOAD.

{"abstract": "Leptin plays an important role in the regulation of body weight and is known to circulate in both free and bound forms. One of the leptin receptor isoforms exists in a circulating soluble form that can bind leptin. Clinical studies have shown that soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R) levels are lower in obese individuals. In the present study, we measured the serum sOB-R level in 419 healthy Japanese subjects (198 men and 221 women, aged 30 to 65 years, body mass index [BMI] 21.7 +/- 2.6 [SD] kg/m2) and in 150 type 2 diabetic patients (96 men and 54 women, BMI 24.3 +/- 3.8 kg/m2). We investigated the relationships between serum sOB-R level and BMI, blood pressure, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), serum leptin and adiponectin levels, lipid profile, and leptin receptor (LEPR) gene Lys109Arg and Gln223Arg polymorphisms. Serum leptin and sOB-R levels were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. The serum sOB-R level in men was significantly higher than that in women. The serum sOB-R level was negatively correlated with BMI, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and serum leptin level and positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and serum adiponectin levels. The correlations between serum sOB-R level and fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, serum leptin, adiponectin, and HDL-cholesterol levels were significant even after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI in healthy subjects. There was no association between serum sOB-R level and the LEPR polymorphisms examined. These findings suggest that the serum sOB-R level is negatively correlated with HOMA-IR and serum leptin level and positively correlated with HDL-cholesterol level and serum adiponectin level, independent of age, sex, and BMI, in the Japanese population.", "title": "Relationships between serum soluble leptin receptor level and serum leptin and adiponectin levels, insulin resistance index, lipid profile, and leptin receptor gene polymorphisms in the Japanese population.", "pmid": "15254881", "id": "1851"},

Although two susceptibility loci were identified on chromosome 2p24 (ETM2) and 3q13 (ETM1 or FET1), the exact transcript(s) has not been cloned. We analyzed unrelated Korean individuals with ET for a genetic association with three reported polymorphic loci (STS-etm1240, STS-etm1231, and STS-etm1234) in a candidate region on chromosome 2p24.1. We investigated sequence polymorphisms at these three loci in 30 ET patients and 30 controls using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by sequence analysis. Eight different sequence variants (5 at etm1234, 2 at etm1240, and 1 at etm1231) were detected from 7 patients. Of interest, sequence variants were found only in classic ET patients but not in nonclassic ET patients and healthy individuals. Additionally, we also observed that a decrease in the number of short tandem repeats within etm1234 locus is more frequent in ET patients compared to controls. Our data thus support that ET development would be linked with the ETM2 locus and will facilitate the search for the ETM2 gene transcript.", "title": "Frequent sequence variation at the ETM2 locus and its association with sporadic essential tremor in Korea.", "pmid": "16092108", "id": "1852"},
{"abstract": "Genetic factors are important in defining total serum IgE levels. Linkage analyses have localized a gene or genes that influence atopic phenotype at chromosome 11q13. Variants of the FCER1B gene have been identified, which are associated with an increased risk of developing atopy and bronchial asthma. Given uncertain functional consequences and low frequencies of these coding variants of FCER1B, we screened for new mutations using 24 subjects with atopic asthma. A common -109C/T polymorphism at the promoter region of FCER1B was identified, although no variant was found in the entire coding region. We genotyped this promoter polymorphism in 226 healthy control subjects and 226 asthmatic subjects using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. Allele frequencies were 0.697 for -109T and 0.303 for -109C in 226 healthy control subjects. No significant difference in the distribution of -109C/T polymorphism was found between asthmatic subjects and healthy control subjects. A homozygosity for the -109T allele, however, was associated with increased total serum IgE levels in 226 subjects with asthma (p = 0.0015). The strongest evidence for an association between total serum IgE levels and -109C/T polymorphism (p = 0.0004) was obtained when age at onset of asthma was incorporated into the analysis. Our findings may represent genetic heterogeneity and complex interactions between genetic and environmental components involved in the regulation of total IgE levels, providing evidence that the -109C/T polymorphism of the FCER1B promoter region is one of the genetic factors identified thus far, which affects total serum IgE levels in a Japanese population.", "title": "A common FCER1B gene promoter polymorphism influences total serum IgE levels in a Japanese population.", "pmid": "10712341", "id": "1853"},

Ethnic differences in the frequencies of these genotypes have also been reported. To date, most of these studies have been performed in white and Japanese populations. In this study, we examined the associations between albuminuria and RAS genetic polymorphisms in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. In a case-control study, the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) gene, the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene (M235T), and the angiotensin II (AII) type 1 receptor gene (AT1 A1166C) were examined in 110 Chinese type 2 diabetic patients. Increased urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was defined as > or = 30 mg/day on at least two occasions during a 6-week study period. Compared with whites, there were high frequencies of the AGT TT genotype in Chinese control subjects (120/183 = 70%) and type 2 diabetic patients (74/110 = 67%). The frequencies of the MM genotype were 5 and 3%, respectively, and those of the ACE DD genotype were 13 and 10%, respectively. Although 9% of subjects carried the C allele, the AT1 CC genotype was not found in either group. Chinese type 2 diabetic patients with increased albuminuria (n = 56) had higher systolic blood pressure (160 +/- 26 mmHg vs 145 +/- 27 mmHg, P < 0.001) than the normoalbuminuric patients (n = 54). Both the AGT TT genotype (78.6% [44/56] vs. 55.6% [30/54], odds ratio [OR]: 3.0 [1.3-6.8]) and the T allele (88% [99/112] vs. 77% [83/108], OR: 2.5 [1.3-5.4]) were associated with an increased risk of albuminuria.

Although various loci and genes have been implicated in predisposition to hypertension by genetic linkage analyses and candidate gene association studies, the genes that confer susceptibility to this condition remain to be identified definitively. We examined the relations of nine candidate gene polymorphisms to blood pressure (BP) and the prevalence of hypertension in a population-based study. The 2238 subjects (1110 women, 1128 men) were aged 40 to 79 years and were randomly recruited for a population-based prospective cohort study of aging and age-related diseases in Japan.

Genotypes for the 160C-->T (Arg54Trp) polymorphism of QPCT, the C-->T (Pro198Leu) polymorphism of GPX1, the 137,346T-->C polymorphism of FYN, the -344C-->T polymorphism of CYP11B2, and the A-->G (Ser49Gly) polymorphism of ADRB1 were determined with a fluorescence-based allele-specific DNA primer assay system; those for the A-->G polymorphism of CNR2, the I/D (22,375delAC) polymorphism of CAV1, and the -1213T-->C polymorphism of ESR2 by melting curve analysis, and that for the (GT)n polymorphism of COL1A2 were determined by DNA fragment analysis. The polymorphism of FYN was associated with systolic and diastolic BP in women. In men, polymorphisms of CNR2, QPCT, GPX1, COL1A2, CYP11B2, and ESR2 were associated with systolic and diastolic BP, those of CAV1 and FYN with systolic BP, and that of ADRB1 with diastolic BP. The polymorphisms of QPCT and CYP11B2 were also associated with the prevalence of hypertension in men.

Apo A-IV has been suggested as participating in several stages of reverse cholesterol transport. Uncertainty about the exact biochemical function of apo A-IV has made the use of genetic apo A-IV polymorphism (variants) attractive in evaluating its physiological role. To date, although some reports indicate that DNA polymorphisms at this locus play an important role in the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins in western (Caucasian) populations, no similar comprehensive analysis has been performed in a distinct Japanese population. Using DNA sequencing and a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) study with polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the following allele frequencies were established: (a) codon -8 (G-->A, non-synonymous) allele 2 = 0 (n = 105); (b) codon 9 (A-->G, synonymous) allele 2 = 0.388 (n = 152); (c) codon 347 (A-->T, non-synonymous) allele 2 = 0 (n = 900); (d) codon 360 (T-->G, non-synonymous) allele 2 = 0 (n = 800); (e) VNTR exon 3 [(CTGT)3 and (CTGT)4] (CTGT)3 = 0.262 (n = 105); and (f) MspI (newly detected polymorphic site) polymorphism (C C/T GG) within intron 2, allele 2 = 0.096 (n = 193). The frequencies of these polymorphisms, except for that of the newly identified MspI site, are completely different from those reported in western populations. Among the 900 subjects examined, we found one ACT (Thr) to ACG (Thr) synonymous mutation at codon 347, which does not change the primary structure of apo A-IV. The apo A-IV allele frequency in patients (166 men and 56 women) with angiographically proven coronary heart disease (CHD) was also studied [codon 9 allele 2 = 0.329 (n = 217); VNTR exon 3 (CTGT)3 = 0.262 (n = 84); MspI within intron 2, allele 2 = 0.092 (n = 222)]. Furthermore, we evaluated serum lipid and lipoprotein levels quantitatively in control subjects and Japanese CHD patients. These polymorphisms did not show any consistent and significant association with lipid and lipoprotein parameters.

Biomarkers of exposure, effect or susceptibility are required for risk assessment and for epidemiologic research studies especially in occupational settings. Since the surfactant protein system (SP) is very important for normal lung function and for mediating local airway conditions and in the clearance of the upper respiratory tract from the occupational and environmental dusts, we hypothesize that SP genes may represent good candidates to study susceptibility for lung cancer. Using PCR genotyping methods with gel electrophoresis and confirmation of results with precise DNA fragment size measurement on microchip electrophoresis, we analyzed SP-B intron-4 polymorphism in 230 subjects who were classified into groups; chromate-related lung cancer, control chromate workers who had not developed lung cancer, control individuals with non chromate-related adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the lungs, or healthy Japanese control individuals. Our results indicated that the SP-B variants (deletion/insertion) were significantly overrepresented (61.3%) in the chromate-related lung cancer group than other groups (X2 = 47.6; DF = 4, P = 0.0001). There was a significant difference between the chromate lung cancer group and both of the control groups, healthy individuals and chromate workers who did not develop lung cancer, showing odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 21.9 (7.3-65.7) and 19.0 (3.78-95.4), respectively.

These findings indicate a very strong association of the SP-B intron-4 variants with mechanisms that may enhance lung cancer susceptibility, especially in workers who are employed in chromate industry. Moreover, confirmation of such results may help to suggest adding the SP-B intron-4 typing to be one of the screening tests of the pre-placement medical examination to confirm that the worker has no variations of the SP-B gene before being engaged in a chromium-related industry, with the intention of providing proper medical counseling.", "title": "Surfactant protein B gene variations and susceptibility to lung cancer in chromate workers.", "pmid": "16570259", "id": "1860"},

{"abstract": "The G870A polymorphism in the CCND1 gene may influence cancer risk. However, data from published studies with individual low statistical power have been controversial. To evaluate whether combined evidence shows an association between this polymorphism and cancer, we considered all available studies in a meta-analysis. Sixty studies were combined representing data for 18,411 cases and 22,209 controls. In our meta-analysis, we investigated overall sample and two ethnic populations (Caucasians and Asians) as well as nine cancer subtypes. Individuals who are homozygous for A allele (AA) were found to be associated with significantly increased cancer risk in overall sample [odds ratio (OR), 1.23; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.13-1.33; P <or= 0.0001], Caucasians (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.07-1.26; P=0.0002), and Asians (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.14-1.39; P <or= 0.001). Among the nine cancer subtypes investigated, modestly significant risk (ORs, 1.08 to 1.51; P=0.02 to 0.04) was detected in breast, colorectal, head and neck, and other cancers. Highly significant and increased risk was found to be associated with genitourinary (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.20-1.89; P=0.0004) and blood-related cancers (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.28-2.05; P <or= 0.0001). Individuals who are heterozygous for AG were found to be at increased risk in overall, ethnic groups, as well as breast and colorectal cancers. Significant dominant effects seem to prevail in the majority of the categories investigated, where some recessive effects were also detected. Overall, the risk effects associated with this polymorphism were small; however, due its common occurrence, it affects a large portion of the human population (AA, 25%; AG, 50%). Although the independent small risk associated with CCND1-A870G polymorphism is not clinically useful, its interaction with other genetic variants and environmental factors has been shown to be associated with further increase in cancer risk (OR, 1.6-7.1). In conclusion, our study strongly supports the increased cancer risk associated with CCND1-A870G polymorphism in the human population.", "title": "Cyclin D1 Pro241Pro (CCND1-G870A) polymorphism is associated with increased cancer risk in human populations: a meta-analysis.", "pmid": "18843022", "id": "1867"},
{"abstract": "Cytochrome P450 1A1 plays a major role in the bioactivation of a number of tobacco procarcinogens. Much interest has focused on a polymorphism in exon 7 of the CYP1A1 gene which has been associated with a more inducible form of the enzyme. However, past results of its association with lung cancer have been inconsistent, especially in Caucasians. We carried out a pooled analysis of the data submitted to the Genetic Susceptibility to Environmental Carcinogens (GSEC) database to further investigate this association and, especially, to examine the modifying effects of smoking status and race. The data set used in this analysis included 11 studies and a total of 1950 cases and 2617 controls. Both fixed- and random-effects, meta-analysis models were used to investigate heterogeneity among studies. Because no clear heterogeneity was found, a pooled analysis was conducted using unconditional logistic regression. The pooled odds ratio for subjects heterozygous and homozygous for the exon 7 polymorphism was 1.15 (95% confidence interval: 0.95-1.39) and 1.54 (95% CI: 0.97-1.46), respectively (p for gene-dosage effect: 0.03). This association was stronger for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) than adenocarcinoma, and appeared to be stronger in Caucasians than Asians (p for interaction: 0.03). Statistically significant interactions were also detected for smoking status and sex, with the effect of the polymorphism being stronger in never-smokers and in females. The present data suggest that the CYP1A1 exon 7 polymorphism may confer an increased risk of lung cancer, particularly of SCC, and especially in never-smokers and in women.

{"abstract": "The dysregulation of the dopaminergic system has been implicated in the pathophysiology of major psychosis, including schizophrenia, with dopamine receptor genes (DRDs) presently targeted as the most promising candidate genes. We investigated DRD1-5 for association with schizophrenia using a multi-stage approach in a Korean sample. One hundred forty-two SNPs in DRD1-5 were selected from the dbSNP, and the associations of each SNP were then screened and typed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using pooled DNA samples from 150 patients with major psychosis and 150 controls. Each of the suggested SNPs was then genotyped and tested for an association within the individual samples comprising each pool. Finally, the positively associated SNPs were genotyped in an extended sample of 270 patients with schizophrenia and 350 controls. Among the 142 SNPs, 88 (62%) SNPs in our Korean population were polymorphic. At the pooling stage, 10 SNPs (DRD1: 2, DRD2: 3, and DRD4: 5) were identified (P<0.05). SNPs rs1799914 of DRD1 (P=0.046) and rs752306 of DRD4 (P=0.017) had significantly different allele frequencies in the individually genotyped samples comprising the pool. In the final stage, with the extended sample, the suggestive association of DRD4 with rs752306 was lost, but the association of DRD1 with rs1799914 gained greater significance (P=0.017). In these large-scale multi-stage analyses, we were able to find a possible association between DRD1 and schizophrenia.

The wild-type p53 gene has a polymorphism at codon 72 that presents the arginine (CGC) or proline (CCC) genotype, which recently has been reported to be associated with genetically determined susceptibility to smoking-related lung cancers. To determine whether this p53 genotype influences individual risk of urologic cancer and/or its progression, we used polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis to assay the allelic frequencies of this polymorphism in 85 renal cell carcinoma patients, 151 urothelial cancer patients, 33 testicular cancer patients, 28 prostatic cancer patients and 56 patients without neoplastic disease. The allelic distributions of the three genotypes (Arg/Arg, Arg/Pro, Pro/Pro) in patients with renal cell carcinoma (29.4%, 55.3%, 15.3%), urothelial cancers (45.7%, 39.7%, 14.6%), testicular cancer (45.4%, 48.5%, 6.1%) or prostate cancer (42.9%, 50.0%, 7.1%) did not differ significantly from those in the normal controls. However, Pro/Pro genotype in renal cell carcinoma and urothelial cancer (smoking-related cancers) was more frequent than that in prostate cancer and testicular cancer (smoking-unrelated cancers) with borderline significance (P = 0.0881).

A physical examination was performed and fasting blood was collected for biochemical tests, including determination of the levels of serum lipid, creatinine, and uric acid. Multi-ARMS PCR was applied to determine the APOE genotypes, followed by an investigation of the distribution of APOE genotypes and alleles frequencies in the controls and cases. The frequencies of the APOE-\u03b52\u03b53 genotype (17.70% vs. 10.39%, P\u200a=\u200a0.003) and the APOE-\u03b52 allele (10.53% vs. 5.80%, P\u200a=\u200a0.001) were significantly higher in the hyperuricemic group than in the normouricemic group. Furthermore, male cases were more likely to have the APOE-\u03b52\u03b53 genotype and APOE-\u03b52 allele, compared with male controls. In both Han and Hui subjects, cases were more likely to have the APOE-\u03b52\u03b53 genotype and the APOE-\u03b52 allele compared with controls. Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression showed that carriers of the APOE-\u03b52\u03b53 genotype (P\u200a=\u200a0.001, OR\u200a=\u200a2.194) and the \u03b52 allele (P\u200a=\u200a0.001, OR\u200a=\u200a2.099) were significantly more likely to experience hyperuricemia than carriers of the \u03b53/\u03b53 genotype and the \u03b53 allele after adjustment for sex, body mass index (BMI), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), creatinine (Cr) and fasting blood glucose (FBG). The APOE-\u03b52\u03b53 genotype and the APOE-\u03b52 allele are associated with serum uric acid levels in Chinese subjects, indicating that individuals carrying the APOE-\u03b52 allele have a higher risk of hyperuricemia than non-carriers.", "title": "Apolipoprotein E gene polymorphisms are associated with primary hyperuricemia in a Chinese population.", "pmid": "25356596", "id": "1884"},

{"abstract": "A convincing genetic association with hip osteoarthritis (OA) of a functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the core promoter of the calmodulin 1 gene CALM1 was recently reported in a Japanese population. The T-allele of the SNP encoded OA susceptibility and this was mediated by a reduced expression of CALM1. Our objective was to assess whether the SNP was also associated with hip OA in UK Caucasians. The SNP was genotyped in 920 cases that had undergone elective joint replacement of the hip due to end-stage primary OA and in 752 age-matched controls. Our study had greater than 97% power to observe an effect comparable to that seen in the Japanese study. However, there was no significant difference (P< or =0.05) in genotype or allele frequencies between our cases and our controls. There was also no significant difference when the cases were stratified by sex.

{"abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic arthritic condition that can lead to deformities and disabilities. Although numerous studies reported the association of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1*04 and RA, other genes, e.g. cytokines genes, may contribute towards disease susceptibility. Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a proinflammatory cytokine postulated to play a role in the acute and chronic inflammatory phases of RA. The IL-18 protein expression seems to be regulated by two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located at positions -607 and -137 in the promoter region of the gene. It is postulated that specific alleles may be associated with susceptibility to the development of RA. In the present study, we described the IL-18 gene promoter region genotypes and combined genotypes (-607/-137) in 106 RA patients and 273 unrelated healthy controls to evaluate the contributions of these alleles to RA predisposition in Chinese, Malays, and Indians. The genotyping were performed using sequence-specific polymerase chain reactions. Rheumatoid factors were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Biodata were obtained through chart review. The controls had significantly higher frequency of AA genotype at position -607 when compared to RA patients. No significant differences were observed in the distribution of either allelic or genotypic frequencies at position -137. There was no association between the genotypes and the presence of rheumatoid factors. This study did not find evidence of a genetic susceptibility factor but demonstrated the novel finding that the AA genotype at position -607 is associated with a protective effect against development of RA in Chinese individuals. This protection may be mediated through inhibition of cyclic (Adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate) AMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding protein by the disruption of the CRE consensus sequence.", "title": "Single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the interleukin-18 gene promoter region in rheumatoid arthritis patients: protective effect of AA genotype.", "pmid": "14617033", "id": "1892"},

The present study explores the nucleotide variability and phylogeny of the high-risk HPV-31, -33, -35, -52, and -58, in samples from Central Brazil. For this purpose, the LCR and the E6 and L1 genes were sequenced. Several variants of these HPV types were detected, some of which have been detected in other parts of the world. Furthermore, new variants of all types examined were characterized in a total of 13 new variants. Based on the E6 and L1 sequences, variants were described comprising conservative and non-conservative amino acid changes. For phylogenetic tree construction, samples characterized in this study were compared to others described and submitted to GenBank previously. The phylogenetic analysis of HPV-31, -33, -35, and -58 isolates did not reveal ethnic or geographical clustering as observed previously for HPV-16 and -18. HPV-35 analysis showed a dichotomic branching characteristic of viral subtypes. Interestingly, four clusters relative to the analysis of HPV-52 isolates were identified, two of which could be classified as Asian and European branches.

Using an \"expanding window\" approach (100-1,600\u00a0kb) for the individual loci as well as the loci as ensembles, we find a high degree of differentiation for the ensemble of T2D loci. This differentiation is most pronounced for East Asians and sub-Saharan Africans, suggesting that these groups experienced natural selection at loci associated with T2D. Haplotype analysis suggests an excess of obesity loci with evidence of recent positive selection among South Asians and Europeans, compared to sub-Saharan Africans and Native Americans. We also identify individual loci that may have been subjected to natural selection, such as the T2D locus, HHEX, which displays both elevated differentiation and extended haplotype homozygosity in comparisons of East Asians with other groups.

{"abstract": "Genetic polymorphisms for cytokines and their receptors have been proposed as potential markers for periodontal disease. Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) is one of the cell surface receptors for TNF-alpha. Recent studies have suggested that TNFR2 gene polymorphism is involved in autoimmune and other diseases. The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether TNFR2(+587T/G) gene polymorphism is associated with chronic periodontitis (CP). One hundred and ninety-six unrelated subjects (age 40-65 years) with different levels of CP were identified according to established criteria, including measurements of probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and alveolar bone loss (BL). All subjects were of Japanese descent and non-smokers. Single nucleotide polymorphism at position +587(T/G) in the TNFR2 gene was detected by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) method. The frequency and the positivity of the +587G allele were significantly higher in severe CP patients than in controls (p=0.0097; odds ratio=2.61, p=0.0075; odds ratio=3.06). In addition, mean values of PPD, CAL, and BL were significantly higher in the +587G allele positive than in the negative subjects (p=0.035, 0.022, and 0.018, respectively).

Southeast Asian Ovalocytic (SAO) band 3, an inactive and misfolded protein, is probably only maintained in certain populations because it provides protection against the cerebral form of malaria. Many mutations that cause instability of band 3, either at the mRNA or protein level, result in hereditary spherocytosis (HS). Some polymorphisms alter amino acid residues in the extracellular loops of band 3 and are associated with blood group antigens. A truncated form of AEI is expressed in kidney cells and certain AEI mutations are associated with distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA). The molecular basis of these variants and their effect on the structure and function of band 3 are discussed.

The aim in the study is to analyze the potential association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of GRP78 and the risk of T2D. To assess the association between GRP78 polymorphisms and T2D, a case-control study was conducted among 1058 consecutive unrelated subjects. Of the 1058 subjects, 523 of them were diagnosed with T2D and 535 of them were healthy controls. Four SNPs with R(2)>0.8 and the minor allele frequency>0.05 (rs391957, rs17840761, rs17840762, and rs11355458) in the GRP78 gene promoter were analyzed. Overall, no associations of GRP78 polymorphisms with T2D were observed in genotypic analyses. In addition, haplotypes combining those SNPs in the promoter in high linkage disequilibrium were also not associated with a T2D risk.

{"abstract": "Drug treatment of epilepsy is characterized by unpredictability of efficacy, adverse drug reactions, and optimal doses in individual patients, which, at least in part, is a consequence of genetic variation. Since genetic variability in drug metabolism was reported to affect the treatment with phenytoin more than 25 years ago, the ultimate goal of pharmacogenetics is to use the genetic makeup of an individual to predict drug response and efficacy, as well as potential adverse drug events. However, determining the practical relevance of pharmacogenetic variants remains difficult, in part because of problems with study design and replication. This article reviews the published work with particular emphasis on pharmacogenetic alterations that may affect efficacy, tolerability, and safety of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including variation in genes encoding drug target (SCN1A), drug transport (ABCB1), drug metabolizing (CYP2C9, CYP2C19), and human leucocyte antigen (HLA) proteins. Although the current studies associating particular genes and their variants with seizure control or adverse events have inherent weaknesses and have not provided unifying conclusions, several results, for example that Asian patients with a particular HLA allele, HLA-B*1502, are at a higher risk for Stevens-Johnson syndrome when using carbamazepine, are helpful to increase our knowledge how genetic variation affects the treatment of epilepsy.

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, performed with a cohort of 31 schizophrenics and 31 controls of US population, showed 21.7% reduction in the expression of the long isoform beta(2L), 13.4% in the short isoform beta(2S) and 15.8% in the sum of the two isoforms beta(2T) in postmortem schizophrenic brain. Furthermore, two independent mRNA quantitation methods showed that the relative expression of the long over the short isoforms was significantly decreased, suggesting the occurrence of altered splicing, in schizophrenia. In male schizophrenics, the heterozygous genotypes of rs1876071 (T/C) and rs1876072 (A/G) were correlated with reduced expression of beta(2L), beta(2S) and beta(2T), and the heterozygous of rs2546620 (A/G) and homozygous-minor of rs1876071 (C/C) and rs1876072 (G/G) were correlated with reduced expression of beta(2T). Significant correlations of expression levels with different alleles and haplotypes were also indicated by quantitative trait analysis. Recombinant GABA(A) receptors expressed in HEK293 human cells containing beta(2L) underwent a steeper current rundown upon repetitive GABA activation than receptors containing beta(2S). The results thus revealed genotype-dependent expression of the alternatively spliced isoforms of GABA(A) receptor beta2 subunit, giving rise to electrophysiological consequences that could play an important role in the pathogenesis mechanism of schizophrenia.", "title": "Two isoforms of GABA(A) receptor beta2 subunit with different electrophysiological properties: Differential expression and genotypical correlations in schizophrenia.", "pmid": "16983389", "id": "1924"},
{"abstract": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is recently highlighted as a major health problem, and diastolic dysfunction associated with hypertension has a dominant role in the development of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Osteopontin (OPN) is a secreted phosphoprotein, which mediates fibrosis. In animal models, OPN is upregulated in response to pressure overload and is thought to be involved in systolic dysfunction. However, the functional role of OPN in diastolic dysfunction is unknown. The guanine base insertion polymorphism at -156 position of the OPN promoter is postulated to upregulate the transcription of OPN in human. To investigate whether -156del/G polymorphism of OPN promoter is associated with diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive hearts, the patients with hypertension have been genotyped for variants of -156del/G polymorphism by genomic sequencing. Diastolic function of the left ventricle was estimated as the ratio of early to atrial filling (E/A ratio), obtained by pulsed-Doppler derived transmitral flow in echocardiographic analysis. The patients with -156G allele displayed lower E/A ratio compared with those with -156del/del genotype, suggesting exacerbated diastolic function. Notably, in case of the population with diabetes mellitus, the patients with -156G allele showed significant association with lower E/A ratio, compared with -156del/-156del patients. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that prevalence of -156G allele was an independent factor for lowering E/A ratio. The -156del/G genetic variants of OPN promoter were associated with decreased E/A ratio in hypertensive patients. These results suggest that OPN has a functional role in the development of diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive hearts.", "title": "Association between osteopontin promoter variants and diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive heart in the Japanese population.", "pmid": "21796134", "id": "1925"},
{"abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that results in chronic inflammation of different organ systems. Several susceptibility loci for SLE have been suggested in different populations, but the nature of the susceptibility genes has yet to be determined. The programmed cell death 1 gene (PDCD1), the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) gene, and the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) are considered to be the candidate genes associated with SLE. We analyzed the role of PDCD1, CTLA4, and MECP2 gene polymorphisms in Han patients suffering from SLE. Using a case-control study, 263 SLE patients and 263 healthy controls were collected from Chinese Northern Han people. Genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral blood leukocytes and the genotyping was performed using a polymerase chain reaction/ligase detection reaction assay. A statistically significant difference was observed in the rs2239464 and rs2075596 polymorphisms of MECP2 between SLE subjects and controls. The GG genotype in rs2239464 and the GG genotype in rs2075596 might protect against SLE. In contrast, no such association was found in the CTLA4 or PDCD1 polymorphisms. The rs2239464 and rs2075596 polymorphisms of MECP2 might play a significant role in the development of SLE in the Northern Han of China.

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs3805246) in the Gab1 gene has been suggested to be related to the risk of Helicobacter pylori infection and chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) in a study from Japan. We aimed to assess the associations in a population-based study from Germany. In the baseline examination of ESTHER, a population-based study conducted in Saarland, serum pepsinogen I and II and H. pylori serostatus were measured by ELISA. The Gab1 SNP (rs3805246) was genotyped in 351 serologically defined CAG cases and 351 age- and sex-matched non-CAG controls. A nonsignificant association was observed between the Gab1 SNP and CAG, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.15 (0.85-1.55) for AA/AG carriers compared to GG carriers. The magnitude of the association did not change when the analysis was restricted to H. pylori seropositive subjects. Furthermore, no significant relation was found between the SNP and H. pylori seropositivity among non-CAG controls. We could not confirm a major association between Gab1 SNP (rs3805246) and the predisposition to H. pylori infection and CAG in this study population from Germany.

{"abstract": "Published data on the association between BRCA2 N372H polymorphism and breast cancer risk are inconclusive. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed. Crude ORs with 95% CIs were used to assess the strength of association between them. A total of 22 studies including 22,515 cases and 22,388 controls were involved in this meta-analysis. Overall, no significant associations were found between BRCA2 N372H polymorphism and breast cancer risk when all studies pooled into the meta-analysis (NH versus NN: OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.97-1.05; HH versus NN: OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.97-1.13; dominant model: OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.98-1.05; and recessive model: OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.98-1.13). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, still no significant associations were found for Caucasians, Asians, or Africans. When stratified by study design, statistically significantly elevated risk was found for 372H allele based on population-based studies (HH versus NN: OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.01-1.21; dominant model: OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.00-1.10; recessive model: OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.00-1.18).

To determine whether a particular subset of symptomatic lumbar disease is specifically associated with these polymorphisms, we performed a prospective case-control study of 107 patients who underwent surgery of the lumbar spine. Patients were assigned to one of five clinical categories (fracture, disc degeneration, disc herniation, spinal stenosis without spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis with spondylolisthesis) based on history, imaging results, and findings during surgery. Of the 11 tryptophan-positive patients, eight had spinal stenosis with spondylolisthesis and three had disc herniation. The presence of the tryptophan allele was significantly associated with African-American or Asian designation for race (odds ratio 4.61, 95% CI 0.63 to 25.35) and with the diagnosis of spinal stenosis with spondylolisthesis (odds ratio 6.81, 95% CI 1.47 to 41.95).

Mothers of children with NLE exhibited a very high polymorphism of HLA class I genes. Significant increases of HLA-B*1501 (B62) and Cw*0303 (Cw9) with absence of HLA-A1/B8 haplotype in Japanese mothers differed from the serologically defined HLA class I profiles among NLE mothers in white and North American black populations.

{"abstract": "Metabolic syndrome is defined as a cluster of multiple risk factors, including central obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance, that increase cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Genetic factors are important in the development of metabolic syndrome, as are environmental factors. However, the genetic background of metabolic syndrome is not yet fully clarified. There is evidence that obesity and obesity-related phenotypes are associated with variations in several genes, including NEGR1, SEC16B, TMEM18, ETV5, GNPDA2, BDNF, MTCH2, SH2B1, FTO, MAF, MC4R, KCTD15, SCG3, MTMR9, TFAP2B, MSRA, LYPLAL1, GCKR and FADS1. To investigate the relationship between metabolic syndrome and variations in these genes in the Japanese population, we genotyped 33 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 19 genes from 1096 patients with metabolic syndrome and 581 control individuals who had no risk factors for metabolic syndrome. Four SNPs in the FTO gene were significantly related to metabolic syndrome: rs9939609 (P=0.00013), rs8050136 (P=0.00011), rs1558902 (P=6.6 \u00d7 10(-5)) and rs1421085 (P=7.4 \u00d7 10(-5)). rs3764220 in the SCG3 gene (P=0.0010) and rs2293855 in the MTMR9 gene (P=0.0015) were also significantly associated with metabolic syndrome.

{"abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have detected many disease associations. However, the reported variants tend to explain small fractions of risk, and there are doubts about issues such as the portability of findings over different ethnic groups or the relative roles of rare versus common variants in the genetic architecture of complex disease. Studying the degree of sharing of disease-associated variants across populations can help in solving these issues. We present a comprehensive survey of GWAS replicability across 28 diseases. Most loci and SNPs discovered in Europeans for these conditions have been extensively replicated using peoples of European and East Asian ancestry, while the replication with individuals of African ancestry is much less common. We found a strong and significant correlation of Odds Ratios across Europeans and East Asians, indicating that underlying causal variants are common and shared between the two ancestries. Moreover, SNPs that failed to replicate in East Asians map into genomic regions where Linkage Disequilibrium patterns differ significantly between populations. Finally, we observed that GWAS with larger sample sizes have detected variants with weaker effects rather than with lower frequencies. Our results indicate that most GWAS results are due to common variants. In addition, the sharing of disease alleles and the high correlation in their effect sizes suggest that most of the underlying causal variants are shared between Europeans and East Asians and that they tend to map close to the associated marker SNPs.", "title": "High trans-ethnic replicability of GWAS results implies common causal variants.", "pmid": "23785302", "id": "1934"},

To date, six causative genes have been identified including LRRK2, whose mutations are the most frequent in autosomal dominant PD (Ad-PD). We conducted a comprehensive mutational analysis of LRRK2 in 30 Ad-PD (11 Japanese and 19 Caucasian) families employing a DNA microarray-based resequencing system and direct nucleotide sequence analysis, and identified 23 variants including two known mutations, p.G2019S and p.I1371V, in three Caucasian families and one Caucasian family, respectively, a novel putative pathogenic mutation, p.N1221K, in one Japanese family, and a known nonsynonymous variant, p.G2385R, in two Japanese families. Detailed analysis of the frequency of p.G2385R among 100 Japanese Ad-PD, 73 sporadic PD (sPD) and 238 controls revealed that the frequency of the p.G2385R variant was significantly higher in Ad-PD than in controls (allele frequency, 9.0 vs 2.1%) (\u03c7(2)=16.32, P=5.34 \u00d7 10(-5)).

The present study aimed to investigate whether these associations are affected by weight. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted among 861 Japanese subjects (males: 65.5%; 61.8\u00b112.3years) attending a health-screening programme. Interactive effects between HNF1A variants and weight status on risk of T2DM or dysglycaemic status were determined. The 27L variant carriers were at higher risk of T2DM and dysglycaemic status than non-carriers, but only in normal-weight subjects [odds ratio (OR): 2.04, P=0.03 and OR: 2.56, P=0.01, respectively]. An interactive effect of the p.I27L (rs1169288) variant and weight status on the risk of dysglycaemic status was found (P=0.04). Age, but not body mass index (BMI), was a risk factor for dysglycaemic status in the 27L carriers (OR: 1.05, P=0.0003), whereas BMI was a risk factor in non-carriers (OR: 1.23, P=0.008). No carriers of 98V were identified, and 487N was not associated with either T2DM or dysglycaemic status in our study population.
